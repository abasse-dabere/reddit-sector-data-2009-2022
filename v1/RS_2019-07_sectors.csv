personalfinance,$4K/mo Mortgage Payment on a House Worth $375K - What Should we do?,"So I went back home for father's day a few weekends ago and stayed at my dad's house where I grew up. We went out to brunch for Father's Day and he was asking me and my two brothers.. ages 30, 38, 22 respectively (our dad is 60), what he should do with the house. Up until this point, I knew the house was under water but I didn't know the specifics.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad told me his monthly mortgage payment is about $4,000 - he has a 1st mortgage of about $345K (adj rate is currently 7.5% and adjusts every 6 months) &amp; a second mortgage of about $65K with a 10% interest rate (so loans total $410K). He had the house appraised recently and it came back at $375K so it's underwater by about $35K.

&amp;#x200B;

How he got here --&gt; Divorced in 2005 and had to refinance the house to remove my mom and do a cash-out refi to give her half the value. This was the height of sub-prime lending and the loan is through a private lender so no FHA government protections and it's not owned by Fannie or Freddie. He may have done a few cash-out refis to pay off debt from raising 4 children (remember that housing prices were soaring and cash-out refis were super easy to get). The loan has been sold a couple of times but the sales haven't been recorded, other than an incorrect recording where they marked the second mortgage as the first mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

The options we were going over:

\- Stop paying and stay until he defaults on the loan and is kicked out (remember, he will be saving $4K a month with this option - he lives in the suburbs of MD so rent is nowhere near that costly)

\- Try and short sell the house. My dad doesn't think the lender has an incentive to short sell because they are making a fortune off him (he hasn't missed any payments). We toyed with the idea of my brothers and I putting the short sale offer in on the house to keep the property in the family because it's in a really nice neighborhood.

\- Keep paying, fix up the house so it is ready to be rented out. It could be rented for about $2,500 so he'd still have to fork over $1,500/month and wouldn't be able to live there.

&amp;#x200B;

stocks,Slowing economic data shows recession; US deficits continue to grow.,"As most of us know Trump and China trade war is just a tactic to keep the market rallying on the same news over and over again until the 2020 election. It really doesn’t matter who wins because our government has been fucking us for decades but I would still rather see trump win. Nonetheless, I believe the market will drop substantially in the coming months and he will not win re-election due to that. After the July rate cut comes through, in October-December we should see the delusion starting to fade and real worry start to kick in. Should be fun to watch the paper gains disappear, because the stock market has clearly gone away from the underlying real economy that has been struggling. In fact we’ve been in a depression for quite some time. Growing substantially less over the past decade than in the past, leaving almost 5 trillion on the table over the years. Whens the last time you saw the federal reserve contemplating a rate cut at the top of a bull market? Exactly, that should tell you something. The balance sheet and interest rates are nowhere near normal and this will cause them to raise rates during a recession and print more money (QE4). It’s time you cash out and watch the fun as people scatter, I’m long gold (mainly)  and eventually some select foreign markets.",finance
personalfinance,Mid year tax issue,"I used the federal tax withholding calculator and had some alarming results telling me to change withholdings to 1 and 0 for mine and my wife's jobs due to oweing 14k in taxes.  We have 2 children and combined take home is 105k. The issue I believe is that I entered 14k for other income due to having a severance and bonus from my previous position however that was my take-home and I paid taxes on it when they paid it out to me, however I didn't see a way to indicate that.

14k seems high for two children and only 105k I looked at the credits and basic numbers and it looked like around 9k was more reasonable.

Here was the actual result I received

 Your Results
Based on the information you previously entered, your anticipated income tax for 2019 is $8,693. 
If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $13,954 withheld for 2019 resulting in an overpayment of $5,261 when you file your return.
To meet your anticipated tax without having too much or too little withheld, complete a new Form W-4 for each job.

Here’s how:

You and your spouse should enter the following number of allowances on line 5 of your Forms W-4:
Job 1 (which has a projected salary of $65,000): 0 allowances.
Job 2 (which has a projected salary of $50,000): 1 allowance.
Check the “Married” box on your Forms W-4.

personalfinance,State Farm Life Insurance - Unsure if it's a good investment,"I recently took over my life insurance that my parents set up for me when I was very young. I'm unsure whether it's a good investment or not as I understand that term policies are generally better than whole life. I would ask my agent, but they're Chinese so it's hard to converse with them and my parents that set it up are divorced.

&amp;#x200B;

Breakdown of myself:

* 27 single w/ girlfriend - looking to marry in the near future with kids
* current salary - \~100k and living at home so low cost of living
* average net worth - \~300k spread across savings and various investments
* Parents are retired and divorced

&amp;#x200B;

Breakdown of Life Insurance policy:

* Statefarm Universal Life - Option 2
   * Benefit Value: 200k
   * Variable interest rate but policy is guaranteed no less than 4% annually
   * Current Account Value: 4.5k
   * Monthly Payments: $75

&amp;#x200B;

Based on my research on this policy, Option 2 allows the account value to be added to the total benefit amount. So, any interest accrued will be returned in comparison to the usual whole life policies. Doesn't this make this life insurance a good investment medium that will always have &gt;4% annual returns?

IPO,Will delay in monsoon affect your strategy of investment?,"Will delay in monsoon affect your strategy of investment? 

&amp;#x200B;

This year's low rainfall is estimated. By Wednesday, the rain was 37 percent lower than its long-term average. But analysts are not worried over this matter. He believes that the effect of less rain will not be so high that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has to reduce interest rates in August. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, due to weakness in rural areas, pressure on sectors related to consumption may be seen. If the government does not announce any relief in the upcoming budget, such a situation can come. Usually, by the middle of June, the monsoon reaches two-thirds of the country. On June 25 this year, it reached only half the count.

&amp;#x200B;

The sowing of kharif crops is a decline of 12.5 percent compared to year-on-year. This year's rainfall deficit has also gone up from 38 percent to 45 percent. In India, half of the foodgrain production and 5 percent of the GPD comes from Kharif crops. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kharif crop depends mainly on the monsoon. Good crop brings prosperity to the rural areas. This increases rural income and increases expenditure. However, brokerage firm UBS believes that good rainfall does not necessarily increase rural income. 

&amp;#x200B;

According to the Australian Meteorological Department, the impact of El Niño on the monsoon has reduced in India. Due to positive change in the Indian Ocean, monsoon will get support. UBS said, ""If the monsoon rises fast, it will have a positive impact on the consumer-related sector and the entire market."" 

&amp;#x200B;

The brokerage has expressed its hope that Nifty will reach 12,000 by the end of December. It said that the relationship between monsoon and inflation has been weak in recent times. Improvement in supply chain has improved domestic and global supply. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) or inflation rate is 46 per cent of the consumption of food items. But there is only 22 per cent impact on monsoon directly on the CPI. Analysts believe that the government has a large stock of foodgrains. Storage of wheat and rice is up to 4 times. 

&amp;#x200B;

Emphasis will be on the rural situation 

In the rural areas, there is a sluggish challenge in demand. According to Goldman Sachs, January-March quarter was the first time in the last 10 years, when revenues growth of 17 companies on its radar decreased. The brokerage believes that this trend will continue for the next two quarters because it will take time to show the effect of official steps. 

&amp;#x200B;

Prabhudas Liladhar said that in the coming 5 to 6 days the rain can reach many corners of the country. This will help to increase crop sowing and agricultural production. However, it has to be seen how the monsoon moves forward. It must also be seen how much rain is received in the next three months. It will also be important for Agrochem companies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Centrum Broking has expressed hope of providing relief from the government to rural India. Trading Bells co-founder and COO Partha Nyati said that FMCG shares can benefit from lower revenues in rural earnings, while more improvement will benefit auto companies.

If you’ve never heard of it, basically it’s this; You pay a flat rate of $9.99 a month, and if your bank account gets to the point where you need a quick loan then the App can put between $80-$250 in your account to cover you until you get a paycheck.

personalfinance,"Car payment, pay more in single payment or pay multiple payments?","Hey everyone! Kind of simple question here that I'm looking to get some insight on. I currently owe $6,000 on my car (2016 Ford Fusion SE). My minimum monthly payment is $230, but I always pay more than that. I signed a 6 year loan for around $12,000, and put $3,000 down. My loan's interest rate is 3.24%.

I've noticed that if I make multiple payments of at least my minimum at one time, it will push back the date my next payment is due by one month each payment. For example, if I were to pay three installments of $230 each right now, my next payment would not be considered due until October (because July, August, and September would be paid for).

But if I were to pay one payment of $690 today, my next payment would be due in August, since it would only be covering the month of July.

My question is this: If I submit one payment of $690, will the extra $460 in that payment go towards paying off the principal and help me pay off my loan faster while paying less in interest in total? What option is better to do to pay less overall interest by the time the loan is paid off? Or are there other options I should look into that will help save money overall?

Also, is my interest rate really high for an auto loan? (24 year old male, around 785 credit, had one car loan prior for a substantially smaller amount that I paid off very quickly)",finance

personalfinance,Old employer 401ks and state retirement funds to new IRA?,"So, I've been sitting on a couple of accounts since changing jobs a few times and I would love to consolidate it all into one IRA I can contribute to, but I'm a little lost of where to start/what my best options are.

I have 2 401ks from previous employers. One is Fidelity and the other is some other provider.

I also have a very sad IRA I opened with my regional bank when I understood even less than I do now, which has an interest rate lower than a percentile and hardly over 1k for the past couple of years. I remember pretty vividly that it was a Roth IRA, but all of my digital paperwork around this implies it's a CD (which makes no sense, but that's what it says?).

Finally, I have a retirement fund from the state of TX from when I used to work at a public university. It's part of the Teacher's Retirement System and isn't much, but is still money I'd like to grow.

I am not eligible for my current employer's 401k until another 3 months from now, but either way I would love to have a separate IRA that is with a provider like Fidelity (or whichever is best in y'all's opinion!). I'm basically at a point where I can't contribute to anything, so I would also like to make sure I'm always contributing a little something to an IRA. I am not sure if I should rollover to a Roth IRA or a Traditional one.

For a little more financial background, my gross income is about 90k, and I have very little debt (auto and cc, but under 10k). I live in an expensive city, but have a fairly affordable rent (pay less than 900). Doing what I can to budget (and using YNAB), but concerned about any kind of 2019 tax penalty I may face if I did have to pay taxes on a new roth IRA (and I have also never done this and don't know how it works). I'm 30 and should know better, but here we are :)

personalfinance,First Time Home Buyer Mortgage Advice,"My wife and I are trying to purchase our first home in St. Louis County, Missouri. We are members of a credit union and the credit union offers a first time home buyer loan, which is not an FHA loan but offers no PMI, no down payment and limited closing costs. I'm trying to decide between taking the First time home buyers 5/5 ARM at the current APR (4.451%) or a more traditional ARM (4.084%) or a 30 year fixed (3.892%). I don't know much about how these numbers compare to other lenders.

The home we are trying to buy is $225,000 and I think we are getting a pretty good price in our city which is an inflated market. We could most likely come up with a 3 - 5% down payment but that combined with the other closing costs would possibly over extend us. We would likely be borrowing from our 401k to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Our background:

We both have older credit issues, but recent credit history is pretty good and my middle Fico Score 4 is 666. We both make over $100k but we have student loans over $200k, $25k in car loans and about $30k in revolving credit. Our highest interest on revolving credit is 8% (due to balance transfers and paying off last month's balance every month) and we are actively reducing the revolving credit balance.

We have two kids, the youngest is entering public school kindergarten this fall, so we will finally be done paying for preschool.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel it would be better for us to use any free money (401k loan, life insurance loan, freed up tuition funds) to aggressively pay down our revolving debts, and put equity into the house so that we can refinance in a few years. I am betting on the fact that its worth it for us to avoid paying the extra costs (PMI, Down payment, etc) up front and paying a slightly higher APR, so effectively including those costs in the loan in which case we could still borrow from our 401k to more aggressively pay down our revolving debts.  My hope is that in a few years we will have considerable equity and lower overall debt and with that better credit get a better rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Several people are trying to make the case to me that we should be trying to lock in these low interest rates. I don't see that much advantage of locking in to the current rate for 30 years. We like the house but I doubt we will live in it for 30 years. If we found something better in the school district, we'd move I think. And I am planning on refinancing in at most 5 years.

I am currently working for an agricultural company making 40k a year, and I have about 50k in retirement savings. I understand I will not be eligible for certain federal loans (Stafford and subsidized) because Ross is a foreign school. The average debt is about 300k for graduates. How can I best manage my finances during/after school? What kinds of loans are best? I know most students take Federal Direct Unsubsidized and Federal Direct PLUS loans, but these have interest rates of 6.6%, and 7.6%, respectively. I have also been researching two programs called Income-based repayment (IBR) and Public-service loan forgiveness. These seem like the most viable options, but I am not sure it would really pay-off in the long run (as opposed to paying my loans back as aggressively as possible from the beginning). Additionally, to use these programs I must take federal loans, which have a high interest rate. My credit score is very good 790s, so maybe there is hope for a lower rate taking Sallie Mae loans? I would be grateful if anyone can offer any guidance, ideas, or programs

CryptoCurrency,"Thinking of Libra, How does an Asset Backed Currency keep Stable Prices?","I believe I read somewhere that Libra will be backed by a reserve of multiple different assets to stabilize it's price. However, I don't understand how this will work. For example, when Libra tokens are open for public purchase and there is a ton of demand to buy them, that will surely increase the price per token. How do they plan to manipulate this? Or say too many people are holding, which drives up the price, so it's more expensive for people who want to actually use the token to purchase any. Will Facebook issue more tokens to drive the price down?  
  
I know the US Federal Reserve does some stuff to manipulate money. For example, lowering interest rates to encourage spending (aka encourage selling the dollar) which will drive down the price of the dollar. But, in general, and in actuality, the dollar is backed by the GDP and value of the nation who issues it. The strength of the nation determines the dollars value. The same as how a stock price is backed by the strength of the business behind it.

personalfinance,Want to improve my credit score to finally start my new life with my new family. What should my next step be?,"So, me(24M) and my girlfriend(22F) have a daughter(7months). We have been living with my parents since our daughter was born back in November 2019. We really want to move out as soon as possible and have our own space, something we desperately need because it’s tough living with your parents when you have a baby. living at home has taken a huge toll on my gf and we’re at a point where living there is affecting her health so moving out is a priority. Now, I’ve lived with my parents my whole life. I’ve also worked most of my life but I dropped out of Community College in 2014. Have been mostly working since and have a good credit score, about 720. My girlfriend was a student at UCLA but is taking some time off to get financially stable and to focus on her overall heath, plus it was very difficult to juggle school, work and raising a baby. Her credit score is in the low 600’s. Her score has suffered because of her student loans($14,000) and maxed out credit cards(3 credit cards, 500, 500 and 200. Total of $1,200 balance). I’ve been looking into our credit scores because I know that our credit scores will be a factor when looking for a place to rent. So I’ve taken the steps to improve my score and pay all my debt. (Only owed 2,400 on a 3,000 limit card).  

I have a total of 3 credit cards and one loan. Here they are:

Curacao Credit Card(store card)- $2,750 limit/$0 balance, 4 years old. 

Bank of America Rewards Credit Card- $5,400 limit(was 2,500 last week but got a credit line increase)/$0 balance, 2 years old. 

Chase Unlimited Freedom Credit Card(I just got approved for this one, will activate card today)- $3,300 limit/$700 balance(balance transfer from Bank of America Rewards Credit Card), 0 years old. 0% interest for next 15 months. 

Moneylion Installment Loan: $500 loan/$400 balance. Opened on March. (6% interest, it’s a credit building loan. Should be paid off Feb. 2020)

My credit score when I applied for Chase Unlimited Freedom was a 720-740. 100% on time payments, CK showed no inquiries(not sure why), 16% utilization. Average age of credit was 2 years. And a good mix of accounts.

My goal is to strengthen my credit score even more and be debt free so that I can eventually help my girlfriend pay off her credit cards and help her improve her credit score. I’ve taken on the role of the accountant for us both, so I want to make sure I take the proper steps. 

My questions are:

1. Should I put her as an authorized user on my BoA Rewards card? The limit on that one will bring down her utilization by a lot it seems. 

2. I wanted to maybe possibly apply for another credit card soon. Maybe in a month or maybe even next week. I’m stuck between the Costco card, Chase Saphire and Chase Amazon prime card. I’m very interested in the rewards and am a responsible cc user(at least now I am) but I also want to get more credit cards because I want to have a “thick” credit score. Is it too soon to apply for another one? 

3. My girlfriend has about $900 saved up. Should she use some of that or all of it to pay off some of her credit card debt to save money on interest? 

4. I’ve been wanting to cancel my Curacao card. If you aren’t familiar with that store, it’s a store that’s popular here in Southern Cali and Arizona. They tend to give credit to ANYBODY. So their interest rates are crazy high and they are an overall sketchy company. However, it’s my oldest card and it makes up about 40% of my total credit limit. Not only that, but initially I tried to use my card to keep it open but found out that they deactivated my card but kept it open. As it shows in CK. To activate it again, they’d have to do a hard pull. Not sure what the best thing to do is for that card.

personalfinance,How Excess Payments are being Applied through Great Lakes Student Loans with Custom Allocation,"Hi everyone,

So I tried researching answers to these questions I had on my own through the Great Lakes website, internet, and former Reddit Posts. So maybe someone else that has made extra payments recently through this company can comment.

For background I have $70k in student loans all through the federal government no private loans. A mixture of subsidized and unsubsidized loans. All are fixed rates except one one with a variable rate. I have 14 total loans under one account which I will list out:

6.8% fixed    $575.15


6.8% fixed    $1,150.15


6.8% fixed    $1,533.69


6.8% fixed    $3,352.98


6.8% fixed    $4,129.82


6.8% fixed    $7,257.83


6.8% fixed    $8,081.87


6.8% fixed    $8,081.91


6.8% fixed    $9,582.42


6.8% fixed    $13,242.01


6.0% fixed    $1,461.00


5.6% fixed    $2,624.01


5.6% fixed    $1,311.95


4.66% variable $3,041.58


My due date is the 12th of every month. I always pay the minimum manually a few days before that date. I don't do automatic payments since I like to review and be in control of the exact  amount taken out of my bank account and to not get complacent.

I also plan on paying off each loan in the order listed above starting with the $575 one.


My questions for excess payments are as follows:

1.) If I want to make an extra payment on top of my minimum payment should I do two separate payments on the same day to avoid any extra accrued daily interest that would be paid with the minimum?

2.) I'm choosing to do the ""Custom Allocation"" option which you can choose where your excess payments are applied to after the daily interest is paid. 

My question is when you have a specific loan selected, for the excess payment to go to 100%, does it only apply the excess payment to the accrued interest on the specific selected loan and then the principle of the same specific selected loan or does the excess payment get applied to all the accrued daily interest on all 14 loans and then to the principle of the specific selected loan?

3.) Before I begin my excess payments should I send an email or snail mail stating my wishes of how and where I would like them applied to or do I need to call each time to make sure they are going to the correct loan.

I know I can choose which specific loan on the online portal but this is just to verify it's applied correctly to avoid unnecessary hassle in the future.

Thank you for all your helpful comments. I just want to do this correctly and efficiently.",finance
personalfinance,"How to build on a solid financial foundation? Early 30's, recently married, no kids (yet).","Hi everyone!

Over the last 7+ years, I have learned a great deal from reading this subreddit and, through the resources available, have been able to successfully stick to a reasonable budget, eliminate reliance on the dreaded ""credit card float,"" establish a 6-month emergency fund, purchase a home and accrue some additional savings.

I am happily married and oversee the finances for our household. While I am not a beginner, I don't consider myself to be a financial wizard either, so I'm hoping for guidance on how to build on our solid foundation and maximize our overall wealth and financial security.

**Background**

We are in our late 20's/early 30's, live near a large but reasonable CoL city in the Midwest and have a combined income of $125K-$150K. I have a fixed salary of $100K with a 10% annual bonus and my husband is self-employed with a fluctuating income.

We have mostly combined our finances, however, my husband pays for his student loans and business expenses (which are minimal) from his business account before transferring a ""salary"" into our joint account at the end of each month.

As a rule of thumb, we try to live conservatively within my base salary, with my husband's income and my annual bonus contributing to our savings and ""fun"" money. Our expenditures also tend to scale up or down based on what we know my husband will earn in the coming months.

We have a 30-year mortgage on our brand-new house and two car loans that will be paid off in mid-2021. We plan to drive these cars until the wheels fall off.

Overall, I feel like we are in a decent financial position, but I feel there is so much more we could be doing, especially knowing we want to start a family in the semi-near future.

Here is a quick snapshot of our current financial picture:

**Monthly Cash Flow:**

|CATEGORY|AMOUNT|
|:-|:-|
|Combined Take Home (avg.)|$6,800|
|Monthly Expenses|$4,300-$6,000|
|Monthly Savings Contribution|$800-2,500|

&amp;#x200B;

**Account Balance Summary:**

|ACCOUNT TYPE|AMOUNT|PRIMARY USE|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Checking|$2,000|Buffer money|
|Short-Term Savings|$3,000|Vacations, auto repairs, house purchases, gifts, etc.|
|Long-Term Savings (High-yield savings @ Ally)|$14,000|Hope to put this to better use.|
|Emergency Fund (High-yield savings @ Ally)|$23,000|6+ months of all necessary expenditures|
|401K (Vanguard Target Account)|$38,000||

&amp;#x200B;

**Debt Summary:**

|**DEBT**|**MONTHLY PMT**|BALANCE|INTEREST RATE|PAYOFF DATE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Mortgage|$1850/mo (incl. Taxes, Insurance &amp; PMI)|$275,000|4.375%|June 2049|
|Car #1|$280/mo|$8,000|3.39%|Dec. 2021|
|Car #2|$305/mo|$6,800|5%|July 2021|
|Husband's Student Loans|$95/mo|$3,000|Unsure|Unsure|

&amp;#x200B;

Given that we have an emergency fund in place, moderate but not outrageous debt and decent savings, I would greatly appreciate any guidance on the next steps we should take. The obvious place to start is to reduce our monthly expenses, however, we have really buckled down on reducing frivolous spending recently so I think we're ready to think longer-term.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are my questions / initial ideas:**

1. Is there a general rule of thumb on how much cash we should keep close at hand (in our savings account) vs. putting into various retirement and investment accounts?
2. Is there a better place to keep our Emergency Fund that would earn greater interest while keeping it relatively ""safe"" and accessible? I have heard of CD Ladders but know nothing about how they work, where you can open one, how much to tie up in it, etc.
3. Retirement feels like our most urgent issue. My first thought is to open a Roth IRA in my husband's name, immediately deposit the maximum $5,500 and continue to do so each year. Any arguments for/against?
4. In addition to maxing my 401k, should I consider opening a Roth IRA or similar post-tax retirement account in my name as well?
5. Is there an investment account that would be a good option for our long-term savings. We want to use this down the road for things like future car down payments, house renovations, big vacations, etc.? This would allow us to make big moves without draining an account earmarked for retirement.
6. Knowing that we will have children in the next 1-2 years, should we consider setting up something akin to a college savings account right now?
7. Regarding our cars, does it make sense to take a chunk out of our savings to pay one off? I used a debt calculator and it doesn't appear that we would save much on interest, so it would purely be to free up monthly cashflow for other things (perhaps extra principal on our mortgage?). But would that be worth taking up to $7K our of our savings?
8. We have thought about refinancing Car #2, but it is due to be paid off mid-2021 and I wouldn't want to extend the length of time we are paying on it. Do banks even offer 24-month auto loans?
9. My annual bonus tends to be about $6-$7K after taxes. We don't calculate it into our budgeting, so what is the wisest use for those funds? Applying it to our mortgage principal? Investing it?
10. Is there anything obvious that I am completely overlooking?

This is already crazy long, so I'm happy to share any additional details that might be useful.

personalfinance,Withholding advice for new job,"Hi, I have a quick tax question for a new job regarding witholdings. My wife got a new job and i'm helping her fill out her tax withholding paperwork for federal and state(California). I'm estimating that we will pull in 180-185 grand total.  Roughly 22 % of it wont be taxed because of 1099 work. Another 19 % of it is withheld at 2. We have two dependents currently but neither qualifies for a child tax credit. We will be adding a new family member (due date feb 20 :). We don't want a large tax bill, and i'm trying to be conscious of the somewhat substantial 1099 income, but we also aren't interested in giving the government a large interest free loan. What do you all think would be an ideal withholding number?",finance
personalfinance,"Almost 30, still in school, massive credit card debt and basically homeless","So, through a series of stupid choices I'm sure this sub doesn't want or need to hear, I've found myself with roughly $30,000 in credit card debt. I've started working with a debt counseling service, who was able to negotiate my interest rates and close my cards for me without writing off any of the debt (minimal impact on my credit score). My monthly payments are now about $600/month, and I have no open lines of credit.

In order to be able to afford the switch to the program (in which I had to pay both the program and my debtors), I borrowed $3,000 from my 401k. As long as I stay with the company less than 100 is deducted from my paycheck each month to pay it back, but if I leave before the loan is paid, I have to pay the entire thing out of pocket.

I was about to get full time at my current job (I'll be making roughly $16.50 an hour, 40 hours a week), and was going to take 2 evening classes a semester for 2 more semesters. Online is not an option. 

The money for the classes comes out of pocket initially, but at the end of the semester my company pays me back.

I was going to continue living with my parents/siblings until I graduated, then immediately look for higher paying work.

I currently have $700 in my savings account.

However, due to an actually diagnosably crazy ex boyfriend, I've been forced to vacate my home and hop from couch to couch. All my friends are married, so this is a major inconvenience to them and can't continue much longer. I have NO perspective roommates.

Rent within 20 minutes (no traffic) of my area for a studio apartment averages $900, not including utilities.

I've looked into every hardship program I can think of, including my company's, but nothing directly applies to this kind of situation.

It seems to me like I have three choices; get a second job and give up on school for a while, take a higher paying job and give up on school indefinitely, declare bankruptcy and have no trouble whatsoever with rent and school, or try to set up a page for charitable donations (which feels wrong because in my eyes this is a self-created scenario).

I have a question regarding my current situation and the option of re-financing that my lender just reached out to me about. I closed on my home back in October 2018 so I have only been it it for a few months. I put 5% down so I am paying PMI currently. The main appeal to the new loan to me is it would lower my interest rate from 5.125% to 3.875%. From what I've read the general ""rule"" is you want to have at least a 1% lowering of interest if you are going to re-finance but I know there are other factors. This would lower my payment by $306 a month and save me $90,000 over the course of the loan based on my lenders numbers if I stick with this mortgage for the new 30 years. Both mortgages would be a 30 year conventional fixed rate mortgage. The home is in Tacoma, WA and the market here is hot right now based upon comps with property value steadily increasing the last few years. What are some other factors I should look into? I know that lenders are in the business of selling mortgages so I just wanna make sure I do my due diligence before committing to this. This is also my first mortgage so I am just overall in unfamiliar waters. Appreciate any help or guidance provided! Let me know if there is any other information I should include to help with advice.

Planning to hang on to the home for a long time and rent it out as an investment property.

EDIT: Here is the cost to refinance breakdown sent over from my lender as well:

*On the costs below heres how the breakdown*

1. *Fees=3599.00*
2. *Pre-paid items—taxes, insurance, interest… you pay this stuff regardless if you refi or not=4044.00*

*We can apply the funds from your current escrow account to the 4044.00 for the new one, which will be about 2,000 to 2500 but if you have your mortgage statement and can send me a picture I can tell you for sure how much…*

*So if I can credit you 2500 from your current escrow account, that would leave the total cost at 5143*

*But then you skip 1 payment of 2876*

*So that leaves 2267 in costs to recoup… but at the savings of 305 per month, you recoup the remaining costs in 7.4 months.*

*And overall in the long run this saves you 90k over your current loan.*

*So basically as long as you don’t refinance or sell the property in 7.4 months you made your money back and its all savings from there*",finance

I also spend around $400 on groceries a month and then the rest either goes to paying off my debt or ends up getting spent on eating out or unforeseen circumstances.

personalfinance,I don't think I even know what mortgage points are anymore,"I'm in the middle of a loan application. The lender has written and revised the loan offer a few times, in part responding to competing offers I got after completing the form on Lending Tree.

&amp;#x200B;

To start, my wife and I opted to go with the very large lender that we've both used in the past. They told us that since we'd both had mortgages with them previously, we were eligible for some special discounts. My wife handled the upfront negotiations. But she indicated we would save a few thousand in fees.

&amp;#x200B;

**Offer 1:** This deal started at 4% and I bought the rate down to 3.25%. It included an origination fee which was 1%, the maximum you're allowed to charge on a VA loan. (My wife is military.)

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't feel confident with all the numbers. The initial rate was higher than other banks were advertising. And it seemed like we were getting a lot of fees and only $1,000 in discounts. And I thought the loan officer was a bullshit artist. He just talks and talks and doesn't answer your questions directly.

&amp;#x200B;

This is when I filled out the form on Lending Tree and started talking to other lenders. Since my wife is military, there are some banks that offer special deals to people in the service. One bank in particular offered us 3.5% and no origination fee. Rather than just switching then, I figured I'd take this info back to our original lender and see if they were willing to match it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Offer 2:** Same as offer 1 above both with the Origination Fee discounted.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, we did a home inspection. The house needed a roof, they weren't willing to fix it or discount things. So that contract fell through. The VA loan would have fallen through, a roof is a deal breaker for them.

&amp;#x200B;

We found a new house. It's a few weeks later and the market has changed a little, with interest rates trending down.

&amp;#x200B;

**Offer 3:** They offer us 3.5%, bought down to 3.25%. The origination fee is back on the loan at 1%, even though our discussion about removing it was pretty memorable. The loan officer also messed up the purchase price on this deal. We made an offer below the listing price and it was accepted. This means that instead of looking up the price in the offer document our real estate agent sent him, he must have looked it up own Zillow or something.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked him to adjust the purchase price and take off the origination fee. Here's where it gets interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Offer 4:** They list the interest rate at 3.25%. But in the origination fees, they change the points to read 1.625% with me providing about $7,000 at closing. They leave the 1% origination fee listed. Then they discount that 1% in the Lender Credits toward the bottom line. So back in offer 1 we were getting $1,000 off, in this offer it's that $1,000 plus the whole 1% origination fee. In this deal, I don't pay the origination fee (which is only like $12 per month over the course of the loan), but they've replaced it with me putting up an extra $6,000 at closing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking, ""what the heck is this all about?"" And then the loan officer and his boss talk circles around me for like 40 minutes. They're telling me I can get a tax write-off for the points I bought. Cool about the taxes, but on paper it sure looks like you made the deal worse on purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

*Some questions:*

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do I understand what buying points is? My understanding is, they offer you 3.5%, you put up a quarter of a percent of the loan amount and you can buy it down to 3.25%. Is that correct?

&amp;#x200B;

2. Is it normal for them to bring you an initial loan offer that has you buying down a portion of the points? Every single offer they've written showed me initially buying down a portion of the points.

&amp;#x200B;

3. In offer 4, if the interest rate is listed at 3.25% and they show us buying 1.625% in points... doesn't that mean they started at 4.875%?

&amp;#x200B;

Additional details if you want to run numbers: Purchase price is $455,000. Home is in Colorado. We aren't required to put anything down on a VA loan, but intend to put down 5%.",finance
personalfinance,How $300 in damage to your car can cost you thousands.,"This comes up from time to time and I felt that this needed a post.

Let me preface this by saying that I'm a dealer and I probably run, I dunno, 20+ Carfax reports a day and evaluate 20+ cars a day.

A minor accident, say a scuffed bumper, when reported to the Police, will generally end up as an accident reported on your car's Carfax/Autocheck report.  I would say that virtually every accident that's on a vehicle history report (VHR) is from a police report.  Period.

Now, on a late model car this is, as a general rule of thumb, about a 10% or so hit to your car's value even if the damage was very minor.  In an extreme example that comes to mind was a year old Bentley Continental Convertible where a $1,000 claim to repair a scuffed bumper ended up costing the owner $30,000 in lost value due to the car having a ""bad Carfax"" (YOU try selling a year old Bentley with an accident on the Carfax... I dare you).

So, if your car has very minor cosmetic damage, you may want to think it over before you make a police report if you can avoid it.  If your car is in a legit accident, go ahead and make that report.  But if you come out of the grocery store to a scuffed bumper, you may want to reconsider making that report.",finance

personalfinance,I want to start my new life with my new family and so I want to work on my credit score. What should Be my next step?,"So, me(24M) and my girlfriend(22F) have a daughter(7months). We have been living with my parents since our daughter was born back in November 2019. We really want to move out as soon as possible and rent our own space, something we desperately need because it’s tough living with your parents when you have a baby. My gf’s credit score is in the low 600’s. Her score has suffered because of her student loans($14,000) and maxed out credit cards(3 credit cards, 500, 500 and 200. Total of $1,200 balance). I’ve been looking into our credit scores because I know that our credit scores will be a factor when looking for a place to rent. So I’ve taken the steps to improve my score and pay all my debt. (Only owed 2,400 on a 3,000 limit card).  Right now my credit score sits at a 720-730

I have a total of 3 credit cards and one loan. Here they are:

Curacao Credit Card(store card)- $2,750 limit/$0 balance, 4 years old. 

Bank of America Rewards Credit Card- $5,400 limit(was 2,500 last week but got a credit line increase)/$0 balance, 2 years old. 

Chase Unlimited Freedom Credit Card(I just got approved for this one, will activate card today)- $3,300 limit/$700 balance(balance transfer from Bank of America Rewards Credit Card), 0 years old. 0% interest for next 15 months. 

Moneylion Installment Loan: $500 loan/$400 balance. Opened on March. (6% interest, it’s a credit building loan. Should be paid off Feb. 2020)

My credit score when I applied for Chase Unlimited Freedom was a 720-740. 100% on time payments, CK showed no inquiries(not sure why), 16% utilization. Average age of credit was 2 years. And a good mix of accounts.

My goal is to strengthen my credit score even more and be debt free so that I can eventually help my girlfriend pay off her credit cards and help her improve her credit score. I’ve taken on the role of the accountant for us both, so I want to make sure I take the proper steps. 

My questions are:

1. Should I put her as an authorized user on my BoA Rewards card? The limit on that one will bring down her utilization by a lot it seems. 

2. I wanted to maybe possibly apply for another credit card soon. Maybe in a month or maybe even next week. I’m stuck between the Costco card, Chase Saphire and Chase Amazon prime card. I’m very interested in the rewards and am a responsible cc user(at least now I am) but I also want to get more credit cards because I want to have a “thick” credit score. Is it too soon to apply for another one? 

3. My girlfriend has about $900 saved up. Should she use some of that or all of it to pay off some of her credit card debt to save money on interest? 

4. I’ve been wanting to cancel my Curacao card. If you aren’t familiar with that store, it’s a store that’s popular here in Southern Cali and Arizona. They tend to give credit to ANYBODY. Some even argue that they favor bad credit. So their interest rates are crazy high and they are an overall sketchy company. However, it’s my oldest card and it makes up about 40% of my total credit limit. Not only that, but initially I tried to use my card to keep it open but found out that they deactivated my card but kept it open. As it shows in CK. To activate it again, they’d have to do a hard pull. Not sure what the best thing to do is for that card.

25 y/o female - guidance counselor - current base salary $42,000 - side hustle cash $800/month - Pennsylvania state teacher retirement pension plan - Maxes out $6K Roth IRA. Maxes out $7K HSA contributions (Employer contributes $2.2K to HSA). Outstanding Debt $27K @ average rate of 4.2%.

Low monthly expenses due to living in old storage area turned to apartment owned by parents. We only pay for oil $800/year for their home and ours, electric $25-30/month, groceries, cellphones $90/month, Disability Insurance $35/month, Life Insurance $330/year, Car Insurance $1200/year, Gym Membership for both of us $25 total. These are the main recurring expenses off the top of my head.

**Past Year:**

Today marks the first anniversary when I first calculated our net worth which on 7/1/18 was: (-$230,493) and this year, 7/1/19: (-$148,988). The strategy has been avalanche debt repayment on the wife's higher student loan debt which started at 75K January 1, 2018. Due to high principle, we wanted to max retirement accounts and circle back on student debt repayment since we do not pay rent.

**Next Year:**

**I NEED YOUR HELP:** Over the next 6-8 months, I plan on having my wife's student loan completely gone but then I'm unsure what goal to attack next. Here are my 5-7 year goals and I need help prioritizing them. Here they are in no particular order.

1.) Pay off my student loan debt

2.) Replace my car: 2006 Chevy Impala with 70K miles - ($1200 in repairs over the past year)

3.) Replace my wife's car: 2012 Honda Accord 120K miles (only minor maintenance repairs over the past year)

4.) Vacation of a lifetime - 2 weeks in Italy visiting Rome, Capri, Amalfi, etc. for a minimum of 10 days ( a dream my wife and I always had). \*Can't do with children\*

5.) Downpayment for a home (will most likely be my parents home currently assessed at $320K). We do have an excellent relationship with my parents so downpayment could likely be under 20% but I want to be honest, fair, and keep recurring mortgage payment low to maximize investments etc.

\*\*In that time my wife and I would like to have 1-2 kids around the ages between 30 y/o and 32 y/o ideally!

Side Note: Wondering if I should pump the brakes on my student loans 171K through my parents home equity line of credit ( originally to decrease interest rate) due to the possibility of ""student loans being wiped away"" and invest in a taxable account to achieve all other financial goals.

I work in tech support for a relatively small program company. Our company is small in terms of staff, much less than a hundred, but we have hundreds of companies who use our program / software. I have been working here for about a year and a half now. From the start the training process took about a month to 2 months, learning the program:

• From a consumer stand point (which reports do what and pull from where, how to do basic day to day functions a front of house staff would do in the program, etc)

• Internal stand point (where certain data is stored, how to pull up specific locations in the servers, various errors and how to troubleshoot them, how to install the program, how to set up printers to work with the program, how to configure and troubleshoot payment processors which are integrated into the system, adding necessary information into the firewall, etc)

• SQL (such as select and update statements crossing information from various tables of data) and how to correct any errors in the database. 

• Basic networking for any company locations such as forwarding any port information for point of sale devices and printing from our servers. All of which is done by connecting to the customers computer remotely.

• Utilizing the mobile apps we have available to our customers along with the common errors and how to troubleshoot them. 

• How to utilize a different program we use to catalogue all incoming calls and emails so every customers problems are heard and fixed accordingly. 

All of this for an entry level position starting at roughly $11USD an hour. 

On top of all of that, we have to be courteous and kind to our customers (which is easy enough for me), and learn how to ask the right probing questions to see what the real problem is. There is little to no documentation on how to troubleshoot any problems that come up if we don't know it off the top of our head, so we almost always have to either send it up the chain for investigation or ask our team members. In reality, training takes about 6 months until someone is actually comfortable with the daily workflow and not completely lost with a call. 

Very recently we were absorbed into another company which is a point of sale company. Hooray for our pay going up to roughly $12USD an hour! This works well as now it is much easier for both of our customers to get everything they need in one! Although, we are the first company they have tried a new method with and we are having troubles with their hardware. I feel silly for not noticing this before but that company does not have a technical support team for their hardware as we are the first to implement the change. So we are all expected to troubleshoot those problems along with our usual duties of monitoring our call volumes (which is always a high wait time due to a total of about 15 technicians staffed when no one is taking leave), documenting all our troubleshooting methods if we fixed it or not, etc. 

I'm grateful to have such a high paying job for my area, seeing as there is no other technical support jobs other than Geek Squad, although I'm beginning to feel cheated out of pay that  I, and my fellow coworkers, should be getting paid. In the next state over there are technical support jobs paying 25$ an hour!! But understandable for being a big city. 

So I come out of desperation to you, Reddit. From a mid 20something who is so overworked and hating their job due to being overworked: is $12USD an hour, before taxes, a fair wage for what's expected as listed above? Thank you for your time reading, and understanding my vagueness in my job description so I don't get yelled out by my bosses.",finance

Essentially, I am currently $39,265.27 in debt.  *I have not touched or paid any of these accounts for the past two years*.  I just got overwhelmed and also did not have the funds.  

My currently income is seasonally dependent - it is summer here right now which means that I am getting a better paycheck whereas in the colder season my paycheck drops.  My work is also entirely commission based so I can't tell you exactly how much I get paid but I can try to do an average.  I get paid every 15th and last day of each month.  For the summer months, I'm currently making about $1200 per paycheck so about $2400 a month.  For the winter months, this has gone as low at $900 per paycheck so $1800 per month.

My expenses for the month amount to about $1500 if I am *very* conservative and have no impulse spending and no eating out.  This amount would cover my rent, groceries and car payment.

My mother told me to file for bankruptcy - I had entertained the idea until I realized that filing for bankruptcy does not get rid of student loans, which I think makes up the chunk of my debt.  

My question for you guys is should I still file for bankruptcy since I have not paid any of these debts in any way shape or form for the past two years?

If not, then... what do I do?  Please help.

The friend I am currently living with might start a family soon, in which case I would need to move out to give him and his family some much deserved space - but I can't do that if my financial situation isn't good enough for an apartment that is going to run my credit and see it for the shit that it is.  Mint is saying my credit score is currently at 438 whereas experian says its currently at 530; either way, my credit score is poor.

I went to an expensive college, had my family sign off on the parent plus loan, majored in a foreign language.

Had no internships lined up.  Dropped out of LSAT prep classes and decided didn't want to become a lawyer (which is why I took the loan).  Decided I can become a successful entrepreneur instead.

Well, many mistakes, 6 years later and still procrastinating, just moved back home and got a job earning $50k working in entry level b2b Tech Sales.  

Comes out to ~$2800m after all said and done, insurance, 401k.

I got to help out my family now and cannot put more than a $1000/m towards debt.

$80k parent plus loan, %7.625 .. currently covering interest only.

$20k Federal loan at %4.15 .. covering interest only.

$7k credit card debt %3.75 .. prioritizing paying this off.


So, it looks like I need to get a 2nd full time job or start coding or offering services because unless I do something incredibly powerful and out of the box, I'll spend my entire 30s paying off my loans with 0 going towards savings.

personalfinance,What's the best thing to do with 50K from sold house?,"Hey all. Long time lurker who appreciates the great advice that you all give. I finally have a question for the community.

We're about to close on the sale of our first home and after realtor fees, paying down a small bridge loan etc, should get about 50k out of it. I have lots of ideas for what to do with the money, but am not really sure what makes the most sense overall.

\- Convert part of the new house into an Airbnb (5-10k), should net us 500-1000 extra a month.- Get out from under PMI for new house. (Would take about 33k, PMI is about $100 a month. mortgage rate is 4.25)- Pay off student loans (about 25k left out of 85k 7 years ago, yay! 700 a month, around 5.5% interest)- Invest in a relatively liquid way (using wealthfront or vanguard index funds)- Other stuff? (I already invest a modest amount and max out my roth IRA. My wife has a nice pension plan through state gov, but we don't currently contribute to a roth IRA for her).

Other info quickly. Between my wife and I we make about 150k a year gross, we bring home around 115-120 after taxes and insurance. however, we have pretty high expenses because of choices we've made--namely 30k a year we pay in day-care/private elementary school for our two kids. We also give 15k or so a year to charity/church. New mortgage payments (including taxes, insurance) is around 1800 a month. We're also not the MOST disciplined spenders, but I wouldn't say we're terrible either. Mostly we just get tired of cooking and eat out once a week or so. No car payments or anything else like that.

My first plan was to do the Airbnb, and then get out from under PMI. Just in the past few days, however, I'm been thinking that Airbnb and then wife's Roth/ other investment makes more sense. I was taught, growing up in a really frugal/responsible home, that paying down debts should always be first priority. However, as time has gone on, I've started to think that my money can get better average returns on the market than my debt's interest rate. And more importantly, the flexibility of having money available opens up other financial opportunities down the road (down payments for rental properties, for example, or other local investment opportunities). What makes sense to you guys? Is there something that I'm missing?",finance
personalfinance,[FL] How do I manage my car payments (if I’m unable to return the car)? When/how can I lower them?,"Alright, so I made a huge mistake by signing for a 33k car over 6 years. I got absolutely fucked with 15.96% APR. I am fully admitting the absolute dumbassery and full retard I went. I am obviously filled with buyer’s remorse. I am fighting tooth and claw to try and return the car, looking over the contract with a lawyer and trying to speak directly with the dealership about returning it. (If you have any legal advice about this process, it would also be greatly appreciated!)

But I need to know what I need to do in order to manage my payments in my worst-case scenario, and how I can get those payments lowered. My budget boils down to this: I have no financial obligations outside of the car and the insurance, *both of which I can afford*. I make roughly ~1600 monthly, and my payments with insurance are ~969 monthly. How can I utilize the most of my surplus?

Secondly, when is the quickest I can refinance, and my best possible options? In November I will be part of the Navy, and I have heard that the Navy Federal offers phenomenal rates to refinance. Will I be able to take advantage of this, or any refinancing option?

Thank you so much. Again, I realize I’m stupid, but I need to weather the storm of my idiotic antics.",finance
personalfinance,New job suddenly increased in responsibility significantly,"TLDR at the bottom

After working at a company for 2 years as an hourly/tipped employee, the position that I originally wanted to work in was finally created. I interviewed, got the job offer, negotiated my salary (+3,000) and started 6 weeks ago. 

The person who was my supervisor just let me know she is leaving the company. Several of her major responsibilities are being handed off to me, and no indication has been made by upper management that they plan on offering more compensation. Some of these responsibilities I'm looking forward to, and some (namely taking over social media) I am very much adverse to. Obviously I will want to be paid more if I am expected to do some of the most essential parts of another person's job, but the company I work for is notoriously *frugal*. That is actually the reason why she is leaving. 

They likely will not hire a replacement for her, as she was basically doing 5 jobs since she was hired, and she has spent the last 6 months convincing them to create new positions to properly do these jobs. 

As I said, I've worked for the company for two years, but as a new salaried employee, I feel I don't have a lot of leverage to renegotiate my compensation. The amount of work they are expecting of me will be very demanding: already I work weekends and often have over 12 hour days when we have events, but now these new responsibilities will likely require me to be in the office m-f consistently. 

Some additional things to consider:
- I do have flexible office hours right now (as long as I can respond to emails I can often work from home, not sure if that will continue) 
-Work has some perks: bring my dog to work, free beer, was *supposed* to have the ability to take longer vacations during the off season
-This is my first salaried job and first job in this field-- my experience limits me from seeking out another job
-The salary already feels small in the shadow of life/debt/goals/family etc. 
-Salary is 38,400 currently. To warrant a guess, I think my supervisor was probably making 43,000-47,000.
-I moved cities this weekend to be closer to the main location, this new city has a much higher cost of living.
- I expected this, but I've taken a paycut coming from a bartender to this salaried position

Any insight on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated. 

TLDR: 6 weeks after a promotion, my supervisor quit, and many of her major responsibilities are being handed off to me, and do far there is no indication of an increase in my compensation. Advice on renegotiating salary?",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,My credit score dropped significantly after paying off one of my student loans...,"I have two student loans. One in the amount of 8000 dollars and the other in the amount of 4000 dollars. I’ve been slowly paying both off over the past two years at more than the monthly minimum. 

Because I got a higher salary job and have been saving money by moving in with my parents, I decided to pay off the entirety of the smaller loan (it also has the bigger interest rate)

For context, I have 2 credit cards. One I opened last year (Amazon Visa Rewards card) and one I opened 3 months ago (Uber card). I have paid my bills in full each month. I have never been late. I have never used more than 30% of my credit limit. 

My loans are 6 years old each. 

My FICO score (shown in m Uber card from Barclays) went from 747 to 683. My Transunion credit score from my Amazon chase card went from 736 to 649. 

I was under the impression that settling student loan debts wouldn’t affect my credit score. Now I’m afraid of what will happen when I payoff the bigger loan which I planned on paying off by the end of August this year. 

Is it possible it’s something else that dropped my score that drastically? The only thing I did recently was pay off that student loan.

I started a five-year financing plan on a new Scion back in September 2015, so I'm a couple months shy of the four-year mark at the moment.  The initial monthly payment was something like $170/month, but for a few years I paid $200/month or more just because I could.  Now, with 14 months left on my payment plan, my outstanding balance is just over $1100 and Toyota's site shows that the next payment I owe is $150 on April 3, 2020 (I think because any additional payment I've made in the past goes towards the next month's payment rather than the principle, so I don't currently owe a payment for nine months).

Anyway, I've been thinking for a few weeks now that I want to just pull a bit of money from my savings and pay off the car when the balance drops below $1000, but it just now occurred to me that paying off this loan would close the account on my credit report after 3.75 years, when it might be better to let it run its full course of five years so it will have slightly less impact on my average account age.  I think that's what I'll do instead, but I wanted to post here anyway just to see if anyone has any tips or advice to share.  Any feedback would be welcome!

personalfinance,Low Interest Loan to Pay High Interest Loan,"Hello PF!
FTP/LTL, but I have what is more of a thought-experiement based off a real life scenario.

So, to set the scene. My girlfriend is from and studied in India, and her student loan isn't massive, it's about £17k (comparatively smaller than a lot of people's!), but the interest rate is high. Like 13% high. Now luckily her father pays off the interest each month, and so she just pays a lump sum of her earnings every couple of months, which equates to a few thousand coming off each quarter. Unfortunately we live in one of the most expensive places in the UK (£600 each for rent) (long term plan to move back north to cheaper places) and so this is the limit of what she can pay without having nothing left after rent/bills. I'm currently saving up for a mortgage and she doesn't want me to lower my savings to help speed up the repayment period).

Now, hopefully that's given you some context, here is my question. I realised that it is quite likely she could get a loan here with a much lower interest rate (perhaps even 3-5%), use that to reduce her loan significantly, and then pay back on the lower interest rate.

It almost sounds too easy, and I suspect there are a few pitfalls with this. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Can anyone think if this would have a significant detriment to either her or my finances (we share a bank account so our credit scores are somewhat linked)? 

Of course we can continue the way we are, what with her not paying any interest directly, and both of us on decent salaries (~£35k each) with her paying it off fully in 24 months if she went with £700 a month.

personalfinance,"Approved for mortgage and going to settlement, should I refinance student loans for better rate?","Hello all,

I am currently in the process of closing on the purchase of our first home. We were approved for a mortgage and will be going to settlement potentially at the end of next month. After figuring out the numbers and future bills and what not, we are going to be comfortable with money after the mortgage payment. I was wondering if it would do any harm to refinance my student loans before settlement. Currently I live with my parents and pay $0 a month in rent, which obviously helps the DTI when trying to refinance. 

My balance on my private loan is currently a little under $54,000. I refinanced last year so now I’m on a 15-year term, less than a year into it and I pay $490 a month with a 6.47% fixed interest rate. My mom is also a co-signer on this refi. 

In the last year I’ve substantially built up my credit, and I’m making more than I did last year. If i refinance to another 15-year term with no co-signer my new terms would be: 
Monthly Payment: $438 
Fixed APR: 5.39%

If I refinance now, I’d save a little over $50 a month but my interest rate would drop well over 1%. 

My concern and my fiancée’s concern is what the bank’s reaction would be if I closed one major installment loan and opened a brand new one shortly before closing. 

Has anyone had any experience with this/have any potential insight?

personalfinance,Should you have access to your Emergency Fund immediately?,"When I say immediately, like, instantly. Not within 1-3 days. Here's my dilemma. Wife wants to keep our emergency fund (6 months worth of expenses) in our chase savings account which gives 0.01% interest. I want to use an online savings account, the one I found was offered by [Ally](https://www.ally.com/bank/view-rates/) with an interest rate of 2%. She liked the idea because Ally advertises the fact that they use Zelle. Now, we have used Zelle before, and in theory it is instant (within a few minutes) to transfer between accounts, assuming both account holders are registered Zelle users. In this case, both our Ally account and our Chase account are registered with Zelle, however after recent testing something weird occurs. 

When I send money from my chase acc to my ally acc, through Zelle, it appears instantly in the ally account. Not 1-3 days, *instantly*! HOWEVER - when I send money from my ally acc to my chase account (still using Zelle) it says it will take 1-3 days. It's been over an hour and hasn't shown up in the chase acc (I did a small test with only like $10). So I'm assuming it won't be coming through until 1-3 days have passed. So my question is, does this matter? How liquid does an emergency fund have to be? 1-3 days liquid? Or 5 minutes liquid? My wife talked about the hypothetical: What if one of us gets in a car accident and has to pay for medical emergency NOW, not within 1-3 days? What are your thoughts? Where should we be storing our emergency fund, in our regular savings acc (0.01% APR), in an ally online savings acc (2.1% APR), or perhaps something else entirely?",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing question,"Is it worth it to refinance a mortgage for less than 1 percent? I (SF, 31) bought a townhouse for 175K last year with 10% down at a 4.625 interest rate. With all the news around lower interest rates I've talked to a few different lenders and have found I could drop down to a 4% interest rate, maintain my current payment schedule of 29 years left, and save about $35 a month (still including PMI in the loan for now, but hoping to drop that in about a year). I could also drop down to a 25-year mortgage, also at 4%, increase my monthly payment by about $30-40 a month, but save almost $40k in interest over the life of the loan. I have three semesters of grad school right now, which I'm cash-flowing as I work full time, meaning money is a bit tight, but the end is definitely in sight. My only other debt is $1500 I owe my parents for help with tuition the semester I had to take two classes at once.

I'm not sure the re-fi to save $30 a month is worth it, but I'm somewhat intrigued by the second option, which could save me a lot of money in interest, even if the monthly payment is a bit higher. Like I said, cashflow is a bit tight at the moment because of grad school, but once I get to the point of knocking off PMI it would almost cancel itself out.

Just curious what sorts of things I should be thinking about when considering re-fi options. I do have a meeting with my financial advisor where I'll be discussing this as well, but always like to get as much info as possible from various sources :-)",finance
personalfinance,I am 23 and have 40k in student loan debt. Should I sacrifice my ability to live independently and close to my job in order to pay it off in a third of the time?,"I graduated college last year with about 80k in cumulative debt between financial aid and private loans. My entire life, my dad told me he'd pay for my college, but unfortunately during my sophomore year of school he was laid off from his job of 25 years and needed to use most of his savings and liquid cash for our family. We basically came to an agreement that we'd take out loans and split the balance. I think I'm at approximately 35k now after paying $450 each month since I entered repayment on the loans. The average interest rate is like 6.5%, and I'm in a 10 year repayment plan.

&amp;#x200B;

I also work in the city, approximately 1:15-1:30 by train away from my house. I'm currently making 65k/year and renting an apartment thats \~20 min walk from work for \~$900/month including all utilities. My lease is about to be up and one of my roommates is moving out, so my rent will go up to $1200/month. Honestly, I can easily afford it, but I was doing the math and realized that if I move back home, I can use that money as a loan payment each month and be done with my loans in 3 years, saving myself \~$10k.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been living in this apartment for about 5 months now (short term lease) and I was commuting to work from my house for the first half of my first year at work; it sucked SO MUCH. I was waking up at 5am to make it in to work by 7:30am, there were never any seats on the train due to the high volume of commuters, and I'd have to transfer trains 3 to 4 times. I'd come home late and exhausted and I would never be getting enough sleep, which led to both my work and social life suffering a little. Not to mention the cost of the train tickets was about $400/month and it's gone up since I moved.

&amp;#x200B;

Living so close to work means I get those 3 hours of my life sitting on the train everyday back, which is huge to me. It also means I don't have to live with my parents, which was a really tough adjustment after a great 4 years of college with awesome roommates. However, being able to pay off my student loans in such a short amount of time (about 2-3 years) and using that freedom to travel and do whatever I want is also a big deal. Does it make a lot of financial sense to make this tradeoff?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Wow thanks for the helpful suggestions guys! To answer a few questions 

1. My rent is actually $2400 split b/w 3 people. It's a NYC apartment so this actually considered cheap here. One roommate is moving out, the other is renewing and is in different towards having 1, 2 or 0 roommates (rich parents). We will likely be getting a third roommate, I just mentioned using this new sum of money as if we were splitting the apartment two ways as my potential debt payment because when I initially saw it I thought ""surprisingly, I can actually afford that.""
2. My commute wound up being 1.25-1.5 hours each way because I had to transfer trains 3 to 4 times in the morning in order to get to my office. NYC is laid out kinda weird and if your office is in Queens or Brooklyn and not Manhattan, commuting can be a fucking nightmare. My days were essentially; wake up at 5am, get home by 7pm, and you have 3 hours to do basic human stuff like eat and exercise before you have to go to bed. Not much time for anything non-essential.
3. Cost of commuting was no joke. I was spending $300/month on the railroad ticket, $121 on my metrocard, and \~$100 on gas to get to the train station in an old beater car. So it is something to consider that I forgot; if I moved home, I'd actually be saving a net $300 due to travel. This isn't super cut and dry though, because living at home means that my food costs go down by a TON (literally only paying for lunch, parents stock the house and Mom likes cooking) so I'd probably actually be saving \~$600/month.",finance

Bitcoin,Why aren't people spending Bitcoin?,"The main problem to me isn't fees or speed. The main problem is privacy.   
The direction businesses are onboarding Bitcoin is counter intuitive.   
Pretty soon you will be able to use Bitcoin virtually everywhere with Bitpay or something similar.   
Without privacy every purchase is an additional capital gains tax slapped on, or Bitcoin tax, depending on where you live.  
Which can be as much as an additional 20% on top of any other sales taxes you might have PLUS transaction fees.   


Does privacy even solve this issue? In the case of the feds, this would be considered avoidance and evasion.   
Will people risk it? There are privacy solutions but in the end making purchases online usually involves giving up a mailing address at the very least which really doesn't prove a whole lot but still seems risky.   


It's nice to have Bitcoin as a store of value but gold already does this. What makes Bitcoin especially game changing other than it's decentralization is the way it can be transacted without banks and middlemen which if exploited could be devastating for for those institutions.

I'm 29 years old and I recently received a promotion and salary increase at work which has, for the first time in my life, left me feeling comfortable financially (yay).  Just a few short years ago I was jobless, on the last month of my unemployment benefits, and had very little left in my savings account.    Now I'm at a point where I have about 6 weeks pay in my checking, 2 weeks pay in a savings account (with 2.4% annual interest rate) and I just started contributing to a 401k.

What else can I do to get ahead?  Should I be playing stocks?

I like to play it safe with my finances but I'm not totally risk-averse.

A more detailed history of my personal journey for anyone that's interested:

&amp;#x200B;

I was actually training to be an Architectural Technician throughout my late teens / early twenties. That went belly up during the recession (2008) here in the UK and my whole office was made redundant before I could finish my studies. Finding another role had been fruitless after months of looking, so I thought screw it, and decided to retrain in something I enjoyed more - which at the time was 3D Modelling (I was really into Architectural Visualisation). This meant going to University for the first time at 26 years of age. Because I had gotten made redundant in September, a lot of courses had already been fully stocked and so my options were pretty limited. I was fortunate enough to be guided towards taking a Computer Gaming &amp; Animation Technology course, because ""they do a bit of 3D Modelling in that"" - which was good enough for me! I loved gaming too but for some reason had never considered a career in it. Anyway, I was committed to giving it a shot, so I packed up everything and moved down to Cambridge.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward about a year and I hadn't done a single minute of 3D Modelling, but I was having a blast at Uni, and I was learning tons about the entire game development cycle. Towards the end of the year I was doing a part-time job at the Uni (late shifts) and just so happened to get chatting to a careers advisor that was supervising one night. She asked me if I'd ever heard of a company called Jagex, that were based in Cambridge - and recommended I check them out. I did just that, and the very next day I emailed them to just let them know who I was, the course I was taking, and whether they could add me to a candidate database for when I finished my studies. They replied quite quickly and told me about a student programme they ran that offers people work experience for a year, and encouraged me to apply. Again, I'm a go-with-the-flow kinda guy, thought ""OK then"", and put my application in. Apparently they would get upwards of 500 applications to this scheme, so I had low expectations of succeeding. They initially narrowed candidates down via an online assessment, if you made it past that stage you were invited in for a full assessment day (tests, group activities, 1-to-1 interviews, etc), and it was only after that stage they would make their placement offers. I was fortunate enough to get offered a placement (IIRC there was about 20-30 of us in all) so I feel extremely lucky given the amount of competition there was. I spoke to my Uni, who gave me their blessing to take a year out and off I went to work for Jagex in their Player Support department (essentially Customer Service) on RuneScape.

&amp;#x200B;

Jagex was pretty incredible really, and I instantly felt like I had finally found what it was I wanted to do as a career. Skipping ahead a bit, I picked up more responsibilities in my role, taking on Bug Tracking for example, which eventually led to me being offered a role as a Quality Analyst on a permanent contract towards the end of my placement. I decided to accept the offer, and ended my studies prematurely (I felt it was too good of an opportunity to turn down). After spending a couple of years in that role, I then went to work as a Software Test Engineer for Microsoft, working on Forza Horizon 2 - which was just amazing. I had such a great time there, but sadly had to leave that role sooner than anticipated due to personal family issues (I was on 1 year contract but left after 7 months). I did still get my name on the credits though which I'm incredibly chuffed about! 

&amp;#x200B;

After a brief hiatus from the industry, I returned again in 2015, back where it all started - at Jagex! I got hired as a Senior Quality Analyst, and after about a year moved into a new role as an Associate Producer. Jagex ran a great scheme called TAPP (Thursday All-day Personal Projects) which meant you could do as you please for the entire day (within reason) every couple of weeks. This was to encourage people to skill up or get creative – which I absolutely loved. It was during this time that I started to mess around with game development, initially in Unreal before moving onto Unity (the Unreal learning curve was too steep for me). Later that year, Jagex held their very first Game Jam for staff, and I convinced my pal that we should work on a game. We'd talked about making games for years (going back to 2012) but never got off our asses to do it. So we came up with an idea, and entered the Game Jam as a two-man team. We were pretty committed too, I think we got maybe 10 hours of sleep each over the space of 4 days, and came out the other side with what we thought was a pretty terrible prototype. Amazingly, during the review day it got quite a lot of positive feedback from our colleagues, and I think someone described it as ""having a charm"" to it. The prototype was missing so many elements from our vision though, and we really wanted to see it through to the end, so we sought permission from Jagex to continue developing it in our own time - which they kindly agreed to (waiving the IP of the title). 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 4+ years, and after countless hours spent during the evenings &amp; weekends, a fair few all-nighters, and showcasing the game at many events, we are almost at the finish line! It’s hard to describe the feeling I have right now really….I suppose it’s a mixture of relief, exhaustion, pride and vulnerability all rolled into one.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been obsessed with games since the days of being glued to Sensible Soccer on the Amiga at 7 years old, so it feels absolutely amazing to now be releasing my very own game. I wish I had began my gamedev journey at an earlier age to be honest, but I’m not actually sure I would have coped without the fantastic tools and online community that are available these days. Either way, I’m still thrilled with the progress so far and that I’ve arrived at such a monumental personal milestone.

&amp;#x200B;

Holy smokes, you deserve a high five if you read all of that! Thank you for taking the time to read, I hope it was at least mildly interesting :)

I see her point, but I also do not want to put myself in debt that can follow me for YEARS. I want to work and put myself through school, but I am nervous about getting overwhelmed. 

Any advice? Thanks in advance for reading.",finance

personalfinance,401K vs Debt how should I invest,"So Im learning all about this stuff. I plan on reading and learning more on Saturday when I have 12 hours to just learn and read and take in all the info. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for some info. I have been investing in my 401k through Fidelity, Vangard 2055 Target for 4 years now, Company match at 5% and an extra 1% per 5 years to a max of 10% so currently I have 13%. Im 27 about to be 28. I make about 30k a year, with OT I make an extra 8k (I'm careful not to hit the next tax bracket). I'm not married have one kid and one on the way. I rent would love to own but don't see that happening for a while. SO doesn't work due to medical and has been turned down for SSD. credit score is good I always pay on time, but do have outstanding debt. and I have no saving which I know I will be told off for, but I understand the importance of an emergency fund.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a credit card max is $4500 currently sitting at $4492, and hasn't moved down for years. my interest rate is dumb and through chase at 21.24%(If I understood there site). I asked to see if I could lower it they said no. I have 22k invested through Edward Jones, However I can't touch it without paying penalties for another 3-4 years been making good growth. I have a 5 year auto loan through a credit union, Currently 3 years into the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

I've considered taking a private loan to pay off the credit card and reduce my 401k to the base of 5% to pay off credit card debt. After that my goal is to split my 401k into different funds. 1/3 to a higher risk investment. and leave the 2/3 in vanguard 2055. After meeting with the Fidelity rep today he said I might consider a IRA or standard 401k 2055 if Im looking at moving funds around. What can you guys tell me or recommend, that includes from my debt to investing my 401k.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly I also have a meeting with my Edwards Jones rep and we are going to go over choice and what not, just to get another opinion. and for a third opinion I will be talking to my dad. He has done really well for himself and investing for their retirement and to have plenty left over to give us.",finance
personalfinance,Auto loan refinance companies that offer lower interest rates?,"I need help looking into refinancing my auto loan as I am paying too much interest. I am currently with Capital One Auto paying about $6,000 in interest fees with almost a 9% rate. My credit score is 720+. What other loaners can I go to for a lower interest rate? I did google searches but some of these companies I have never heard of so I do not know how trust worthy they are.

CC3 CB: $710 Min Payment: $50 CC Limit: $1050 IR: 29%

&amp;#x200B;

Sorta budget (working on it, hoping for more guidance here):

Income: $3200

Monthly bills:

Phone: $73

Car insurance: $110

Minimum Debt payments: $860

Food: $\~200

Netflix/Music: $25

Job doesn't offer retirement plan so I will be looking for a company to do this with, but currently do not contribute to anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I make about $3200/month. I just started this job and will get my first full pay period paycheck on the 15. I get paid twice a month. I had issues with credit cards in the past, and as you can see, am now paying for it. I now have a much healthier relationship with money. I just started this job and would like to start throwing money at my debt, and get better credit cards and use them properly. My goal is to have all credit card debt gone, as well as get my consolidation loan paid off, or at least as low as I possibly can.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  I am looking to spend about 700-800 on rent monthly. I will be getting an apartment with a friend. The only thing bad about my credit score is my credit-debt ratio and credit utilization. I have made all my payments all time, have had a credit card since 19, so about 5 years of credit history. I am working on making a proper budget now. I like to cook and stay with my parents currently so I do not spend too much money on food. My only current issue is that at my job we either eat fast food for lunch, or you eat cold food, due to being somewhere new everyday. Currently I have been eating fast food, but am looking into my options on bringing lunch, so I can eat warm food for lunch. I know it has been said time and time again about staying with the parents as long as you can, but I need to get out. At the latest, September is when I will move out, but for my mental health, the earlier the better.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, how do I attack my debt best to get a decent credit score to not worry about being declined, all the while saving for a deposit, admin fees, application fees, and whatever else? Not too worried about furniture and the likes. I have been collecting a lot of things this past year that I know I will need to furnish an apartment, and I can live with the minimum for the time being.

Also, when paying down debt, the credit card companies seem to report to the credit bureaus at the end of the month. If I end up making a payment in the middle of the month, will that show up on a credit report that an apartment company can see, or will it have to wait until the end of the month?

I imagine that the powers that be will, in their stubborn desire to have a crypto they control, initiate and propose a hard fork from bitcoin that will have all the control and surveillance and regulatory features they want. Granted... it will also fail. But what stops them from trying to declare their fed-friendly apostate “bitcoin” as the true crypto?

System is 7.44 kW, 24 panels @ 310 watts each.  Panels are Silfab and inverter is Solar Edge SE6000H-US.  

I have a 25 year warranty on the panels and inverter.

Installer has a 5 year warranty on installation

Total price is $21,600

($6,480 on federal tax credit)

($8,001 SREC income)

The above system would cover 101% of my usage based on last years numbers.

I've done a ton of homework and feel good about all this.  I figured this was a good place to have people chime in.  Since they are a local company they don't offer any financing but have partnered with a local credit union.  The credit union doesn't do much compared to some of the national installers.  I'm tempted to pay cash and just pay myself back.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, is this a good deal?

Can I get a lower price by telling them it's a cash sale?

Are these SRECs correct, it seemed pretty high to me...

Is there anything else I'm missing or I should know?

I spent well over 3 hours to try and get it to fucking launch. Why? Because the developers decided that in creating Linux support, they were going to support one of the smallest subset of users out there. And that’s NVidia users running a version of Ubuntu that’s practically identical to theirs. Have AMD and forced to use Mesa? Tough shit. Running any other OS than Ubuntu? Fuck off (also rip literally every Arch user with this game).

With the rise in Linux gaming, all we’re seeing is lazy ass ports like this where you either have a computer identical to the development team’s or you can’t play. What fucking system is that?

personalfinance,Advice on best way to pay off debt/creditors to improve credit,"I know this gets asked a lot but I'm not finding much info on what is the best option for improving credit. Long story short, I was partially stupid in college (loans and when those didn't cut it I maxed out credit cards) partially got dealt a fucked up hand (had some hard times, fell behind on a lot of payments that are now in collections or charged off) but here I am. I will try to be brief but break it down:
I have roughly 30k in federal loans that are in deferment
Roughly 11k from Sallie Mae I pay on monthly (260$/mo)
19k on a car loan (380$/mo)
I have one private loan (6k) that got charged off. I called the loan provider and set up a payment plan for 110$/mo. They said I can settle for less than owed for 40% (roughly 2500$)
First question; is it better to pay off the 40% quickly or continue to make the monthly payment until the whole amount is paid off? Currently they're not reporting the monthly payment so it still shows as a charge off on my credit report. 
Then I have about 12k in credit card debt that has been charged off. Almost 3k of it shows up on my report as in collections, I can""t find record of the rest. 
What should be my priority to pay off? The open/in good standing accounts (my car, Sallie mae and the federal loans) or the collections accounts? 
Should I settle the collections accounts for less or try to pay off the whole amount?
Should I just wait for them to fall off my credit report?

Right now if we budget tightly we have roughly 800- 1,000/mo to put towards savings/debt payoff. I put 150$ into a 401k and am putting the rest into an emergency fund. Once we have enough in the emergency fund I was planning on making settlement payments to collections accounts. I want to pay off the private loan first because my mom is the cosigner and understandably not happy that it is a charge off. I feel really guilty but I'm also a little bitter because she pushed me to get the loan my first semester in college, it was in good standing for years before I moved home to help her when her fiance died. My husband and I supported her emotionally and did as much as we could to help her pay bills but it set me back financially and around then is when I started falling behind in payments. Well when they started reporting the late payments she just got mad at me but refused to help, by the time I could afford to get back on track they had already charged it off. She's now trying to refinance her house and texting me randomly to remind me to ""kindly pay that shit off"".
I know I have an anxiety causing hopeless mountain of debt and not a lot to fix it, but I at least want to be strategic about how I do it. Please help me internet.",finance

im sure that i could prove i didnt make 23k bc im hoping i still have most of the pms with customers saved as csv files somewhere, tying their paypal emails to bitcoin addresses where 86-90% of the money went that obviously isnt mine. but even if i can find it  i dont have a way to print it out or anything like that and i dont what to even do with it to begin with.  i dont know what to do bc the guy from irs  simply shut me down instead of helping me.  my dad is being far from helpful as well .

personalfinance,GAP Insurance Question,"I'm not sure if this is even the correct place to ask this but I figured I would start here. My (now) ex girlfriend totaled my previous car that she was using while I was recovering from a broken ankle. I had full coverage and owed about $18,000 still on the loan as I had only had the car for a little over a year. My insurance determined the value of the car to be $15,000 since apparently the ex was not taking as good of care of the car as I thought and had scuffed the bumper and been smoking inside of it. I was super relieved to have GAP coverage through my loan as I was told they should cover the amount that my insurance did not. Long story short, they took close to 2 months to pay out and in the end only paid for $2400 of the $3000 that was left on my loan. 


During that 2 month period I had already gotten a new car as Enterprise (where I bought my car) assured me that everything would be fine doing that instead of waiting for all of the insurance details to work themselves out. I ended up having to pay the extra $600 out of pocket to get my new loan to go through and am in kind of a crunch now but I can handle that. My question is that I noticed that my actual car insurance company (Progressive) offers loan repayment through them for just over $4 a month. I obviously chose to get GAP insurance again since it helped me out in my last situation but I'm pretty sure it is through the same GAP company. Does anyone know if GAP through Progressive would be worth it to get? Progressive was a dream to work with compared to the GAP company. I'm pretty sure the GAP I have now cost around $750 on top of my loan but it's still early enough that I could take it off and get it refunded. Thanks in advance for any advice.",finance

\- early 30s male

\- $200k in student loan debt from an MBA program. 100% federal.  currently on IBR paying $0... interest compounding

\- Unemployed, got fired recently because I became non-functional at work due to anxiety.  Not really speaking or forming coherent sentences.

\- Bipolar, but not disability-level

\- anxiety/depression so severe I am not functional.  Not able to get disability since I can walk around and feed/bathe myself, but not in a stable situation I can hold down a job.  Not sure how I can get out of the mental trap I'm in now... been seeing multiple psychiatrists/therapists over the last 5 months and I am basically a stressed-out zombie.  I know, I'm mentally weak, sorry :(

\- Living with fiance, who makes good $$.  She knows about all the mental and financial problems, and still wants to get married in a few months.  Says she will support me no matter what.  So, homelessness at least seems out of the picture.

What if I don't ever work again, what happens to the debt on IBR after 20-25yrs?  Or if I get some minimum wage job that I can hold down and is 0 stress?  Presumably the IBR loans are compounded with interested to an insane amount of like $1m+... but then what?  She wants to buy a house (in her name)... I know I am thinking too far ahead, but I honestly don't think I'm going to ever ""get right"" in the head to make this work out.  

&amp;#x200B;

I never expected to be in this situation when I took out the loans, I was functioning great with bipolar and everything was awesome for 8yrs post-undergrad.  During my MBA I was also fine.  I've collapsed completely and the only way out I see is suicide (which would be horrible for my family and her) or being a burden and living with her and being a ""house dad"" (which would also suck but she says make her happy and I would be alive) or somehow pulling out of this mental trap (but I've been trying for 4+ months with professional help to no avail).

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on the IBR situation, if I don't end up being a functional member of the workforce in the future?  Ways to become ""collection proof""?",finance

personalfinance,Wondering if it makes sense to buy a house from my dad,"So I am 27 living and working in a major East coast city and my family lives in the suburbs of said city. My dad owns a few rental properties (all commercial) except for the house that he has offered to sell to me. It is the house my grandfather bought back in the 70's and my dad lived there for about 20 years so there is some sentimental value.  

Currently the house is valued around $600k, a few years ago my dad took out a credit line to invest into his then struggling  business. He owes about $330k on the house now and rents to a family for around $3500/m (it's worth noting the property is a 5 bedroom, 3 bathroom detached home with 4 car driveway and mother-in-law suite, ideal for subleasing). He has had some bad luck with tenants abusing the property and between his business and his other rentals, he is getting burnt out. He has offered to sell me the property for the remaining balance of the credit line because he wants it to stay in the family. 

I make $70k a year with about $20k in federal student loans left. My biggest expense right now is rent which is costing me $1,500/m. I have modest savings and an emergency fund, but in my city, I wouldn't expect to be able to afford to buy a place for another 5 years or so. My dad has suggested I live in the mother-in-law-suite and rent the upstairs out or vice versa if my roommate decided to come with me to the suburbs. 

I am anxious about this added responsibility but also would be thrilled to stop paying the exorbitantly high rent in my city. I used to balk at the idea of moving to the suburbs but now that I am getting older it seems more attractive. My question is, can I actually afford this?  I'd be responsible for the homeowners insurance, taxes and maintenance of the home. My dad has said the offer stands if I want to wait a year or two, so if not now, what target should I be aiming for to make this work? I would really like to take this opportunity but I don't want to get in over my head.",finance
personalfinance,27-year old Marine Corps Veteran w/ 1 yr remaining in Law School,"Hey all, so, this summer is my first summer where I have lost a major source of my income (a housing stipend provided by the VA). I have lost $3,200 a month since June 1st, going until October 1st. (October’s paycheck pays for the month of September when I am back in school). I currently work two jobs, which somewhat keeps me afloat, but barely. 

My savings is essentially gone and I have a few options to stay afloat and take out some debt that has accrued. The options are below. 

1. Taking out a loan on my motorcycle, which I currently own outright. I have an 800+ credit score, so interest rate would likely be minimal. 

2. I am leaving my part time job in August because I need to focus on school and externships that I will be doing, with that, I can liquidate my $12,000 401K and pay the penalty and taxes on it. 

I am considering this because likely where I will end up working, I can quickly make up the $12,000 loss from my 401K. But, I think this is probably the worst option. 

3. I own $19,000 in Apple stock, $3000 of which are vested RSUs. I would sell $6,000 worth, which should get me through to October on top of my current income.

ethereum,Decentralized Price Feed?,"Would love a developer or engineer's opinion on this idea for a decentralized price feed my friend came up with, he thinks it won't work, I think it could. We bet an eth on the answer so whatever insight people have would be appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, for background, obviously MakerDao is one of the biggest eth success stories, but the oracles providing the eth/usd price feed are still relatively centralized. Chainlink is working on a hardware solution that is compelling, but now you're trusting intel or whatever other chip manufacturer is out there. (ha ha) If nothing else, trying to figure out how a more decentralized and trustless price feed could work is a fun problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

his idea was that you are never going to get a truly decentralized usd:eth price feed, but you might be able to generate a good enough fake one by using one piece of universally acknowledged information, and one pretty safe assumption. 

&amp;#x200B;

The piece of information is the ICO price of eth, which was $0.311.

&amp;#x200B;

The safe assumption is that, on a (semi)-decentralized system like eth, there will be multiple and competing erc-20s pegged to the USD.  

&amp;#x200B;

Taking these two together means that it should be possible to write a script with instructions like ""Find erc-20 trading for eth at  \*some multiple of the eth ico price\* and also with each other at a volume above X and a volatility below Y."" 

Whatever multiple of the eth ico price enjoys the most volume when exchanged with erc-20s that meet the volatility and volume threshold becomes the ""stable coin price index feed."" And this feed could be used to secure a set of CDPs like the ones administered by Maker. Such a feed would not so much compete with Maker or Coinbase, as rely on their efforts to produce stable coins like Dai and USDC, efforts which, presumably, will trade with eth at some multiple of the ico price, and also with each other with relatively low volatility, compared to everything else.  more stable than any single stablecoin might be an average of all stable coins that meet certain requirements. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is how my friend put it:

 

""There should be way of using the ico price of eth to generate a ratio internal to the system, comparison with which would turn up a high correlation with the internal price of competing stable coins. Thus creating not a real decentralized usd:eth price feed, but a decentralized feed that observes and reports on the herd behavior of all the different 'fake' ones. You wouldn't be trusting this or that centralized set of oracles, but rather just the likelihood that, across a decentralized system, there will be some number of competing actors making attempts at stability, guessing that those attempts will cluster around some shared relationship to eth's original price and reporting on how much volume and depth exist in proximity to these various guesses. 

The smart contract would say, I don't know what the eth price is today, but I know that at one point in the past it was $0.311. Furthermore, I'm guessing that there have been multiple attempts at building a stable coin since then, that these attempts enjoy markedly more volume and depth that other erc-20 as a result, and that all of these attempts are likely clustered around one possible answer to the question: how many times has eth increased in price since ICO? so today it would look and see that, yes, low and behold, usdc and dai are both doing x volume with x depth as though they were pegged to the dollar and eth had increased \~1k times. Even more encouraging, they are trading for each other as though they were competing to be pegged to the dollar.  The feed indicates what the price eth appears to be, assuming that there is a clutch of high volume, high depth, low volatility stable coins competing with each other to price eth in terms of the dollar. this answer may not be the 'right' one, in the sense of being fed into the system from the outside world, but it is the popular one among those attempts to mirror that same phenomenon inside the system, and this might be good enough, or at least a good enough to complement the alternatives in a way that encourages their good behavior. 

in other words, a decentralized oracle might only need to say: i don't know what the price of eth is, but I do know a whole bunch of dumb motherfuckers are trading around a bunch of unusually stable erc-20 as though the price of eth had gone up 1k times, which would make the price of eth around $311 - and that is the value that is fed into the cdp's or whatever else. Its essentially a price feed assembled from a stable coin index.""

personalfinance,"Credit card payoff: take out a personal loan, or 0% APR balance transfer cards?","I've been chipping away at my credit card debt the last year and am picking up steam lately. I've gotten to the point where I feel motivated and am on a solid budget and am tracking every dollar.

Total cc debt is $18k, down from over $30k! (Hey, I'm getting there...) The card carrying the bulk of my debt at this point is a Navy Federal Visa with $15k. Luckily the interest isn't super high, but it's 11.24 percent so I'm still getting hit with decent charges each month. I was going to open up a couple 0 percent APR balance transfer cards to eliminate a good chunk off the Visa and help snowball its payoff even faster (while making sure not to keep using it for purchases), but I'm wondering if there's any downside to doing this as compared to opening a personal loan through something like SoFi where I could pay it all off immediately and consolidate the debt into one monthly payment.

Thing is, personal loans I've applied for all seem to have *higher* interest rates than my current card... So it makes me wonder why people even use them? I was quoted around 18 percent as an APR on a personal loan thru sofi.

So long story short, I am wondering if there's some kind of catch or downside that I'm missing with my strategy of the balance transfer cards versus opening a personal loan. What do you guys think? The two cards I'm looking at opening are Discover (two years of 0apr) and Citi (I believe 18mos).",finance

personalfinance,"23 y/o, new job, no savings, 80K debt, looking to get PhD, what should be my priority for my finances?","Hi, long time lurker, first post so let me know if I'm doing this all wrong. I know I am in a bit of a tough spot financially so I'm really trying to learn as much as I can and would love recommendations and advice from others. 

So I went to a private university, I got a bachelor's in molecular biology and Biochemistry and a masters in Biotechnology, and now have a great job. Sadly great job doesn't equal big $$. I'm making 44k a year. I have approximately 80K in student loan debt (68K in federal loans varies from 3.7% to 7.6% interest, 18K in private loans at 6.2% interest). I plan on refinancing some of my loans to get some of the larger interest loans down from 7/6%. Any advice on good refinancing options or what to watch out for? 

I'm hoping to pursue a PhD in about 2 years, which on average makes about 32K in my area a year, (while in the PhD program) so I'd like to save up a little before then.

I'm wondering what would be my best strategy now. At this job should I contribute to a 401K? There is no match until I work here for two years, so I am thinking about just getting the money to start saving for an emergency fund, then to start paying off these loans. However, coming from a family where my parents have practically no 401K and are close to retirement age is certainly a bit stressful to think about. 

If I should consider a 401K I'm a bit confused what I should choose, it gives me the option of Fidelity or TIAA? I've tried understanding it in simple terms but honestly don't know where to begin so any advice in that area would also be helpful. 

Some other background: I can't live at home so I live in an apartment that I split with roommates. With utilities it gets me to about $850 a month. I have a second job that makes $13/hr that I do nights and weekends occasionally. No car, free transportation to work. No other debt.

I am 28 years old with three kids 2 months, 3 years and 6 years old. My fiance is a licensed electrician and makes good money. I am on maternity leave, in Canada, for 12 months. We have two vehicles we are still paying for. A truck, which was a want for my fiance and a minivan, which is a need with three kids. The truck payment is $382 bi-weekly and we currently owe 48k on it.  The resale value is 40k (not trade value). Our bills with the truck payment total over 4100 a month. This leaves us with 1300 ""disposable"", which isn't disposable because whatever is left goes to credit card debt. We met with a mortgage broker and we need the truck loan paid in full in order to debt to service for a 450k mortgage. We have a lot of other debts I would like to be rid of before buying a house. I feel like we are nowhere near ready, but my fiance really wants a house and is happy to get rid of the truck in order to do so. I think we need to get rid of the truck and pay off our debts with the money we are saving on the payment and insurance before we do anything.

I need to tackle this, but need advice on how. The highest interest rate is on the Scotia bank Visa @19% 

I want to sell the truck, but dont have a clue how when we owe more than it's worth. How do I do this? Would it be smart to take out a loan for $8000 and sell it? This hurts a bit to think about. We can definitely survive with one vehicle. 

I assume for the credit card debt we make minimum payments on them while paying off the highest interest rate card first and then the next one from there. Is that the best way to go about it? 

I truly wish we could put all if this debt together and pay one payment monthly, but I believe that looks like a bankruptcy on our credit report? We have good credit right now, so I dont want to do anything to jeopardize it or that new house in the far future won't be an option.

So, I want to write an API that the Zabbix server can hit to request the current water status of each plant. Then it will alert me when any drop too low. This will require one analog input per plant, currently five. Ideally the SBC would also have wifi built in, but if not, I can always use a USB one.

Part two of the project is to then water the plants automatically with a gravity-fed solenoid. This will require one digital IO pin per solenoid, also five.

personalfinance,Not sure what my taxes will be like at end of year - working FT job and PT for Instacart,"I'm trying to keep track of what my tax situation might be like at the end of the year, and I have no idea if I'm doing things right or wrong, or if there's anything else I could be doing to put myself in the best situation possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work FT making about $46K yearly salary. Every year I take the standard deduction, file as single, no dependents, and I pay student loans so I get to put that interest on my taxes. I don't own property or my own business or anything complex. 

&amp;#x200B;

This year due to extra bills and trying to pay things off faster, I started working in my free time for Instacart. This is in addition to my full time job. Instacart doesn't take out any taxes as you go, they just give you whatever money you earn weekly. I've looked on the InstacartShoppers subreddit and tried to do some research, but most advice I've seen is geared towards people doing IC as their only job, which makes them ""self-employed"" and they say to prepare for paying 25-30% of your income in taxes, and to keep track of all your mileage and phone bills (since you use your phone) and count those as deductions when you do your taxes. I also know if you're self-employed you're supposed to do quarterly tax estimates, but since I have a FT job on top of IC I was told I don't need to do that, and I haven't because I was having a hard time figuring out how, and I thought I would save myself the trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I have a regular job where I pay state and federal taxes, I'm not sure what amount or % of taxes I should expect to pay. I think with the amount of IC I do, I'll still be better off taking the standard deduction instead of itemizing, since I heard the standard deduction is going to be upped to $12K. I do also pay some medical bills every month, but that total per month is around $70, and I don't think with IC mileage or phone bills it would go over the $12K standard deduction, unless I'm missing something. 

&amp;#x200B;

At my regular job, I currently have $20 withheld from every paycheck, with 26 paychecks a year, which is $520 withheld for the whole year. I also add $300 to my savings every month, which is more than 30% of what I make with IC /month, so I will be able to pay whatever I owe to taxes at the end of the year, I'm just wondering if anyone has a good way for me to calculate what that might be, or if they see any flaws in how I'm doing things, or if there's a way to do them better/more efficiently that could save money?

personalfinance,Is a loan with a lower interest rate advisable for paying off credit card debt?,"Basically as the title says, I'm trying to determine if it's advisable to search for a loan that has a lower interest rate than my credit cards to pay them off and consolidate my debt.

My interest rate on the cards is in the neighborhood of 18%, but I got an ad from a loan company recently (bestegg) talking about APR as low as 5%.

But since Roth 401k is post tax, and traditional comparatively lowers your taxable income, it would be logical to assume that the entirety of your Roth contributions are technically taxed at your highest marginal rate. Or in other words, if you contribute 10k before taxes on a 120k salary, then making it a Roth contribution means you pay 24% federal on it as opposed to traditional when you get taxed later. 

But if traditional 401k money is taxed as income when it comes out, then that income would be taxed at an effective rate where the first 10k isn't taxed and so on. 

Is that correct? I'm assuming effective tax will be higher than my current highest marginal bracket anyway, I'm just confused.",finance

I think it's important to remind ourselves why certain days are dubbed National Holidays. The 4th of July being ""Independence Day"" is no exception.

One of the major factors why our forefathers &amp; Founding Fathers left England was to seek independence from the tyrannical Bank of England. These visionaries benefited from their courage, but they knew that a similar banking system would eventually try to emerge in the future.

personalfinance,Extra Payments on Navient High Interest Student Loans,"I was trying to find an updated version of this, so I apologize if it's been asked before, but I hope it helps someone else too.

I want to make extra payments on a student loan with a high interest rate.  Right now, I'm paying about $150/month on this particular loan.  I'm able to put an extra couple of hundred on the loan, but I just want to make sure it's applied properly. Navient updates their website a lot; hence, this post.

&amp;#x200B;

Navient gives you this warning on their site, ""If you make an Overpayment on some or all of your loans, you may advance your next payment due date, which can cause a future Auto Pay payment to be processed as an Overpayment.""

&amp;#x200B;

If you go to your profile, you have some options to adjust this.  I don't understand the following options : Allocation Direction 

*The Allocation Direction allows you to tell us how you would like your Overpayment allocated across your loans. (If you are not the primary borrower, please click the information icon above for additional details.)*

**Highest Interest Rate.** The Overpayment amount will be paid to your loan with the highest interest rate. \[It is currently set at this as the default\]

**Highest Current Balance.** The Overpayment amount will be paid to your loan with the highest Current Balance.

**Lowest Current Balance.** The Overpayment amount will be paid to your loan with the lowest Current Balance.

**Prorate Across Selected Loans.** Prorate means that we will divide the Overpayment across all the loans you’re paying. The calculation is based on the Monthly Payment Amount.

**Unsubsidized and Private.** The Overpayment will be prorated by Monthly Payment Amount across your Unsubsidized and Private loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Under this I have the following: 

*We’ll always apply your Overpayment toward your Current Balance. When you make a payment that is equal to or more than the amount of future monthly payments, do you want to be billed for your full Monthly Payment Amount? (If you are not the primary borrower, please click the information icon above for additional details.)*

Billing Direction.**No, Advance my due date by the number of payments I cover.** Even if you have zero amount due on your billing statement, continuing to make payments will reduce your total cost of borrowing. \[Currently set at this option\]

**Yes, Bill me for my full monthly payment.** You will be required to make a full monthly payment with your next billing statement.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm assuming, I'm going to select the last option...bill for the full monthly payment.  But I don't know if I should adjust the options under overpayment amount.  

&amp;#x200B;

When you go to the Make a Payment option...they give you two options--1. Direct an Overpayment 2. Specify for each loan. I'm assuming to make extra payments, I have to select option 2. But then they have this disclaimer at the bottom when you get to the Specify for Each Loan pop-up. ""**Did You Know?** If you make an Overpayment on some or all of your loans, you may advance your next payment due date, which can cause a future Auto Pay payment to be processed as an Overpayment."" I'm not sure if I should ignore that after I adjust the option in my profile to bill for the full monthly payment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my situation:

1. I am mid/late-30s and live in California, USA.
2. I do not have a house, nor car, but know how to make this work and keep my expenses low, about $1,000-$2,000mo.. Most of my net worth is tied up in crypto, currently \~$125,000. But we all know those winds can change. That is my retirement money. I have an additional $30,000 in a bank. I work irregularly as a freelancer and consequently try to stay very liquid in case of an emergency or dry spell with work. I fully subscribe to everyone having a suitable liquid emergency fund.
3. I have no revolving debt...once in my 20s digging out from a mountain credit card debt was enough, and I promised myself to never carry a revolving balance again. If I can't afford something immediately, it is a luxury I have not yet earned.
4. I see the debt-free finish line. My total remaining student debt is \~$850. (Down from a $30,000 principal fifteen years ago.) The interest rate is an absurdly favorable 2.8%. My loan payment is $114/mo. For anyone reading this, yes, I know that is low...there was an opportunity to consolidate in the mid-2000s and I took it. I have no idea how I'd afford school now at 6%+.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question is: What are the pros/cons of paying off this remaining student debt early?**

I could put the same $850 into crypto and in nine months, it will (likely) gain far more than the interest I will have paid. Or even an index fund would be solid.

But there is also the *psychology of just being* ***done*** *and debt free*. How does one evaluate the opportunity cost of that feeling against ""smart choice"" to wait and continue to pay it off over nine more months? That is nine months of stress.

All comments welcome. I'd really just like to hear second opinions and I'll reply as best I can. Thank you.

Throughout her life, my mother (65 y.o.) has accumulated A LOT (\~300k) of debt. She also owes about 300k on her house (valued at 1.3M). In an effort to reduce her interest rates and consolidate her debt, she's taking out a 30-year home equity loan for 600k. She asked my brother (32M) to cosign. Mind you, he has his own debt and makes about 45k/year at most, and I don't think he truly understands the implications of being a cosigner. From what I understand, as soon as this loan goes through, he has a 600k debt to his name. With his income, I don't understand how he'll ever qualify for another loan ever - so his chances of owning his own home one day will be shot. And if my mother defaults, it's a strike to his name as well, right? That could take years to recover from?

Am I overreacting, or is this truly the impending disaster I am envisioning? And hey, I understand my mom makes bad financial decisions so please, please don't insult her.

personalfinance,Less Student Loan vs. Head Start on IRA,"First time on this sub - I've lurked in this sub to know that many of you here know a lot more than I do about managing personal finance, so I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  

Title is self explanatory, but the background is pretty important.  

I'm a professional school graduate student, and I am in my last year of school. I currently have approximately $34k in loans, and I am on course to graduate after an taking additional $40-50k in loans over the coming 16 months or so (approximately $80k in debt at graduation in 5/2020 - likely first paycheck afterwards in 11/2020). First scheduled repayment is on 12/2020. These loans have a 6-7% interest rate (after this year, my weighted average interest rate will be around 6.5%).  

I am currently in an internship that, in more cases than not, results in a full time job offer. Given everything so far, I believe it is probable that I will have a job with a first paycheck around 11/2020.  

All that said, I am currently contemplating between maxing out my IRA contributions this year and just borrowing that much less in the coming months. Functionally, this will be equivalent to taking out a loan at 6.5% rate to contribute to IRA. I know this is unreasonable in most scenarios *BUT*  

I am liquidity constrained until I start my job since the job, if I get it, will likely be for a $190k/yr that I expect to hold for at least a few years (with annual lock-step raises). I will be in a high-local-tax market, so my first year take-home should be around $100k. I think I can pay off the loans reasonably quickly without too much of a belt-tightening (modest projections suggest 3 years; possible lower rate refinancing as well). Consequently, I see this as a question of the long term (20+ yrs) benefits of starting an IRA a year early VS less loans/risks in the medium term (~5yrs). I am a pretty risk averse person, so my investment returns will likely be lower than the loan rates (especially given risk exposure). In case it is relevant, I am in mid twenties, so I am a *very, very long* way from retirement.  

I found a few discussions online on the subject, but most were for current workers contemplating paying excess income towards paying off existing student loans vs higher IRA contributions. I would love to hear your thoughts on the pros and cons of lesser loan vs an earlier IRA. Thanks!",finance

I recently switched jobs and left a company after 9 yrs. I have $9K in a pension fund and $20K in a vested 403b account from the old job. My new job has a retirement fund as well that I'm now contributing to. I plan to roll over the $20k from the 403b into my new retirement fund but I'm  debating cashing out the $9K to pay off debt. I know of that 9k, I'll have 20% federal taxes taken, I would guess like 10% in state taxes (im in MN) and also the 10% penalty for early withdrawal. I'd likely lose about 40% of it, but that would still leave me with me about $5400. Which would pay off my credit card debt (it has 12% interest) and about half of my medical debt. If paying the taxes and the fee are really as far as the ramifications go... it still seems to me like it'd be worth it and money saving in the long run.

I just started a new job and am currently pulling in ~4,000 a month after tax. Combining my rent and other fixed expenses totals around 1,400 a month. My other variable expenses aren't too high relative to what I'm making - I try to watch my spending. I was planning on applying a minimum 1,000 payment to principle each period.

My question is: are there any consolidation strategies out there I may be unaware about? I just ran a pre-qualify through SoFi and their estimate for a 5 year fixed rate is $900 a month at 4.8%.

I'm trying to pay this off as soon as possible to start saving up for a downpayment on a home. Any advice/recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,TFS Goodwill Letter,"* Earlier this year I typed up two goodwill letters addressed to Toyota Financial Services.  One of them for president, Mark Templin and the other for TFS staff in general.

* This was for TFS to remove a 30-day credit marker from February of 2016, where I reached 30 days late on February 4, 2016 for my 2014 Toyota Tacoma account.

* Long story short: I had overpaid for a 2014 Tacoma V6 SR5 4x4 Double Cab 6MT at a San Antonio dealership in November 2013, without negotiating the purchase price and rolling negative equity of $8300 from a 2013 Scion FR-S. (returned the next day to cancel purchase, dealer refused). I was paying $711.40 at about 4.45% APR, due on January 5, 2014 as the first payment and 5th every month.

* I later stupidly bought an expensive used truck (2010 SVT Raptor) to replace it in October 2014, but did not trade it in the Tacoma, expecting to sell it privately. I also put up that new purchase for sale within just 6 weeks of ownership, upon an elder cousin's advice.

* I got to a point where I was regularly 28-29 days late to even manage, starting in the fall of 2015 (TFS granted 2 month relief over summer 2015 TX disasters). 

* By late 2015, I had been trying to sell it privately for 1 year (plus renting it out through Turo) and struggled with inquiries (manual transmission), when another vehicle of mine (Focus ST) got stolen (by a buyer/test drive) in December 2015 (that I had for sale) in Dallas. (long story)

* In order to not spook Ford Credit and dealing with uncooperative Dallas law enforcement, I was forced to keep paying for that other car throughout early 2016 and thus, diverting funds I couldn't. Plus pay a ""ransom"" of $6,200 (fake repair scam to prevent mechanic's lien) to retrieve it.

* Last minute, TFS rejected a payment extension request in early February 2016 and as a result, I was unable to pay them $711.40 before it reached 30 days. With help, I paid them $1,422.80 at the end of February 2016 to avoid repo in March. I paid them another $711.40, paid off the account and sold the truck on April 1, 2016 to Carmax.

* **My problem is, although I politely addressed CEO/President Mark Templin in one letter touting his own accomplishments and explaining my situation, it is very clear that only his administrative staff read it and claimed ""they have to go by the federal credit reporting act or similar"" and that the information is accurate, thus they can't remove it as a goodwill gesture.**

* **Previously in 2017, I tried doing a credit dispute against TFS, which did not work. At this point I'm not sure whether to keep bombarding TFS with reworded Goodwill requests or just give up and wait until 2023.** 

* Out of the many financial problems I've ever had in my 10 year credit history, only TFS (second account) and Confident Financial Solutions account have 30-day markers. The other ones I had with Synchrony on 2 cards (same period of Feb 16), were successfully disputed and removed from all 3 bureaus (although valid).

* I have pointed out to them that for 8.5 months in 2013 I had another account with them before this one which was for my Scion FR-S and paid that account extremely on time (paid due on date). 

* Trading that in for a Tacoma was not something I intended to do in the first place and tried to change my mind last minute (it did not work obviously) upon realizing what the negative equity would cause.

* The dealership convinced me to go home with it for the night (after trying to back out) and then refused to undo the paperwork the next day. I did my best to pay for it over 2.5 years as my primary vehicle, but when I had to keep paying for a stolen car (for sale) that the police deemed a ""civil matter"", I collapsed financially.

* I made very bad choices in assuming I could sell it (Tacoma) for what I owed, AFTER buying another vehicle to replace it BEFORE even selling it off, and then also winding up with 3 vehicles in total I OWED money on for 15.5 to 18 months between October 2014 and April 2016 (bought Focus ST to replace both in 12/2014).

* Considering the circumstances, I'm not sure if I should push on TFS more to do this, as well Confident Financial Solutions (repaired clutch damaged by renter at $2,000) to remove these 30 day markers via goodwill. 

* I cannot blame anyone for my past mistakes, but I've heard about them honoring such requests regarding 60-90 day markers for much more avoidable reasons, compared to 30 days.",finance

personalfinance,Why Should I File Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Instead of Chapter 7?,"When most people think about filing bankruptcy they think about Chapter 7. When it comes to personal bankruptcy, the two most popular and well-known chapters are chapters 7 and 13.

The reason most people think of Chapter 7 when they think of personal bankruptcy is because this is the most common Chapter people use and is well known for their ability to wipe out all unsecured debts with the bankruptcy discharge.

With Chapter 7 there is no repayment, so when an individual gets a bankruptcy discharge, the debt is gone. Over the last few years, many people have used Chapter 7 to eliminate debts that have been caused by lawsuits from deficiencies of unsecured properties.

In this day and age many people have faced foreclosure nationwide and many lenders go after the debtor for the unpaid deficiency.

***There is not one person in America that hasn’t heard about the real estate market meltdown.***

&amp;#x200B;

Since house values have dropped drastically, many folks have been forced to walk from their home because they owed twice as much as it’s worth. But the good news is, filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy will eliminate any liability for the debtor.

In this article we are not here to discuss the benefits of filing Chapter 7, but to show the power of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

Since the financial apocalypse many Americans have been fighting to stay on top of their bills and keep their family home. The lucky ones that are still employed working at a job that pays more than minimum wage, might not need their debts wiped out, but just a little help to get caught up on past mistakes.

When filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy, an individual and their bankruptcy attorney are required to submit to the bankruptcy court a feasible repayment plan that will last 3 to 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Once approved, the bankruptcy trustee will be responsible to collect the payments and pay the Fed according to priority with secured debts being paid first and the unsecured will get what’s left over if any.

At the end of the Chapter 13 payment plan if there is anything left unpaid it will be wiped out the bankruptcy discharge.

This allows an individual that has fallen behind on their mortgage or car payments to use the bankruptcy filing to get caught up. Chapter 13 bankruptcy is king when you want to stop foreclosure and get your finances back on track.

Chapter 13 is not for people who are unemployed and cannot afford to maintain the payment plan. This is one reason why Congress enacted the means test, to force people into Chapter 13 that made more money than the median income of their state.

They believed that people could pay back at least a portion of their debt if they had a substantial income. Some Americans would rather file bankruptcy and pay back some of the debt anyways and this chapter allows them to do so.

***Some people believe that Chapter 13 is not as hard on an individual’s credit as Chapter 7 bankruptcy.***

&amp;#x200B;

Showing an attempt to pay back at least a portion of the debts seems to go a long way with creditors. In today’s real estate market with a high number of foreclosures nationwide, Chapter 13 bankruptcy has become a new benefit for Americans that don’t qualify for any kind of loan modification program.

For an individual that has a HELOC that originally was secured by the property but now that the property’s value has dropped there is no value to secure the loan. The bankruptcy attorney can file a motion with the court to used Chapter 13 for lien stripping and include the second in the bankruptcy discharge.

This will allow the person to possibly be able to keep their home if they can continue making the payment on their first mortgage.Chapter 13 has all the same benefits of a Chapter 7 including the automatic stay.

&amp;#x200B;

It might take longer, but with the right bankruptcy attorney and some hard work, the individual will be on the road to becoming debt-free once again.",finance

personalfinance,Negotiating salary.,"I’m definitely being pre-emotive in this, but I really want to be confident and do the right thing.

I used to work for a contractor that supplies support staff for the client’s store renovations. I’m good at my job, and was exceptionally good for being an employee of that company. I caught the eye of a project manager and ended up working on store renovations almost exclusively for several months.

I got really fed up with the contractor (knew I’d be moving in the nearish future and the inconsistent hours made budgeting impossible) and asked the project manager for a job with the client company. He told me of a posting to apply for and I did and got the job.

My last full year of working as a contractor I made $22,000. I expected to be making around $30,000-$35,000 with this new job. I was offered $40,000 and immediately accepted. I was just so happy to be making almost double and so happy to be made the offer to begin with. I think I was worth that amount then but probably could have negotiated higher.

My contract ends next March and I know I’m much more valuable now. Even 3-4 months after signing this contract I’m worth more than what I make. I’ve grown so much and another project manager has said it’s his responsibility to get me to an even higher level - I have ambitions and they know it.

I really, really like this company and the people I’ve met (very little interactions with HR - two different interviews for 2 different departments and no HR person showed up) so I don’t want to insert foot in mouth. I know that my current contractual situation isn’t a long term goal, but not to sound arrogant, I’m a catch and they’re stupid to get rid of me.

I want to be able to get paid what I’m worth (I’m not trying to rip them off) without being rude or too aggressive. I don’t have those personality traits and I don’t want to be perceived as that kind of person.

If all things go well, I will be running the store level renovations (everything to do with the day-to-day “get it done” will be my responsibility and still be overseen by a manager to deal with operations and logistics). That’s a huge step up from where I started and my pay needs to reflect that. I was thinking maybe $45,000 is fair. But that might be me low balling myself and I am tempted to go as far as $50,000 but a 20% year-over-year salary increase is a lot to ask.

This company is a national company in Canada and has very deep pockets. They have line items in their investor report regarding my area of work that are in the tens of millions. I do have expense perks (meals, certain mileage, plane, hotels) that add tangible value to my salary, but their budgets for those items is multi-millions.",finance

Mine was 708. His was mid 600s. 

He had about $15k of credit card debt at crazy high interest (25%) (yes mistakes were made)

I just took out a student loan of $15k at 10% interest. Still not a great interest rate but better than 25%. We can pay more than interest now on it while we are still in school. 

I previously had a student loan which I was making monthly payments on and was at $12k. 

So now our total Debt on my report is $27.

So in the midst of taking out the loan I got 4 hard pulls, and a new account. 

I logged on the credit karma today and both transunion and Equifax, as well as creditwise from my capital one account ALL jumped up to 730.

personalfinance,USDA Rural 0% Down Loan?,"I am going to be moving to a rural area and would like to use this loan as it is a really nice deal. 0% down and the only mortgage insurance is a 1% fee tacked onto the mortgage at the beginning. Also subsidized interest rate. 

I do have one hangup, I own a house that I rent out (just renewed the lease for a 2nd year July 2019-June 2020. This seems to disqualify me from using the USDA loan.

Could I create an LLC or something and put the house in its name in order to qualify again? If I didn't own this house I would qualify.

Background information on the rental house. The total cost (P&amp;I/escrow/insurance) is $1500 and I charge $1500 for rent. I have about 21% equity in the house and it's total value is around $210-215k. It has appreciated from $189k in Jujly 2016. It is not a USDA Rural loan. I bought it in July 2016 and changed jobs, and decided to rent it out vs taking a bath on selling it. I am happy with the rent I get from it and it is a very low maintenance tenant. Maybe I am renting it for too cheap. It is .7% of the home value which I believe is low. It's a college town so renters are easy to find (not college students though). I will be living about an hour from the house so easy to get to it for any issues they have.

investing,"Lower Interest Rates Don’t Always Mean Higher Stock Prices, Goldman Sachs Warns","The sentiment-driven stock market rally may not have much farther to run, Goldman Sachs says. Slowing growth or political uncertainty could suppress stock valuations, even if interest rates fall.

While Treasury yields could fall further this year, that won’t necessarily help the stock market much, Goldman Sachs says.

Normally, falling interest rates and Treasury yields boost the stock market’s performance. There are two reasons for that: First, U.S. corporate debt yields are linked to those rates, so lower yields usually mean lower interest costs. Second, low returns in safe assets like U.S. debt tend to push investors into riskier securities, including the stock market.

That dynamic may be fueling the stock market’s gains this year. More than 90% of this year’s S&amp;P 500 rally has been driven by rising valuations, not earnings growth, according to a July 1 note from Goldman Sachs equity strategist David Kostin. That essentially means the gains have been driven by sentiment and a lack of other attractive investment options—and not by improvement in corporate fundamentals.

That valuation-driven rally may not have much farther to run, the bank argues. Slowing growth or political uncertainty could suppress stock valuations, even if interest rates fall.

“While lower interest rates benefit equity valuations, the growth outlook has also weakened and uncertainty has risen,” the strategists wrote in a note.

That is why the bank predicts the S&amp;P 500 will rise just 0.6% to 3,000 by year-end, even if the 10-year Treasury yield slides to 1.75% as forecast.

On Wednesday, the benchmark 10-year U.S. yield declined to its lowest point since 2016. It fell as low as 1.94% in morning trade, following the news that International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde has been nominated to lead the European Central Bank. German 10-year government bond yields fell as low as -0.4%, which is the ECB’s current deposit rate.

For investors who are optimistic that low global yields will spur on economic growth, Goldman Sachs recommends stocks in its basket of companies with low labor costs, which includes Western Union (ticker: WU), Cboe Global Markets (CBOE), and Under Armour (UA). Those stocks have lagged behind the broader market, and trade at 15 times next year’s earnings forecasts, compared with the S&amp;P 500’s multiple of 17.

* Since my annual income is &gt;70k, I've read that student loan interest can be deducted up to $2,500, is this helpful to me in anyway?

I was a full time student for a few years but I now have a sustainable income of about $2700 and recently inherited a large sum of money(\~$15,000).

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on using the inheritance to pay off two of my credit cards with the highest interest and part of my 3rd credit card.  This would leave me at $15,000 left on the credit card with the lowest interest rate (12.2%).  

&amp;#x200B;

My monthly expenses:

Utilities - $110

Internet - $55

Cell - $55

Food - $120

Gas - $100

Car insurance - $135

TOTAL = $575

&amp;#x200B;

This leaves me with a decent amount of left over money so I wanted to know what would be a good amount of money to put towards the debt each month?  I realize I should pay as much as I can afford, but what would be the recommended amount to keep in savings?  I have about $3,000 in savings at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the credit cards I have is a 'cash rewards' so is it possible to make payments with the cash rewards card and then pay it off immediately and still receive the rewards?  Or would it just be better to just pay straight from my checkings/savings account?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, my credit score has obviously taken quite a hit and has fallen from around 775 to 615.  My utilization is about 90% right now ($30,000 of $34,000).  I am trying to raise my score as quickly as possible so would you guys recommend getting another credit card to purely lower the utilization percentage?

I'm extending my current lease month by month, and I hate throwing away that money for something that isn't mine at the end.

I have never made a budget before. I came close a few times, but I have some mental blocks regarding it. I have a rough idea of what I spend. I make ~$3600 a month(70k/yr), paid every other week. I spend $740/mo on rent and between $40-80/mo on my phone plan.

I have nearly $17,000, broken up across different accounts (skip to after the dot if you don't care how it's broken up)

$4500 in an investments account, half of that actually invested. The rest I pulled from BYND when it was double what I invested. 

$3000 in a savings account I'd like to keep for emergencies.

$5000 in a checking account doing nothing, but I'll be paying my rent by check so I'll always need $2500 at the start of each month, before my roommates reimburse me. (I'm working on this, I'll try to get paid before the rent is due).

I've got another $4000 in checks I'll finally be cashing this weekend, and ~$5000? in bonds from gifts when I was born.

.

I'm looking at a new car for about $14,000, I might go up to $20,000 and pay it off in installments. My mom says that would help my credit. She also wants to co-sign if it helps lower the interest rate since that will help my credit. Is co-signing something I should be wary of for my credit? I'll definitely pay off whatever I spend on time. 

I also want to go abroad for my masters degree, in 2-3 years time or so. And that makes me hesitant to buy a car, especially if I want to stay out there for 3+ years.

personalfinance,"Saved my first $5,000... Where should I put it?","I know it's not much, but a few months ago I had zero savings at all so I am happy. I am 26 years old and am working my first job out of college. I live with my girlfriend who is also making and saving a moderate amount of money. I've done the math, and I believe I can continue to comfortably put $2,000 into savings per month. My hope is that within a year to two years we will have $60,000 saved between the two of us and be able to get a downpayment for a $250,000 four bedroom home, charge 2-3 of my friends $800 per month in rent each (still less than half of market price for small one bed room apartment in a bad neighborhood in the part of the state where I live), have the rent completely pay for mortgage, as well as generate passive income while I continue to save and put that savings into investments rather than simple savings account. But that's neither here nor there. I am really asking about advise to where to put my savings for the next 1-3 years. Here's why:

​


When I was 18 I opened up a checking account with a local bank. For convenience sake, I opened a savings account with them this year too. As I read the threads on this sub, I realize that my interest rates for my savings account are abysmal. I believe it is actually far less than 1% return. So... what is the most economical place to save my money? I've been reading a lot about online banks with great interest rates, but I was wondering if there were any other short term investments/ places to keep my savings while I save for the house?

One of the reasons why I’m making this post is because this is the first time in my life I’ve been in a good financial situation. I’ve never had family or friends who managed their money properly. Reading finance jargon is as comprehensible to me as reading another language. There are basic things in finance that I do not know or understand but I do want to learn so I can invest my money wisely. But please understand that I plan on retiring by early 40s, so I am not interested in any traditional retirement savings which penalizes early withdrawals, unless the returns on the investments still make the penalized withdrawal profitable.",finance
personalfinance,"Student loan debt is crippling, horrible interest rate, family didn't help me and I'm in over my head.","I'm currently 3/4 years in a biomedical engineering degree from a very expensive college. Because my degree isn't done (despite 8+ years of engineering experience prior to college) #I'm struggling to find a good paying job# [added because I englished hard here]. My mental health is prohibitive to me completing my degree and I don't think I could take on more debt to go back if l wanted to. I'm currently 45k in debt at about 8.75%, and just over 1/4 of my monthly $530 payments are applying to the principal. I'm still trying to just build up my emergency fund but my work only pays ~500/wk before taxes. My car is ~200/mo for the most basic insurance I can get (it was a gift from my boyfriend's gracious family, so no payments). I have been doing the best I can to just save up money but I've gotten into two accidents (neither of which I was at fault) which has drained my emergency funds and made me very stressed about my financial situation even more.

Over tax season I was expecting a 2k tax return because of how much I throw at my loans and taxes in general and then found out that I apparently have a loan through the government I was completely unaware of because my dad ""helped"" me get loans for college and failed to really tell me what the hell was happening. They took the 2k I was going to put into my emergency funds and have been taking about $200 from every paycheck. So as a rundown here

1mo of pay ~2k
Student loan 1: 530/mo
Mystery loan 2: 400/mo
Car insurance: 250/mo
Food/gas: 200/mo
Health insurance: 120/mo
Housing: 0 because my boyfriend is a God
2000-530-400-200-250-120= 500.

I havnt checked my credit but I'm sure it's shit because I've apparently had a loan I had no idea about for nearly 3 years. My parents and I no longer talk and despite my dad being a cosigner on these has not paid a penny. A pretty decent portion of the leftover 500 is taxes and a 401k and I barely make a net 350/mo which goes to random expenses/doctor bills/anxiety/depression meds and whatever else as they happen. Besides finding a better paying job (which I'm doing desperately) how can I make my situation better? I have been trying to find out who the hell is in charge of my mystery loans but every # I have gotten leads to another and the one I *thought* might be right had me pick up to a lady who was like ""how did you even get this #, I don't do anything with that"" and they proceed to transfer me to a line that I have waited up to an hour on hold for with no answer. I don't even know what to start.",finance

personalfinance,"Just graduated college-- no debt, moving out of state for my first job, and has a decent amount of cash sitting in my checking account. Any advice (investing, financial goals, etc.)?","Hi all,

I've just recently in the past few months started looking at my financial future and looking at my options to invest. At the moment I've just been looking at less-risk options like high-interest savings accounts, CD accounts, and possibly even index funds.

My current finances are:

$19k in a checking account

$5k in cash

&amp;#x200B;

I just graduated college with no debt, having attended a four-year university while commuting from home, and we're low-income so state/federal financial aid grants covered all my expenses. I've also been able to save \~85% of my earnings at my current job due to it being reasonably high-paying ($28+/hour after factoring in taxes and tips).

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the thing: my first post-grad job is a 6 month temporary (but possibly permanent) assignment in Hawaii that starts in a few weeks. My rent is $1000/month, and beyond just leisurely expenses and rent, I don't expect to be spending much beyond that. Pay is $22.12/hour, 40+ hours a week. I'm also receiving a lump sum relocation expenses payment of $1500, as well as a $2500 signing bonus. Within four years, if all goes well I expect to earn \~$70-80k salary/year. I also plan on living at my parent's home for at least another 5 years, if my work permits me to stay local.

&amp;#x200B;

My current short/long term financial goals are to save enough money for a 30-40% down payment on a house within 10 years to afford a two bedroom, 1 or 2 bathroom house/condo somewhere in Southern California (I'm currently based near downtown LA). With the two bedroom unit, I also plan on renting out the extra bedroom to help cover mortgage costs. My monkey brain also tells me to want to buy a decent two-door ""sports car"", as I do consider myself an automotive enthusiast and enjoy those kinds of things. Obviously making a $20-30k purchase on a depreciating asset is by far not the best decision to make right after college.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you all have any general advice for me? Are my financial goals a bit too far-reaching? What would you suggest to me, a complete novice when it comes to making investments? Should I stick to low-risk investments for now, and then possibly down the road get into more high-risk options? What resources would you suggest I look into?",finance
personalfinance,"Shopping for a car, looking for a few pieces of advice on the financing.","Hello PF!

I am currently looking to replace my wife’s car. It’s an older ‘06 American made vehicle, and rust has gotten the better of it. We’re looking to buy a 2-3 year old Honda or Subaru, and I plan on this being our only car loan until it’s paid off.

We’re currently shopping for the best deal on True Car, and hopefully find a vehicle nearby. We have another car loan for my vehicle with about $1500 left on it, but we may not be able to wait until it’s paid off to purchase her a replacement. I have a few questions that I need to consider, and any advice/ reasoning would be greatly appreciated!

1) Should I pay off my loan first so the banks see I have less owed or does this not make a difference? We have the money, but would prefer to make the next several payments rather than pay it off immediately if it has no impact on the next purchase.

2) Should I get prequalified for a loan first at a credit union, or do this at the car dealership?

3) Any experience with True Car? They seem like a good source of info. I’ve also been looking into Carvana. Some people seem to love it, others have had bad experiences. Either way I just want to get the best deal. 

4) What are the perks to buying at a local dealership as opposed to one further away? I don’t mind traveling 50-100 miles to get the right deal if it’s a one time thing. 

5) Should I put my wife and myself both on the loan? I have excellent credit (Credit Karma estimates 780-800) and 7+ years of history. My income ranges 55,000 - 65,000. My wife doesn’t work currently, and her credit is estimated between 700-730 on credit karma. I’d like to help her build more credit in case anything ever happens to me. But I also don’t want to pay higher interest rates if I can avoid them.

worldpolitics,FORGIVE ME MY JEWISH BROTHERS AND SISTERS,"# MY PLEA FOR FORGIVENESS FROM THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I want to take this time to apologize for all the hurtful and ignorant stuff I said. I was a 19 year old kid who didn’t know right from left. In no way am I trying to excuse my past statements I can’t take them back I can ask and hope for forgiveness. I was not raised this way, weirdly my parents never spoke to me about the Israel Palestine conflict I just believed everything I seen and was told on the internet, that should tell you I had the mindset of a child at the time. My friend always says we all turn in to rabbis when we get older meaning we get closer to god and are conscience of our mortality. But life experiences shape people. When I look back see all those terrible things I think in No way is that me that’s not what I stand for.

If ever there was a terrorist attack or news on the Taliban or when we started hearing about Isis in the news and me and my family have dealt with discrimination for as long as I can remember and people would be so hateful to us out of fear and judging us without even attempting to communicate with us. We were being stereotyped. They would see what was on the news about radical Muslims and paint us with that same brush. We would go to the Mosque and the Sheikh would give us advice on how to break tensions with everyday people be kind courteous invite people to ask us questions about our faith and are beliefs. To judge us individually with experiences and not the barbaric acts of terrorism you watch on the news. When I was younger and experienced racism I would respond immaturely it’s not until you get older you get the sense you can really be in danger and so can your family. The world changes you. You start to reflect and think about yourself and your own actions. I know I want to be treated and my family to be treated a certain way so how do you do that? You put that attitude back into the world. I was a hypocrite. I attacked a conflict and a people that I feared because I never took the time to educate myself. I knew what I knew, I had bias sources that believed what I believed so I only knew what I believed is the truth. It’s just like people who watch CNN and only CNN and not Fox and vice versa. We can’t really be informed on an issue when your only Always receiving it from one perspective. And as a minority my personal belief is that knowledge is power because there will always be hateful people, or racist people. In an event where I’m approached with hate if I respond with hate ill:

A. be wrong no matter what or

B. make the situation worse and it can become violent.

I lost my ego in my teens. If you’re me and you’re decent you reach across the aisle and educate yourself. Be the change you want in the world.

That’s when I decided I want to Talk to some Israelis at that present time and how they view the current situation I always wanted to know what Israelis thought about the conflict because I’m only seeing one side, and the same story and I’ve had dozens of personal incidents in my life that called for me looking at both sides of the spectrum. That is when I met an Israeli girl name Shira online who was sympathetic to the casualties of children in the Gaza war. I reached out and asked her exact thoughts on what’s happening there and she told me Israelis struggle every day just to be safe in their country... The scariest mind boggling thing I learned was how Israelis have sirens that alert them of incoming missiles from Hamas and have to literally run and hide for their lives. That Israelis want peace as much as the Palestinians, but groups like Hamas that target civilians and encourage others to harm civilians aren’t making the peace process easy. It honestly made me hate myself for sitting their when I was younger in the comfort of Middle Class America speaking on something I knew truly nothing about. I never understood the gravity of what Hamas has done to Gaza and how it’s put the lives of everyone in that space in jeopardy. The people of Gaza are hostages to that terrorist regime. Shira told me how she worked with and around Palestinians who are fed up with the Palestinian leadership and how their divided and Hamas is a literally a terror train and Gaza has basically become its own rogue country in Hamas’s hands. You can imagine my surprise when I was fed information that Hamas was a resistance group fighting for the freedom. Fighting to free Palestine. How could I have known then again people chose to believe what they want. I was naïve.

I just wanted to share this because I miss these guys. I used to work for a wholesale company in Cleveland that sold cigarettes, chips, soda everything. We would be paired up with people to do deliveries to gas stations convenient stores etc. and there were these two funny twin brothers Eddie and Ernie who were like the oracle at the job seasoned and wise. Anyway driving routes on days I worked with them they both would have amazing stories about living and working in Israel and everyday life. They would tell me about having 2-3 jobs working in restaurants as busboys in some, dishwashers in the other whatever they could do to make money they would. They talked about working alongside Palestinians in those restaurants for Jewish owners and that the media covers what sells. That the media sells the hostile environment but they never experienced it. These guys are the people that open you’re your heart and you compare them to your grandparents. Coincidentally this wholesale company In Cleveland is owned By Palestinians, with Jews and Palestinians working together.

A lot of my ignorant statements were made during the 2014 Gaza war and it was off impulse and raw emotion. I didn’t care who I was hurting with my words I just wanted to hurt and that is something I deeply regret. I as a Muslim who has dealt with constant discrimination should know not to generalize a people blame a people collectively. I’ve said a lot of anti-Semitic things that I can’t take back but I can tell you that’s not what I believe. I believe anyone can have redemption, most of what I’ve said was said when I was learning to tie my shoes 18-19. I’m 26 now wiser but still don’t know everything. I hope for another 50 more years to impact this world with love and unity and acceptance.

You look at America now where there’s so much hate to groups of people that they fear because they don’t understand them. If we all took the time to educate ourselves on other people there would be more peace more understanding more acceptance. In a time where white nationalist and Nazi believers are at their strongest and synagogues and mosques are getting attacked Jews and Muslims need each other more than ever. The alt right, KKK, etc. have a voice stronger than ever before. They believe they have the President of the U.S. backing which has made it dangerous for our families to simply go to the grocery store. When I look back at how small I was being to how the world is today and what people are doing to each other today Its almost as if I felt entitled. I got my reality check and the world is getting theirs. There are people out here that want to wipe us off the earth for who we are and what we believe in and that’s why I’m proud to say That I Stand with My Jewish brothers and sisters and Real Christian believers not the ones forming hate groups to attack us.

I’m not the man I was last month last year or 5 years ago. I grow every day and knowledge is power. My ignorance came from being uninformed and immaturity. My hate came as revenge for the worst thing I have ever said was I don’t believe in the holocaust the worst tragedy to every happen in modern day. God forgive me for such stupidity. I can’t imagine what it’s like for people who’ve had families that survived that. I hope and pray you will find it in your hearts to forgive me. Just know that I will defend Israel right to exist, live, laugh, and love Just like any other country or people. With hopes to have ever lasting peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. I will stand with you and for you and no one can divide us unless we let them.

I want to apologize again and I don’t want to downplay what I said because I said some vile things, and done a lot of stupid things going through life figuring it our finding myself. Its experiences like this that can have the best effect on people’s life to effect change. To correct them. I see every day on the internet of people spewing hate young old and no one correcting them. And if they don’t think it’s wrong and it’s not deemed wrong those people stay the way they are, bad and hateful people. I fortunately have clashed with life in experiences with people who made me better. Who opened my heart, gave me love and that’s all I root for these days. Love and acceptance. Thank you for taking the time out to read this. First 19-20 years of my life were crash and burn and the past 6 years going on 50 more is smooth sailing.

Shalom

Sincerely,

personalfinance,First time making a real budget and debt payment plan,"It has taken me a few years to climb in my career to a point where I can actually make a plan for my financial life beyond ""pay everything on time and pray for no surprises"". 

My goal is to aggressively attack my credit card debt while saving some money and enjoying a modest social life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a spreadsheet of my financial situation:  [https://imgur.com/a/adUB9NO](https://imgur.com/a/adUB9NO)

I am very concerned about my $500 monthly food and fun allotment and being able to stick to that but will try my hardest.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have to purchase a vehicle next week.  I have budgeted up to $300 per month for an auto loan and am willing to put up to $2000 down on the vehicle.  I am giving myself a firm $20,000 out the door price limit and ideally want that number closer to $15,000. I expect my APR to be between 4%-6% with my credit score of 708.

Assuming that I do put down the $2,000, then I have $4700 cash in my bank account.  I am considering putting all of that towards my Discover Card.

&amp;#x200B;

**Credit Debt Plan:** 

My debt plan is to avalanche my debt, starting with my Discover Card. After the car purchase I plan to transfer my Discover card balance to a 0% introductory rate card.  Given my experience with this in the past I don't believe I will be approved to transfer the full balance.  So whatever is left over I plan to pay off immediately.  Then do the same on the Capital One card in October, and again with the Citi Card in February 2020.  As long as those cards are at 0% I am comfortable paying the minimum monthly and putting money towards my next highest interest rate, which in this case would be the 6.5% from one of my student loans.  

*Is this a good plan?*

**Savings Plan:**

I have an HSA with my new employer where they contribute $3000 at the beginning of every calendar year without me having to contribute anything. I don't plan to contribute anything additional for the first year or two, even though I know there are tax incentives. I think that money is better off being spent on attacking my credit debt first.  I am in good health and don't have any recurring medical expenses.  

*Thoughts?*

I will be eligible to start on the 401K plan at the beginning of 2021.  The company contributes 10% of your base salary every year, without requiring you to contribute anything.  However I would like to be in a position by that time to contribute.  

I plan to squirrel away 10% of each paycheck into an account for emergencies and vacations and those types of things.  

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a good looking plan?  Would you do anything different?  Did I miss any details?  Thanks!",finance

She said it was to build credit and I never really questioned it (except one time where I asked her about a piece of mail addressed to me saying that a request to increase a credit card balance was declined. She started yelling) but I recently have been second guessing a lot of what she says. 

I went on credit karma and looked at my credit report and saw that as of right now there are 4 accounts open in my name:

Amazon (Responsibility: Individual)- $2,023/$2,100
Navy Fed (Responsibility: Authorized User)- $1,942/$2,000
Capital One (Responsibility: Authorized User)- $843/$850
JPMCB Card (Responsibility: Individual)- $839/$1,200

From what I read on this sub, I would be able to take myself off as an authorized user from the Navy Fed and Capital One accounts pretty easily. What would happen if I did? would it affect my credit or hers?

I'm really worried about the Amazon and JPMCB cards. My mom is a hoarder and has a problem when it comes to buying things online and I guess she's been using that Amazon card to buy a bunch of useless shit (our basement is full of them). I'm a college student and have been living at home this past year, and have noticed that she hasn't been having as much delivered to our house as she used to. Still, I'll be moving across the state next month and don't want to have to worry about this. I didn't even know what JPMCB stood for until I googled it, and I have no idea what she's been using that for. 

I also know that the electricity bill is under my name, but I'm not sure how that affects me. 

I'm almost done with college and want to start off my adult life on the wrong foot, but I feel seriously overwhelmed when I think about this. 

Am I liable to pay off these debts or would I be able to close all of the accounts? I'm living at home until next month so I'm not sure what kind of affect that would have on our already strained relationship but I don't want to be cleaning up her mess in the future.",finance

personalfinance,"IF the fed does cut rates, would we be better off waiting for a refi loan?","Some are saying 2 rate cuts or more.  IF we assume two rate cuts, based on history, what change can we expect on ReFi loan rates?

In the past, IIRC, the ReFi rates didn't always follow.  IIRC, it was the Fed buying of debt that caused the most movement.  This was after the 2008 crash, I remember several times when there would be a cut and no drop in home loan rates.  I might be wrong on this, maybe someone follows this pretty close.",finance

personalfinance,"Account About To Be Sent To Collections, What Are My Options?","I'm a little at a loss on what to do in this situation.

Back in May, I decided to switch from ATT postpaid plan to a prepaid one. Somewhere along the lines, something got messed up. Apparently, they had been continuing to charge me for data even though the original postpaid account should have been closed. Now I have a bill of $1200 that I have no idea how to pay. I have tried contacting them since I first got notification about the bill, but I have just been getting the run around ever since then. I got a letter in the mail that I'm on my final notice and that the account would be sent to collections fairly soon. They keep telling me that the charges are valid and that there is basically no way of reversing them, so I guess I'm going to have to figure out some way of paying it even though I never got any notice or bill that I was still being charged after I switched my account to prepaid.

I've been working on increasing my credit score as of late and have been doing fairly well, getting it to almost 700. And I've heard that collections can seriously ruin that and any decent chances at a good score. I'm 23 and will be graduating college in two more years, so I don't want something major that would affect my chances in the future. I stumbled upon LendingClub while browsing CreditKarma and was wondering if a personal loan is a good route to take instead of maxing out the pair of credit cards that I do have.

I'm 23, I bring in about $1000 a month. I have car payments at $230 (about $7000 remaining on the loan) and a phone bill at $60. I suppose I could also use the loan to pay off my remaining credit card debt &lt;$1500 too, but I'm not really sure what is a good route to take. I bank with Wells Fargo and Navy Fed (prior military) if either of those provides better loan options.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Edit: [Link to the bill](https://imgur.com/rafZjcK) The $1200 comes from the return check fee since I put a stoppage on it from my bank as well as a late fee.",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,What to do with a lump sum of money?,"Hi there, im in a bit of an unusual situation in the fact that I have just  come into a sizable sum of money (about 15 grand) and I don't really know what to do. 

A bit of background about myself:

I have just finished my first year of university and am swiftly moving onto the next (studying in the UK). I have a summer job paying £8.21 an hour and a term time job paying a similar wage. Between this and my 4500 pound annual  maintenance loan I can take care of myself for the year. This does mean between my school fees and maintenance loan fees I am accumulating a debt of just of over 13k a year with an interest rate of about 6%. I also have access to a £1000 overdraft which has no interest for a year, not something I particularly need to use at the moment. 

I have no other significant financial barriers in my life at the moment. 

My plan 

I was originally going to put it into a savings account and an ISA but they all have crap interest rates. My current idea is to set aside a grand for any expenses that might suddenly crop up. Just leave this in a savings account taking the crap interest rate but its money that I can access at a moments notice. I was also going to put about 13 grand into a HSBC investment account, choose 6 funds and put just over 2 grand in each and watch it grow. As for the remaining grand I was going to create a standing order to put 250 pound into what HSBC call their regular saver. I can put up to 250 a month into it and im not allowed to touch it. At the end of the year they will give me 3% on what ever is in the regular saver. This obviously only gives me 4 months of run way but between birthdays christmas's,overtime,holiday pay and any money I can take out of my investment account I can cover the other 2 grand. I was also thinking the interest from this could offset any losses which might result from a bad performance of  a fund.

&amp;#x200B;

As to why im not paying off my debt. The student debt Only needs to be paid back once I make more than 27k a year. Also its more like a tax as any thing I make over 27k will be ""taxed"" at 9% (I think its 9). Not only this but the money I believe can be better spent. It can be used to cover rent for the year or used to put a deposit down on a house or buy me a car so I can commute to work. All of this gives me ""better earnings potential"" than simply paying the debt

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound like a reasonable plan and do you have any other suggestions. 

Thank you

personalfinance,Estranged uncle spent all his retirement savings - help,"Throwaway account… Need help with retired family member’s finances who is claiming they’re now destitute. Something seems fishy to me, and I need pointers on what advice to give.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finance Breakdown:**

* State of Residence: NJ
* Family Member Age: 70 (never married, no children, retired at the age of 42 in the early 90s, had inheritance from my grandmother/great aunt to live on in addition to a pension and IRA) 

**Income:** 

* $26,000 annually from social security and his pension
* Said he made $160,000 from the sale of his townhouse in 2014 (when he moved into the apartment he’s currently living in) – said he put it into his investment account, withdrew about $45,000 from it annually, and it is now gone.
* Claiming an IRA and investment account are now tapped. In 2009 or 2010, I had spoken with him and his financial advisor was present, who mentioned that there was about $1,000,000 in his investment account alone (not including social security/pension or even his IRA I don’t think) – this is what seems really fishy to me? Wouldn’t he need to be drawing something like $100k+ annually to drain that entirely by now??   


Important to note that he doesn’t make any of his own investment choices, and his financial advisor who manages his portfolio is a fiduciary advisor who has been in business for decades (the firm also handled my grandparent’s money, and also my tiny IRA)… I don’t see them making risky investments, and I thought the market had been doing well the past few years?

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses (Annual):**

* No credit card, car, or other debt.
* Rent: $24,780
* Food: $7,500
* Prescriptions: $7,200
* Country Club: $4,000
* Federal &amp; State Taxes: $3,000
* Medicare Gap Coverage: $2,784
* Tax Installment Payment (for a past IRA withdrawal): $1,800
* Medicare: $1,608
* Electric: $1,500
* Cable/Phone: $1,500
* Car Insurance: $1,400
* Investment Portfolio Management Fee: $1,000
* Medicare Part D Coverage: $897.60
* Gas (Car): $800
* Gas (Utility): $500
* Laundry / Dry Cleaning: $500
* Tax Preparation: $300
* Renter's Insurance: $125
* Apartment Maintenance Crew Gratuity: $120
* Oil Changes (Car): $100
* Car Registration: $40  


**Total: $61,454.60**

  

**My Advice Plan:**

He’s asking me to make up the difference between what he spends per year and what he makes off social security/pension per year. There’s no fucking way that’s happening. He literally spends about twice what I spend in a year (I live in a HCOL area), I just paid off my last student loan this year, finally saved up an emergency fund in 2018, and was able to contribute to my own IRA for the first time in 2018. I will have no pension, I’m 10 years behind on retirement savings, and graduated college during the recession. I make okay, steady money, but I’m not a fucking millionaire (I make less than $100k per year). Even just the fact that he thinks I could somehow manage that is enraging to me and shows how out-of-touch with reality he is…

But, I’m going to offer advice:

* He already acquiesced that he has to cut his country club membership. He doesn’t play golf, he doesn’t play tennis, he literally was paying this club thousands of dollars per year to be able to hang out there and for nostalgia. FFS…
* He has to move, he says is lease is up in August. I’m going to tell him to look for places that are no more than 25 – 30% of his annual income…But I’m almost wondering if that should be even lower?
* I’m thinking I’m going to recommend he move out of NJ. It’s a really expensive state to live in, and while he grew up in NJ, he has no family left there. I was thinking of recommending states like North Carolina or Tennessee which I think are cheaper in both taxes and cost of living?
* I’m going to tell him to stop giving gratuities to people if he can’t afford to support himself.
* I’m going to tell him that he has to drastically reduce his food budget. He eats out every meal. His food budget is insane.
* He needs to stop buying clothes that need to be dry cleaned and start doing his own laundry.
* I think he should consider getting a part-time job – I know this will go over about as well as a lead balloon. He hasn’t worked at all since the early 90s, has never used a computer, and refuses to learn.  
   
 

**My questions:**

* Do pensions or social security “run out?” Does he need to worry that those sources of income will go away?
* What's a good target for housing per month? Is 25 - 30% of his income still okay in his situation or lower?
* Are pensions and social security taxed? If he lives in an apartment and doesn’t work, WTF is he paying federal and state taxes on?
* Is there a way to reduce any of his medical expenses? Does he actually need Medicare Part D and Gap coverage? He says the prescriptions he takes that can be generic already are, so I don’t know that there’s a way to reduce the cost of his prescriptions… He’s diabetic, obese, and has severe arthritis, those are the health issues I know about.
* Does he really need renter’s insurance, or is it a rip-off? 
* Any other advice I can give him? Any other resources that might be available for seniors for housing/help with finding a small job/budgeting?
* Am I right that something else happened here to drain his investment/IRA like that? He's saying it's just the annual expenses listed, plus a used car purchase a couple years back when his old car died and some dentistry work last year (totaling $3,000). Is there more to this story?   


**Backstory:** 

I (currently 32 years old) was just contacted by an estranged uncle (he’s now 70). I haven’t heard from him in 6 years. We didn’t see each other much when I was growing up, maybe once a year. We were close when I was in college and for a couple years after graduating, but he stopped speaking to me when I refused to take up financially supporting my mother after my father divorced her and got remarried (they’d lived separately since I was 5 but my dad had been paying her essentially non-court ordered alimony since they separated, the new wife – logically enough – said that had to stop). My mother’s a long story… She has a lot of mental health/substance abuse issues, and not only was I in a mountain of student loan debt but honestly, she was a fucking shitty mother, and I refused to threaten my financial security to enable her. My uncle’s view was that she was my family and I needed to make the payments to her that my father was stopping… He wanted me to give her about $14,000 a year, essentially for the rest of her life. Even if I’d wanted to, I wouldn’t have been able to make those payments.  


So, anyway… My uncle retired in 1991 when he was 42. He was a senior VP at an investment bank in NYC, and they offered him early retirement with a pension in lieu of a lay-off. Instead of getting another job, he took care of my elderly great aunt and grandmother until they passed away (great aunt passed in 1998, grandmother in 2001). He inherited a fair sum from both of them and lived off that rather than returning to work (no idea what the actual amount was…).   
 

He has no children and never got married. He was averse to owning property for some reason, and rented for the majority of his life. He did eventually buy a townhouse in NJ, but sold in 2014 and moved in to another apartment. He said he made about $160,000 from the sale of his townhouse, but that’s gone. He never travels.  


I’m not heartless, but the situation makes me really angry. Just that he could be asking me for this large amount of support and thinking that I’d actually have it to give, like there’s no comprehension how insane of an ask this is of anyone, let alone someone he hasn’t been willing to speak to for 6 years… But, that's all aside the point now, I guess.",finance

personalfinance,I jumped tax brackets—will I face a penalty come tax season because I owe so much?,"Hey guys!

I only worked during the latter half of 2018, and will be working most of 2019 at a much higher income. As a result, my income will rise from **$35k in 2018** to **$100k in 2019**. I live in CA, so my taxes will go from 21% (fed + state) to 33%.

I've claimed zero allowances and my new employer is currently withholding at last year's full rate (21%). This means that, come tax season, I'll owe a shit ton of cash to the government. :(

Some questions:

1.) I'm guessing .33-.21 = .12 x 100,000 = $12,000 likely owed. Is this the correct amount I should put aside?

2.) Is there any way to have more withheld, or do I just have to wait until next year?

**3.) My biggest concern: I'm not too familiar with tax penalties, but I get the impression that having more than a few grand owed means you're paying an extra fee on top of that. Will I get penalized for owing so much?**

I only worked 2 out of 5 days (I'm an hourly W2 employee) and so my income was 40% of what it is normally. That explains why my tax cut was so low—I was thinking that taxes were calculated based on projected annual income and not by paycheck. I feel like an idiot now. Thanks everyone!",finance

personalfinance,"22, in debt, need advice.","TL;DR at the bottom. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read through this, and any advice you have.

I didn't learn how to be responsible with money when I started making it. I spent my paychecks as a teen on gas, food, and stupid things I didn't need with no one to keep me in check. Also, I live in a rural area with no businesses within walking/biking distance and on a lot of hills. A car is a necessity where I live.

I worked fast food part-time for a few months as my first job. Only a small amount of credit card debt as on my mom's advice I opened an account to start building credit history. Long story short, the heat of the kitchen led to emergency room visits which led to finding out I have a heart condition. I had to leave the job for that reason, and decided to start college after I found a job working at a local shop.

Half a semester into college riding 100% on student loans as I only made about $80/week, I wrecked my car by hitting a dead animal at night. I lost traction and slid into a ditch. Liability insurance, so I was broke with no transport. This was the day after my birthday, so my brother stayed in town with me and my family for several weeks, taking me to and from school and work, and helping me figure out my car situation. A friend of his came through and allowed me to make payments on a cheap SUV they had.

That vehicle ended up costing a lot of money to keep running. Halfway through my second semester, I was too broke to get to school every day. I didn't have any gas or money and the SUV was leaking just about every fluid it could and running rough. After my grades dropped and my teachers could not help me, I applied for a hardship withdrawal. It was denied. I appealed and provided all of the evidence I could, but it was denied again. Therefore I still owed the full amount of the student loans. I picked up another job and started saving to replace the SUV. When I got the money together, I got another car and sold the SUV. The store I worked at closed, and I went back to the local shop I worked at before, back to $80/week. Around this time my dog got pneumonia and it cost over $1,000 to treat him.

A month into owning that vehicle and bring surprised with a suddenly failed crankshaft pulley and fuel pump, I was T-boned. The guy was speeding around a corner and pulled into the right-turn lane I was making a left through just in time to hit me so hard the car flipped over. No cameras, no proof of speed or where he was, only that I was making a left turn. All fault on me, no money to recover from insurance. Broke and carless.

A couple of months later, selling everything of value I could, saving every penny I could make, my brother comes through for me again. He gave me his old car just in time for me to land a good full-time job making a decent amount of money. I spent some of the money fixing the car up, as it had several minor mechanical issues. I spent another chunk of that being stupid becauze I felt like I deserved it. Then the car broke down and I ended up getting another credit card just to pay for the repairs. Fast forward 3 months of using most of my income to pay down debts, and they decide they didn't need me there anymore. I was devastated, but got right on to the job hunt and had a new job in 2 weeks. Only part time but with the intent to go full after training. Turns out I was only bridging a gap while they were short-staffed and working on cross-training to save money. I found email evidence of that but decided I'd try to work really hard and prove my worth. It didn't work and I lost that job.

 It took almost 2 months and hundreds of applications to get a new job. In the meantime I lived as frugally as possible, I hardly ever went out, but I still had to eat and get myself basic needs. I used my credit cards for that and my money on paying the credit card bill. I finally got a job, and it turned out to be a ""1099"" position, but they only did it that way to avoid paying taxes. Three weeks in, my car spins a crankshaft bearing and the engine was ruined. The repairs were too expensive, and the consensus was that I needed to sell and replace it. Well, I sold it. And despite having a ride to my job for every scheduled shift I had, my boss fired me because it created ""reliability issues"". 

So my income stopped suddenly and now I'm stuck without much money, a car, no way to get a loan, and debt drowning me. I don't have any friends or family that can/will put a loan in their name, or loan me money personally. I've sold almost every item of value I have. I spend every day looking for cars and trying to make something work. I want to be more responsible with my money and NEVER have to go through crap like this again. I'm miserable every day and feel hopeless. I'm done being stupid and spending it on junk. Lesson learned. I'm roughly $20K in debt between student loans, hospital bills, and credit cards.

TL;DR - I was dumb and also some bad things happened and now I'm broke, in debt, jobless and carless. I don't know what to do and I'm desperate.",finance

personalfinance,Buying a house : Using inheritance or taking out a mortgage to buy the house and invest the inheritance ?,"Hello,

I’m single, work full time and don’t have any big expenses. I have enough money at the end of month to save and my employer pays for my car( lease, gas, taxes, insurance) 

I recently inherited some money and have about 375k € in a savings account. I currently live with a friend but I’m looking to buy an apartment, costing about 350k €. In my European country there is usually about a 5 month period between the agreement of purchase and the actual payment. This means that if i find the apartment of my dreams tomorrow, I’d still have 5 months were the money sits idly on my savings account. 

I had a call with my banker because I hate seeing that amount of money on a savings account when the interest rate is lower than inflation. 

He tried to convince me that it would be smart to invest a portion for 20 years ( lets say 100k €) and keep the rest on the savings account. When it would be time to pay for the apartment I would use my savings and supplement with a mortgage with a fixed rate. Since an investment on 20 years would have a higher return than the cost of my mortgage I would be making money. 
It would also be smarter as it would diversify my money. 

Does lending money to invest make sense? Does “free” money exist?

Made a throwaway account as I am embarrassed to be in this position, but through therapy have found strength to ask for advice.

I am 27 and in desperate need of guidance after a decade of bad habits. I quit my job 2 months ago without another lined up as it was becoming toxic, abusive, and critically endangering my mental health stability. I applied for unemployment and am still in that process (have my interview next week). I also signed up with my city's job center and am actively applying. I was passively job hunting since the beginning of the year, and now it is all engines running.

I am committed to doing better and need help formulating an attack plan for the next, well lifetime, until I battle my way out of debt

*Here are my monthly expenditures*:

* Rent, $1200, Los Angeles
* Renter's insurance, $7 (required for my building)
* Gym, $15
* Food, $150
* Transit, $100 (unlimited metro pass)
* Internet, $50.99
* Cellphone, $30
* Electricity, $300 (billed every 2months)
* Therapy, $280 ($70 a week, no health insurance right now)

and then my loans/credit cards

* Private loan: $16,000 ; 6% interest
* Chase credit card: $4,000 ; 25.99%
* Capital One: $12,400 ; 22.05%
* American Express: $10,840 ; 21%
* Student Fed Loans: $36,800 ; deferment 

I know without stable income as a guide, it might be hard to get advice. But I want a plan of attack to work on now as I eventually start bringing in more money.

More details: Currently live in a studio. I do not have family to ask for help, they kicked me out when I was 17. I don't have close friends and of the ones I know by name, we are all pretty much struggling. My last job I was making $33k. Credit score is 580, I racked up a lot of credit card debt being young, dumb and vulnerable to people who took me in, not going to beat myself up over it further. I am relatively in a much better place now mentally and want to work on getting the rest of my life stable. 

I paid July's rent and the rest of my bills earlier this week and that officially brought my checking and savings account balance to $0. I am applying to everything like I said earlier and earlier today submitted my information to start delivering food for PostMates and Uber on my bike.

Please give me all the advice you have and tips. It is not an excuse, but I never had proper guidance on how to make responsible healthy choices. I put in the work in therapy, and am ready to put in the work now to handle and attack this. I will research and learn on my own as well starting with this sub's wiki. 

If anyone has been in a similar life situation, I would love to hear advice and experience.

If you need more information I am happy to answer questions, new to this so appreciate it all, thanks.

personalfinance,Question on Cash Out Refinance Mortgage,"Hi everyone, looks like there are several posts like these already, but not one that meets my specific example! I own a home worth $400,000 and I have a mortgage with about $186,000 left to pay down. I purchased the home in 2018. I'm thinking of doing a refinance to a cash out mortgage, and pulling out around $100,000 to $120,000 in equity. My salary is $85k, and I'm single. The main goals for this would be to: 

1. Cash to to do some remodeling (\~$20k)
2. Pay off car loan (\~$21k)
3. Have a nest egg of cash for future home costs (\~$15k)
4. I may be relocating for work (East coast to West Coast), so I would prefer not to sell my house but rent it out. The rest of the cash would be used for relocation, and additional savings/expenses. West Coast is a lot more expensive than where I live on the East Coast. I would be expecting to have a salary of $120k if I relocate (Silicon Valley area). I might invest the remainder in an index fund to make sure that \~$50k is not just sitting there

&amp;#x200B;

Currently my mortgage is $1479. This includes the Principal and interest, property tax, and property insurance. The only other debt I have is $452 per month for my car note. I bring home about $5,027 in income after taxes a month. My interest rate at the moment is 4.625%. Credit score is 740 to 760, depending on who you ask.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've seen there are some lenders (like [better.com](https://better.com)) that are offering cash out refinancing mortgage rates of around 4% to 4.1%. So doing this would lower my interest rate. From [Better.com](https://Better.com), pulling out that much cash would raise my total mortgage payment (PMI, tax, and insurance) to $1920. That increase would be offset by paying off my car. 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, I'm wanting to know if I have a good use case for doing a cash out refinance mortgage? I have a few expenses I'd like to embark on, and the possibility of moving is making me nervous about the amount of cash on hand I have right now. Currently, savings + checking = $3000. That doesn't include any retirement savings.

investing,An argument for owning junior gold miners heading into the tail-end of the economic cycle,"With ‘whatever it takes’ becoming the global central bank motto after Powell’s conciliatory December speech, most arguments against owning gold have evaporated. “It generates no cash flow” becomes significantly more appealing as real yields on large portions of the global bond market enter negative territory, with the US seemingly trending towards the zero lower bound.

&amp;nbsp;

I understand this is a relatively contrarian opinion on here, but the market is not yet pricing in enough cuts into 2021. While the short-end of the curve may whipsaw due to trade developments, it will end decidedly lower without moving higher again this cycle. Let me repeat that: the Federal Reserve will not raise rates or tighten again this cycle. December was both a policy error and proof that a.) rate increases are intolerable given the amount of outstanding debt ex households b.) the world is awash in dollar denominated debt and decreasing overseas liquidity will crush global economic activity.

&amp;nbsp;

Let me point out that the equity market seems to be the only thing anyone on this subreddit focuses on, however it’s also the least relevant capital market. The bond market is *screaming* that a policy error has occurred, and the bond market typically ends up being correct. Does that mean stocks have to come plummeting to earth? Hardly. In fact, given rhetoric around the globe it has obviously become a mandate of the global monetary authorities to continue the economic expansion at all costs. The why is more difficult, but my personal opinion is that another global economic recession has been deemed untenable given the worldwide rise of populism since 2008. People are angry about their circumstances, angry about inequality, and although paradoxically a recession tends to decrease inequality, it would also lead to a drastic rise in populism and discontent.

&amp;nbsp;

Conventional wisdom is that the central banks are out of ammunition; they aren’t. A few things have changed:

a.) Central banks are quite blatantly working in concert and coordinating policy responses.

b.) Globalization means that barring capital controls interest rates should trend together barring outliers (eg Venezuela). US govt credit is the last risk-free asset with a reasonable yield, and it appears to be the last domino to fall.

c.) QE was a paradigm shift. If an authority controls the money supply and is willing to perform OMOs on any asset class, they can without a doubt support prices within that asset class. Could equities be next? Japan has blazed the path in monetary policy and ETF purchases are where they are presently at. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, do I believe central bankers can prevent a deflationary bust or global economic slowdown akin to 2008? If you had asked me ten years ago I would have referenced ‘this time is different’ in jest. Today, I’m not so sure. I’m confident that they could prevent a credit crunch and bust in asset prices a la 2008 *if* policy is coordinated on a global scale. The question now seems to be whether they should. Recessions often entail creative destruction and the loss of jobs whereas Japan has shown that perpetually depressed rates (eg no hurdle rate) can lead to zombie companies and potentially lower growth going forward. There’s obviously way more to it than that, but this post is getting long and I haven’t even talked about gold miners yet. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, why should one own some form of gold? When it’s clear that a slowdown is ahead, central banks around the globe are going to go further negative and ease like the status quo depends on it, because it does. Presently almost every leading indicator I follow is showing a slowdown in global economic activity, and while it may not presage a recession, the stark policy pivot we’ve seen from *every* major central bank across the globe is what people should be paying attention to.

&amp;nbsp;

You might ask, why not own bonds then? Why *junior* gold miners instead of the physical metal? I’ll start with the first. There’s a few reasons why bonds seem less appealing than gold on a forward looking basis. I’d argue that the biggest predictor of bond returns on a forward-looking basis is starting yield, but that’s largely irrelevant when most simply want a portfolio hedge. Well, I’ve got good news for you, why do bonds go up in a recession? Because yields go down. So if you presently own Treasuries as a hedge you’re essentially betting that yields will approach and potentially go below zero in the event of a slowdown. Well let me tell you, regardless of economic conditions the smart money will flock to gold when there’s no longer an opportunity cost to holding it over risk-free assets, and that happens when real interest rates approach zero. If you don’t see a use case for a metal that has historically acted as a store of value (over time), compared to a currency that’s been around for ~300 years, is engineered to be inflationary and is currently priced to lose money over time, then I’m not sure what to tell you. The only case in which treasuries or sovereigns will make money is a case in which junior gold miners will almost assuredly make more money.

&amp;nbsp;

And finally, why junior gold miners instead of gold? Well, it’s simple really: gold isn’t an asset that produces cash flows so I’m using it largely as a hedge. Instead of holding 40% bonds I’m sitting at around 10% GDXJ and 7.5% other miners that exhibit a sort of optionality in relation to gold price; the miners have low debt &amp; expenses with a cost of production well above the current price of gold, so they act in a sense as an OTM call on gold, have a low cost of carry and lower bankruptcy risk than the index. 

&amp;nbsp;

Alright, that’s the end of the line for me. I’ve spent too much time writing this and if I add much else it’ll become even more convoluted.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: Wanted to add a few more things. Although I find it to be exceedingly unlikely, on the off chance of some inflationary shock gold would significantly outperform bonds, even in a rising rate environment. The big downside risk is that the economy is wonderful and Powell raises rates, in which case hopefully the extra equity exposure as opposed to owning bonds would make up for some of the difference. I also think gold miners are generally a terrible investment and that this is a special situation given the current macro &amp; monetary environment. I do not plan to hold miners and rebalance for years, if my thesis plays out I’ll begin paring my position as rates (FFR) approach 0. Don’t be surprised to see a short-term reversal going into the July Fed meeting. IMO many headwinds for gold will abate as it becomes more obvious that this slowdown in global leading indicators likely isn’t transient or entirely related to the trade war.",finance

I currently have about 10 months left on my current auto loan and after having a child thought it would be a good idea to move up from a sedan to a minivan or SUV.  I was approved for up to 15k for a auto loan through my current credit union.  The understanding I have after talking to them and researching the details of the loan is that it is a blank check that can be taken to a dealership and I can write it up to the 15k amount.  The only restrictions that we're given to me is that the car couldn't be older than a 2013 and must have 75k miles or less.

After researching I found a decent car that I could afford.  I went to the dealership and let them know how much was left on my current loan and they said they could just roll it over into the price of the car and they would pay it off.  According to the dealer I wouldn't have to pickup the check that my credit union sent because they could work with them and just do everything today.  After about an hour they said that the loan my only covers the cars value and tax, tags, etc.  They basically said to use this loan I would have to put down the costs of my current loan.

The dealership was very accommodating and never really offed to do the loan themselves but the whole situation seems weird to me.  The restriction of the loan not covering the amount of my previous loan was never mentioned by the credit union.  Is this just an attempt to get me to do the loan through the dealership or is there some risk that my credit union takes on if the dealership pays off my current loan that I'm not aware of.

personalfinance,GAP Coverage Refund Not Received for Car,"Hi! So my mom bought and partially financed a new car with GAP coverage but changed the lien holder relatively recently in March because we were able to get a slightly lower interest rate. Because the loan was transferred from Chase Auto (old lien holder) to TDECU (current lien holder), we got a letter from Chase saying that ""the recent payoff included a credit for the unused portion of the financed insurance/ or GAP product"" of around $700. According to the letter, we ""received a credit because you paid off your account early which canceled this product.""

&amp;#x200B;

I called the Chase Auto Finance recently to ask them about the credit because we only received $18 and they claimed that we only receive a portion of the credit and they keep the rest which doesn't make sense to me at all. Shouldn't we receive the entire $700 in credit since the entire loan has been transferred to the other lien holder? Thank you!",finance
investing,Margin trading vs leveraged ETF,"Which would be a better choice for long term buy and hold: 

1. Margin trading ETF (IVV) at 2x leverage at 3.8% interest rate (Interactive Brokers)
2. Buying the equivalent 2x leveraged ETF (SSO)

The 10-year trailing return of IVV is 14.62%, so option 1 would have yielded me 14.62\*2-3.8 = 25.44%, while the 10-year trailing return of SSO is 26.17%, so it seems like the leveraged ETF is a better option (no risk of margin call too).

personalfinance,Dealership might have submitted my income incorrectly,"On July 1st, I agreed to purchase a new car from the dealership and filled out the handwritten credit application with $8,000 monthly income.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 2nd, I bring a cashier's check for the down payment. With the cashier's check and trade-in, around 20% of the total cost of the purchase is financed. I was told by the finance manager that 2 out of the 3 banks declined to provide finance due to high debt-to-income ratio. I sign the paperwork and drive off with the car.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 4th, I noticed on the copy of the typed credit application has my income as $8,000 yearly income. I contact my salesperson for a copy of the handwritten credit application and was told that the accounting office was not available that day. On July 5th, I called the salesperson back and was that they don't have a copy of the handwritten credit application. I was forwarded to the finance manager and was told that they were certain that the income was submitted to the banks as $8,000 monthly. I decide to call the bank loan underwriter that finalize the loan and was told that the dealership actually submitted the income as $800 monthly. They knew the loan would not get approved so without contacting the dealership to verify they assumed it was an error and added an extra zero at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

The interest rate on the loan is higher than any of my previous auto loans and the finance manager also extended the term of the loan to get a lower interest rate. I decided to get the payoff details and closed the loan to stop accruing $6 interest each day.

&amp;#x200B;

Can I get a copy of the credit application with the information that was actually submitted to the 3 banks? I prefer to verify the information that the finance manager sent to the banks than to just trust that they did. I will be meeting with the finance manager in person to figure out how this even happened. The copy of the credit application that the finance manager gave to me does not match what they said and I would like to know if the two other banks that declined due to ""High debt-to-income ratio"" did receive the income as $800 monthly and did not fix the error and added a zero at the end of the income. I have never missed any payments. They use a software called ""RouteOne"" that I am assuming sends the same credit application to all the banks. Honestly, this would not have been an issue if the copy of the credit application matched what I wrote on the handwritten credit application.",finance

personalfinance,Does my budget for graduate school make sense (am I spending too much on an apartment?),"So this is my first post on Personal Finance, although I’ve been an avid reader of this sub for quite some time.  The wiki and general wisdom floating around here has really helped me learn to manage my finances over the past few years since graduating college and entering the working world.

For the past three years I’ve lived in the same apartment, and worked the same job, living off an annual salary which I was payed monthly, and thus budgeting was quite easy. By following some of the general rules regarding what you should spend on housing, transportation, savings, etc. (and applying it to my situation I really got my budget down to a very precise science).

I am now about to begin a masters program, and am not exactly sure how some of the standard advice applies to graduate students. I’ve made a budget for the next year (although there are still a few unknowns), and was hoping someone here could give it a quick look and tell me if there’s anything obvious that I’m doing wrong. My biggest worry is housing (by extension utilities as well) as I’ve said in the title, because I’m worried that I’m spending too much here.


My current debts, assets, etc:

Emergency Fund: $5,000 (roughly 3 months)
Foreign Pension Fund: $8,000 (I can withdraw this penalty free, and will do so soon and place it somewhere in the US, possibly an IRA)
Checking Account: $2,000 

Federal Student Loan Debt: $60,000 (Interest at an average of 5.8%.  From undergrad. I did not make the best choices as an undergraduate, and knowing what I know now probably could have escaped with far less debt, but what’s done is done and I’m left with this horrible number..)

Credit Score: ~ 700



Monthly Income (once beginning graduate school), post tax:

Total: $1,600

Graduate Stipend: $600 (this comes with full tuition waiver as well)

Graduate Stafford Loans: $600 (I plan on taking $7,200 a year in loans, although I’m feeling if possible I should reduce this number..

Freelance/part time work: $400 (I do some stuff online (teaching English, freelance translation) for some extra money. I could theoretically increase this number but I want to focus on my studies..)

Monthly Expenses: 

Total: $1,585

Rent: $550 (a great one bedroom apartment. I have not yet signed the lease though, still deciding..)

Electric: $100 (this is a pretty rough estimate, maybe high)

Water: $30

Internet: $70

Phone: $60

Transportation: $50 (I won’t own a car. I’ll primarily bike but will occasionally need to take buses).

Health Insurance: $240

Groceries: $150 (sort of a rough estimate, as I’m not too familiar with prices in this city. For better or worse though, I eat more than almost anyone I know)

Gym: $15 (great gym on campus)

Fun money: $100 

Savings: $150 

Vacation Fund: $50

Miscellaneous: $20


So my main concern is housing. I’m really happy with the apartment I’ve found, but realistically if I had roommates I could be living a lot cheaper and reduce the amount of loans I’m currently taking. For example, i have the opportunity to live in a 4 bedroom house with three other people and pay $350 a month, with all utilities included. That would save me nearly $5,000 a year... those kind of savings are hard to turn down, especially when I’m taking out $7,000 per year in loans. That said though, I had roommates in college and it was fun, but I’ve been living alone for the past three years and I love it so, so much and I think it would really impact my quality of life and ability to work effectively if I lived with multiple roommates. I realize that sounds a bit pampered, but sort of just how I feel.. 

A couple additional points: I’ll be graduating with $75,000 in debt if I take out the loans I’m planning on. I should get a job post graduation making $55,000-$65,000. Within 5 years I should be making around $85,000 and by the ten year mark there’s a lot of variance.. I could still be hovering around the $85,000 mark but could also very well be making much more than that (150,000+?).  I’m 27 years old. Did a lot of screwing around in college and got a bit of a late start to adulting.

personalfinance,"Recently divorced mom of 4, need help with financial planning","I'm middle aged and newly single after being a SAHM for many years. At the time we separated I had no recent substantial work experience. I've never worked full time in my life, due to serious chronic health issues and being a SAHM. 

I have no college degree, but have a bunch of college credits from unaccredited institutions earned 20-25 years ago. I've been taking a few classes at a local community college to fill in some gaps, take care of prerequisites, and gain skills such as learning more about Microsoft Office Suite while trying to figure out what to do. The community college won't accept many of my credits, so I'm applying to a few other institutions that may accept more of them so that I could complete a degree faster. 

What to get a degree in is a huge question. There are lots of things I'm good at and enjoy, but the health issues are a huge wild card, and I know I can't handle a high-stress job working a lot of hours long-term. 

I'm getting As in the classes I'm taking, my PSAT/SAT scores as a teen were high enough to qualify for significant scholarships, and I haven't used any of my Pell Grants yet. With 2-3 of us in college and my low income, I qualify for substantial financial aid to complete a degree.

Ex and I have 4 children ranging from college-age to preschool (youngest will be entering kindergarten in the fall, oldest will be starting college with enough grants and scholarships to be able to pay the balance with what they can earn working over the summer and a few hours per week during the school year).

Ex makes 6 figures, I had no substantial income during the marriage. I am now working part-time as a caregiver at $15.50 per hour (as of my July 1 raise), grossing about $1200-1400 per month before withholdings. My employer also contributes 50 (I think now becoming 65) cents per hour to a retirement account for me, but I would need to work at least 3 years at this job before the retirement account becomes vested and actually belongs to me. 

We live in a high cost of living area, with very high daycare costs.

I got the family home in the divorce, along with 1 month's living expenses worth each of bank accounts and his retirement fund (a very small percentage of the total) and will owe him money if I sell the house within X number of years. He got all the other joint assets in order to buy him out of his share of the family home, along with substantial assets that were determined to be his separate property. 

I am receiving currently enough child support and alimony to cover our basic living expenses without going into debt if I am frugal, which I am being. The alimony will last for 4 years at this level and then reduce and stop over the next few years. So I have a 4-5 year window of opportunity to get an education and improve my earning power before I have to be able to make enough income to support a family. 

I did refinance the house to get it into my name and get money out for urgent repairs. I own an older used vehicle with well over 200K miles on it--no car payment. 

I am currently living on the child support/alimony and saving almost all of the income from my job in a high-yield savings account, trying to pretend that money doesn't exist in my budgeting but occasionally having to dip into it for emergencies and school expenses.

My only debt is currently the mortgage. Mortgage, utilities and property taxes is close to half of the child support/alimony we're living on, but is about the same I would be paying if I downsized to a 3-bedroom (either rental or purchase) for myself and 4 children. My income isn't high enough to qualify to rent a 3-bedroom as most places around here require 3 times the rent to qualify, so that's part of why I negotiated to keep the house.

It's possible that once our youngest gets a little older I may be able to work full time, but the likelihood that I'll be able to work full time long-term is not high. Many with my health conditions become fully disabled at a young age, and I have been in the past more disabled than I am currently and there is always the chance of relapse. So I am building up as much of a safety net now as I can.

I may have some potential income from the home if I were to rent out extra living space and pasture. The ability/reliability of doing that is questionable though due to various issues.

My question is, what should I be doing with the money I'm saving from working currently? My taxable income is low enough I should owe little to no taxes with 4 dependents filing as head of household. So I'm thinking maybe I should max out my Roth IRA contributions?

If I have some money left over once the most urgent home repairs are done, should I put it into making less urgent repairs and upgrades on the house (i.e. replacing badly worn and outdated stained carpets, or windows that are losing energy efficiency), save for an emergency, invest, or put back into the principle on the home loan?

The loan to value ratio on the mortgage is somewhere around 55-60%. (The house/property is worth almost twice as much as the remaining principle on the loan.) So there is equity in the house, and the LTV ratio is improving as I make payments and property values go up.

I'm currently paying about $35 extra each month to the principal, by rounding my payment up to the next even hundred. My interest rate is 3.875% and I have excellent credit.

Also, what are my best options for being able to make a living enough to support a family on one income either working part-time, or combining earned income with passive income? It cannot be anything highly stressful or physically strenuous, so I'm looking into options like tech, writing and graphic design. I am not opposed to sales, but I need a reliable base salary and health insurance, and am definitely not interested in anything MLM or predatory.

Ex and I were married long enough that I will qualify for part of his social security (if it still exists) once he hits retirement age, even though divorced.

Oh, one more question: Should I be buying life and/or disability insurance on myself, if I can qualify for a policy? There is life insurance on ex that would replace his income until our youngest is in high school, but I am not aware of his having any disability insurance.

The Federal Reserve’s debate shifted from how much to cut interest rates later this month to whether to move at all after hiring in June trumped the expectations of economists.

Yields on two-year U.S. Treasuries jumped to 1.87% from 1.76% the day before, reflecting reduced odds of the Fed aggressively reducing borrowing costs in the near term.

There's the income driven plan (that seems to defer - and I imagine will significantly compound) and there's a forgiveness plan that requires 120 cumulative (not consecutive/subsequent) payments while working at a public or non-profit organization (many hospitals have this status). (I believe there's a discretionary income calc/etc. that goes into determining the monthly payments/annum.) My current residency program is non-profit, and I'll be there at least the next three years. Would it make sense to enroll in this program (with the evident limitations), or are there good refinancing programs that could get that interest rate closer to inflation?

solar,Seeking feedback on Illinois residential system design,"Reposted from the Ask Anything on July 2 because I'm looking for more feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a resident in Illinois and there's a group-buy residential program in the works. I just received a quote from the selected group-buy installer, and it seems like a great deal, but I'd appreciate some feedback.

## Usage

Summing the last 12 months of ComEd bills, we consume 16 kWh/annually and spend about $2,000 on electricity annually.

## System Plan

System Size: 11.1 kW

Est. Year 1 Production: 13,907 kWh

Panels: 37 x Talesun Solar TP660M-300

Inverter: SolarEdge SE7600H-US

Estimated \~90% offset - they may be able to get to 100% once a site survey is performed.

## Cost Breakdown

In round numbers:

Payment Due: $28,300

Federal tax credit: $8,490 after filing taxes for 2019

Solar renewable energy credits (because Illinois): $13,900 within 60-90 days of completion

Net system cost: $5,900.

## Battery is Extra

If I want a battery (LG brand), they said I could throw in $9K, all-in. We don't have many power outages, so I'm planning to wait until battery prices come down in the next 5 years.

## Questions

Talesun Solar TP660M-300 - Any thoughts on these panels? They are 300W panels.

Warranty: Installer offers a 10-year warranty. Is that sufficient? No telling where half these companies will be in 5 years, let alone 10.

## Conclusion

It seems nearly too good to be true, that I could have this system for $5,900 after all money is returned!

I'm about 8 months in, so I've paid off like 1.5k of it.  
It took me longer to get out of my previous rental lease, so I wasn't terribly liquid for a little while, but I'm out of it now and can be a bit more forward thinking.

Basically, right now, I'm debating the merits of $100 extra payment monthly.  I get the basic idea of opportunity costs (if I can invest it for more than a 3.875% return, then it's worth more, etc...).  I have a 403b that I'm contributing to, and have the max match from my employer.  But, the reality is, I'm debt-averse and it would be great to pay the place off sooner rather than later.  

But, I can figure that out on my own.  Here's my math question - does it make sense to make extra payments in the beginning, to pay down the principal and lower my interest payments, then stop them and put that money into my retirement fund once the principal is lower.  It seems to make logical sense, but I'm not sure that the math works out.",finance
personalfinance,Not sure what to invest in... 2nd house?,"My wife and I are 40 years old. Own our house 750k with 450k mortgage 3.75 interest rate , have 127k cash and 81.5k in stock market.  Have plenty of money in 401k and kids college accounts adding more every paycheck. 

Make 270k base and 40k bonus per year.  Saving about 5k per month cash after all bills and entertainment.


Want to invest in something else other then the stock market.  Was thinking about a business but since we both have full time jobs and kids we don’t have the time and absentee owners are how to lose money and have a business fail. 


Anyone ever buy a 2nd home and rent it out? Does that make sense? Build equity each month plus have the tenant pay the mortgage, hoping the property value goes up as well.
Any other ideas on where to put money?",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 8th, 2019.

# **The week ahead: Powell’s testimony could make or break the stock rally  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/05/the-week-ahead-powells-testimony-could-make-or-break-the-stock-rally.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has the opportunity to reinforce market expectations for a late July rate cut or rein them in when he speaks to Congress in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday and at the Senate Banking Committee Thursday, and is expected to answer questions on the economy and Fed policy.
*****
&gt; His testimony comes after a strong June jobs report raised questions about whether the Fed will actually cut rates this month. The U.S. economy added 224,000 jobs last month, easily topping a Dow Jones estimate of 165,000. The report sent the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield back above the key 2% level. The dollar also rallied against a basket of currencies, pressuring commodities like gold.
*****
&gt; The report was “stronger than expected, but with an accompanying -11k in revisions the job gains were nothing to derail the Fed’s anticipated cut in 26 days,” Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note. The Fed next decides on rates on July 31.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, the market also has other places to look for clues on Fed policy, including in the Fed’s minutes from its last meeting, after which it suggested it could cut rates if it needs to. Those minutes are released Wednesday afternoon. There is also important consumer price index inflation data Thursday and producer level inflation data on Friday, when PPI is reported.
*****
&gt; But Powell’s comments to Congressional committees could clarify whether the Fed is on course to cut interest rates later this month, as widely expected.
*****
&gt; “It’s not clear to me the data are going to create a screaming case one way or the other. What it comes down to, is the Fed able to validate the market’s dovishness here?” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint. “The one thing that has characterized Fed communications over the last month or six weeks is they’re just not willing to commit to anything ahead of time.”
*****
&gt; Hopes for a rate cut have sent bond yields lower and supported stocks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit all-time highs. The tech sector rose more than 1% to a record as well, while the communications services sector surged more than 2%.
*****
&gt; Economists say the markets would see a violent swing if Powell doesn’t stay on track for a rate cut. The fed funds futures market is pricing in one full quarter point rate cut and a little more for July.
*****
&gt; “I personally don’t see the case for an ease right now,” said Stanley. “Do they passively accept the market’s verdict or do they push back, in that they’re not fully on board with an ease right now? It would be easy to realign the market’s expectations. Powell speaks next week and that would be the perfect opportunity if they were so inclined.”
*****
&gt; Stanley said such a move would upset the stock market and weaken financial conditions, something the Fed would not want to do. But there is not a unanimous view about interest rate moves on the Fed either. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said this week that rates should be kept where they are for awhile. On the other hand, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard dissented at the June meeting because the Fed did not cut interest rates.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said a change in tone from Powell would be disruptive and unlikely. “There are other people trying to figure out what is the right thing to do right now, and there’s no easy answer,” said Swonk. “Jay Powell has made up his mind, and he doesn’t want to be on the wrong side of a recession.”
*****
&gt; Swonk said she expects the Fed to cut interest rates by a quarter point at the end of the month. “All you need is uncertainty. You’ve got that. You need inflation running low. You got that. You need wages not accelerating rapidly. You’ve got that,” she said. “You’ve got all these things lining up.”
*****
&gt; Some economists expect a half point cut, but Swonk said that would be too much since the Fed does not really have a lot of ammunition, given that the fed funds rate range is 2.25 to 2.50%. “They want insurance, but they don’t want to give away the house,” she said.
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed, investors will begin to think second quarter earnings season in the week ahead. Pepsico is a big name releasing its report Tuesday, ahead of the flood of reports from banks and others in the following week.

# Jumbo First Half Gains Usually Continue After a Pause

&gt; The market just put on its best first half performance for the Dow since 1999, the S&amp;P 500 since 1997 and NASDAQ since 2003 – and that’s a pretty decent omen that market will tack on additional gains. Performance below following first-half Dow and S&amp;P 500 gains greater than 7% and NASDAQ Composite gains greater than 10% shows a solid history of gains for the second half – after a tepid market action in Q3.

&gt; Modest gains of about 1% continue into July, but gains little ground during the rest of Q3, which should come as no surprise given the infamous negative history of August and September. On average the market was unable to match first half gains during the second, though the across-the-board 7+% gains over from July to December is still solid. The Dow’s second half win ratio following jumbo gains like 2019 is a rather impressive 85.3% – S&amp;P’s win ration is 80.0%, NAS 73.9%. Full-year gains are virtual lock.

# S&amp;P 500 Sector Weightings: Mid-Year 2019

&gt; Below is an updated snapshot of S&amp;P 500 sector weightings as of mid-year 2019. As shown, the Technology sector makes up the largest slice of the pie with a weighting of 21.48%. Health Care ranks as the second largest sector of the market at 14.20%, followed by Financials at 13.07%. The fact that technology and two service-oriented sectors making up nearly 50% of the index shows how much the US economy has shifted over the years. After the ""big three"" of Tech, Health Care, and Financials, we move down to Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, and Industrials, which are all right around 10%. Consumer Staples has a weighting of 7.27%, and Energy is all the way down to 5.05% after years of losing share. Utilities, Real Estate, and Materials combine to add up to roughly 9% of the index, so these three sectors are basically immaterial at this point.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/weightings.png))**

&gt; Below is a chart showing how much weightings changed in the first half of 2019. The Technology sector gained 1.33 percentage points while Health Care lost 1.23 percentage points, so the gap between the biggest sector (Tech) and the 2nd biggest sector (Health Care) widened by more than 2.5. Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, Real Estate, Materials, and Communication Services all gained share in the first half as well, while Energy, Financials, Consumer Staples, and Utilities all lost share along with Health Care.

# Most Heavily Shorted S&amp;P 500 Stocks

&gt; Below is a list of the 29 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have more than 10% of their share float sold short. Luxury retailer Nordstrom (JWN) currently tops the list with 22% of its float sold short. The stock is down 33.86% YTD and 55% from levels seen last November.

&gt; Tax-prep company H&amp;R Block (HRB) is the second most heavily shorted stock with 20.55% of its float sold short. HRB is followed by sports retailer Under Armour (UAA), Snap-On (SNA), and Kohl's (KSS). While JWN and KSS are both down big YTD, HRB, UAA, and SNA are all up nicely on the year.

&gt; There are plenty of other notables on the list, including Macy's (M), Campbell Soup (CPB), TripAdvisor (TRIP), Gap (GPS), Western Union (WU), and Foot Locker (FL), but one common characteristic among many of them is that they are retailers.

&gt; On average, these stocks with 10%+ short interest as a percentage of float are up 8.5% on the year, which is well below the 17% gain that the S&amp;P 500 has seen.

# Yield Curve Craters

&gt; With the 10-year plummeting below 2% again and the 3-month yield spiking up by over 7 basis points (bps), which is its biggest one day gain since December 2017, the yield curve is cratering today. Today's 11 bps move further into inverted territory is the biggest one-day move since January 2nd (see second chart). While not back at new lows, today marks the 29th day that the curve has now been inverted. In Fedspeak news, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester (who leans hawkish but isn't a voter) just noted in a speech that she's in no hurry to cut. She argues that ""Cutting rates at this juncture could reinforce negative sentiment about a deterioration in the outlook even if this is not the baseline view, and could encourage financial imbalances given the current level of interest rates, which would be counterproductive.""

&gt; What would cause her to change her stance? “If I see a few weak job reports, further declines in manufacturing activity, indicators pointing to weaker business investment and consumption, and declines in readings of longer-term inflation expectations, I would view this as evidence that the base case is shifting to the weak-growth scenario.” A few weak job reports? In other words, she is in no hurry to take any action. Keep in mind, though, that as recently as late February, Mester was still of the view that the FOMC would need to be raising rates later on this year.

# Happy Birthday, And Another Record Goes Down

&gt; “If you’re looking for something to discuss at your barbecue while watching fireworks, be sure to mention this is now the oldest economic cycle in history at 121 months old,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. That’s right, this cycle just topped the previous record of 120 months from the 1990s technology boom.

&gt; Although 10 years might sound old, keep in mind that developed markets tend to have longer cycles of economic growth. “Is 10 years really that old for an expansion? Maybe not, as Australia hasn’t had a recession for nearly 28 years,” according to Detrick. “Not to mention Canada, the U.K., Spain, and Sweden, which all have had at least 15 years of growth starting in the early 1990s and ending in 2008. Going even further back we see that France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Ireland, and China have all had at least 15-year-plus expansions since World War II.”

&gt; Emerging countries tend to see more of a boom-and-bust type of cycle while more developed nations can have longer-lasting periods of growth. In fact, it’s plausible that the United States could have avoided a recession in 2001 if the 9/11 attacks had not happened, which would have produced a nearly 17-year expansion. So maybe 10 years isn’t so old?

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day, This Is Now The Longest Expansion Ever, shows, this is now the longest expansion ever. Additionally, over the decades as the United States turned into a developed nation, the cycles of growth tended to last longer. Thanks to the dual benefits of fiscal and monetary policy, we continue to expect this current cycle to have potentially years of growth left.

personalfinance,my life is changed forever and i might lose my house,"few weeks ago, i found out that my father is in huge debt and he has been lying to us about it saying it's not much. he basically has been taking debt from people with high interest rates (20-50%) and going down the rabbit hole. now the situation is that we could lose our house. cried for few days and after getting my emotions together, I'm trying really hard to get this fixed. transferred most of the debt to a bank with house as collateral but the loan is still not enough to pay everyone. our incomes barely covers the interest rates. my dad is still in denial and i can't imagine what has he been going through.  what am i gonna do? only option i see is selling the housfre which would break my mom's heart.

Edit: sorry i should have said that i am 24 and from Nepal, there's the insolvency act. i dont know how filing for bankruptcy works here but i can sell the house and pay the debts with some cash still in hand so i don't know if qualify for it. 

i live with my parents which is normal here. i can technically leave everything (which i don't think is same as moving out) but it would mean leaving all the relationships and everyone hating me so i don't know.  
and but i will look into every available option",finance

However it hasn’t shown up for the past month or so.  Did I change pages and started looking at the wrong one? Did they change the layout of the site to not show it? Everything on the page looks the same but the missing chart.  Just wondering if anyone else has come across this issue or knows how to fix it.

Or even another alternative site that has the same tool would work.  Once again sorry for the beginner question and thanks in advance for the help!

I recently quit my job on July 1st (no two weeks, just sent an email in the morning stating that I will no longer be working for the company). It’s a really sketchy company and I did not like where the company heading with the new management they have. There’s been numerous problems with checks, employees and other situations that I just got fed up with.

Originally they wanted me to pick up the check in their office but I told them to mail it. I received my paycheck in the mail yesterday (July 5th) but didn’t try to cash it until today (Saturday, July 6th). The bank teller told me they couldn’t cash the check because the problem is on the other company’s end.

There’s been a few times where we’d get our paychecks and the owner doesn’t have funds in the account so we would have to wait a day or sometimes more. Also, the company doesn’t do direct deposit.
 
I already had sent an email letting them know that I received the check and tried cashing it but couldn’t. Since it’s the weekend, I most likely won’t hear from them until Monday.

In the mean time, what should I do or what should I worry about if I can’t cash the paycheck on Monday?",finance

btc,Credit where credit is due: Facebook's Libra,"Hello Everyone,

Facebook’s Libra coin has a lot of benefits and it’s important to recognise them. When steps are made in the right direction it should be celebrated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is Facebook’s Libra a step in the right direction?**

There are billions of people around the world who don’t have access to financial infrastructure, let alone sound money.

When considering this keep in mind, if you are in a developed (typically western) country you have never faced the issues of rampant deflation or an inability to access financial infrastructure (in recent memory).

Facebook is going to make a basket of stable, usable, widely accepted currency available to 2.3 billion people. This is a truly amazing feat. They will, almost overnight, give the option for whole nations of people access to the standard of financial infrastructure many of us take for granted.

Borderless, fast, secure and stable money is going to help an incredible amount of people. I remember when this was touted as almost the paramount goal of Bitcoin. (Although I do consider its paramount goal to be an exit option from the financial system).

&amp;#x200B;

**This is great for decentralised currencies.**

This is not a direct competitor to the decentralised currencies we have grown to love. Facebook is tied to fiat, therefore it is tied to traditional systems, systems designed for financial stability not systemic stability. A great article explaining this was done by Caitlin Long (1).

What Facebook’s coin will do is give validity to the cryptocurrency systems and security, whilst also identifying key concerns that are already being addressed in decentralised cryptocurrencies.

Consider what we hear about Facebook’s Libra project being “bad”: federated control, tied to fiat currencies, privacy concerns over facebook, government’s ability to control, etc… All of these issues are being tackled in the decentralised space. It’s incredible that ‘mainstream’ personalities are now talking about cryptocurrency and how to make it better. Sure they might not realise that solutions to these problems exist, are being addressed and continuously developed, but they are now considering and thinking about. Amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

**In closing:**

Facebooks coin brings a lot of the benefits of cryptocurrencies to the real world and will have a large and positive impact; borderless, fast, stable and secure currency available for 2.3 billion people. Regardless of motives, they are proving, on the world stage, the power of cryptocurrencies. This is a step in the right direction, this will help a lot of people who need a better option and at the same time highlight that its areas of concern are being addressed in the form of decentralised currencies.

Tldr; Facebook’s coin makes fast, borderless, stable currency available to those who need it, whilst highlighting the importance of decentralised cryptocurrencies.

I'm starting a new job this month and was given a W4 to fill out.

Do the wages correspond to the ANNUAL, 12-month salary (although I'm only starting this job now and not January, ie I will only be paid at this new job for 6 months in 2019, instead of 12)? Or do the wages correspond to how much I will be getting paid at this new job for the year 2019 (ie, my annual salary divided by 2).

I would imagine it would be the second option (salary over the next 6 months, not 12 months-salary) since I already paid federal taxes for the first 6 months of this year at my previous job, but wanted to check with you guys here.

Hope this makes sense.

worldpolitics,HUGE: Jeffrey Epstein Arrested for Sex Trafficking of Minors,"BIG donor to Democrats. Bill Clinton flew on his ""lolita express"" to the private island. This was known for years while the left mocked it as some kind of make believe. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Jeffrey Epstein was arrested on Saturday and will appear in New York court on Monday to be charged with sex trafficking, according to multiple law enforcement sources.** 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

Billionaire pedophile [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-has-a-secret-charity-heres-who-it-gave-money-to) was arrested for allegedly [sex trafficking](https://www.thedailybeast.com/feds-are-asking-jeffrey-epsteins-victims-about-sex-trafficking-crimes) dozens of minors in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005, and will appear in court in New York on Monday, according to three law enforcement sources. The arrest, by the FBI-NYPD Crimes Against Children Task Force, comes about 12 years after the 66-year-old financier essentially got a [slap on the wrist](https://www.thedailybeast.com/alexander-acosta-trumps-labor-secretary-broke-the-law-in-jeffrey-epstein-case-judge) for allegedly molesting dozens of underage girls in Florida.

For more than a decade, Epstein’s alleged abuse of minors has been the subject of lawsuits brought by victims, investigations by local and federal authorities, and exposés in the press. But despite the attention cast on his alleged sex crimes, the hedge-funder has managed to avoid any meaningful jail time, let alone federal charges.

The new indictment—which, according to two sources, will be unsealed Monday in Manhattan federal court—will reportedly allege that Epstein sexually exploited dozens of underage girls in a now-familiar scheme: paying them cash for ""massages"" and then molesting or sexually abusing them in his Upper East Side mansion or his palatial residence in Palm Beach. Epstein will be charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors—which could put him away for a maximum of 45 years. The case is being handled by the Public Corruption Unit of the Southern District of New York, with assistance from the district's human-trafficking officials and the FBI.

Several of the billionaire's employees and associates allegedly recruited the girls for Epstein's abuse, and some victims eventually became recruiters themselves, according to law enforcement. The girls were as young as 14, and Epstein knew they were underage, according to details of the arrest and indictment shared by two officials.

Epstein's attorney Martin Weinberg declined to comment when reached by The Daily Beast on Saturday night. The SDNY also declined to comment.

“It’s been a long time coming—it’s been too long coming,” said attorney David Boies, who represents Epstein accusers Virginia Roberts Giuffre and Sarah Ransome. “It is an important step towards getting justice for the many victims of Mr. Epstein’s sex trafficking enterprise.

“We hope that prosecutors will not stop with Mr. Epstein because there were many other people who participated with him and made the sex trafficking possible,"" he told The Daily Beast.

In an era where #MeToo has toppled powerful men, [Epstein’s name was largely absent](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-did-trump-and-clinton-pal-jeffrey-epstein-escape-metoo) from the national conversation, until the *Miami Herald*[published a three-part series](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html) on how his wealth, power and influence shielded him from federal prosecution. For years, The Daily Beast has reported on Epstein’s alleged abuse, and his easy jail sentence and [soft treatment](https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-how-the-hedge-fund-mogul-pedophile-got-off-easy) by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, [which ultimately scrapped a 53-page indictment](https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-pedophile-goes-free) against Epstein. An earlier version of Epstein’s plea deal included a 10-year federal sentence—before his star-studded lawyers threatened to go to trial in a case prosecutors feared was unwinnable, in part because Epstein’s team dredged up dirt on the victims, including social media posts indicating drug use.

Meanwhile, the financier flitted among his homes in Palm Beach, New York City, and the Virgin Islands, as well as his secluded Zorro Ranch in Stanley, New Mexico, transporting young women on his private jet to facilitate the sexual abuse that’s gone unchecked by authorities, his alleged victims say.

In an announcement planned for Monday the FBI is expected to provide a number for other victims to contact the SDNY.

stocks,Do you think Bubs Australia (BUB) has what it takes to go big on the ASX?,"Heres some of my thoughts on this stock:

Advantages:

1. They have made 6 huge strategic moves in the last two quarters and are alligning all their resources into the China market which is where demand for infant formula is extremely high. They are only just starting to tap into the overseas market and still had 80% of their revenue coming in from domestic sales last quarter, think about all that uncapped potential that is about to grow the stock in a big way with the redirection into China.
2. They have created their own niche in the infant formula sector with the first organic grass fed formula and also by using goat milk formula which is seeing good growth. This helps combat the obvious dominance of company giants like A2 Milk and Bellamys in the same space.
3. The stock is very sensitive to announcements and has died down since topping off at $1.50 around the time of the announcement last quarter. I think that the Q4 quarterly activities report coming out at the end of July will make the price soar with the huge growth from this last quarter due to the increased demand channels. The end of year report could also boost the stock higher which is announced a month later but less so due to the numbers already having been released for each quarter at that point.
4. Apart from the short term, I think this company has carved out a pathway for exponential growth in the coming years and will see excellent growth long term especially with the huge demand from China.

Disadvantages:

1. A few insiders did sell off considerable amounts of stocks in May when the stock reached new highs such as the founder Kristy Carr who sold 4000000 shares although she did state that she was buying a new home with the money and the stock was up over 200% in 2019 at that point so it is understandable to want to sell off some shares.
2. Talks of tighter regulations on the importation of goods into China. This could be a huge blow for the company especially as it is still in its infancy and a lot of its increasing price is the result of speculation into the effect of China's demand on its future revenue and profits.
3. Since Bubs is still a young company, it is quite unpredictable and there is a lack of financial fundamentals and customer base meaning that the future is uncertain and caution should be used when investing in thhis stock.

personalfinance,Consolidating debt with a personal loan or cash-out refi?,"A new account that might end up as a throwaway to protect my privacy; this is the account's first post...

**Background:**

4 years ago I was diagnosed with leukemia out of the blue. I am self-employed and needed to immediately stop working on building a company to undergo extensive treatment. There has been no income on my end (other than SSDI) for 3 of the 4 years having just returned to work just over part-time (I can't quite work full-time as I am in and out of the hospital and have numerous medical appointments each month). Because I consult in a lucrative industry, my hourly rate is pretty decent, though. My wife has a very stable career, working for a great company with benefits, retirement, and a six-figure salary. We were able to sustain the extensive medical bills over the last 4 years + maintain a decent lifestyle. Our savings was pretty much drained for both living expenses and medical costs, however, and between the two of us we (somewhat foolishly, admittedly) accrued a significant amount of consumer debt. We've never struggled to pay it, and we aren't in over our heads, per se.

We have several credit cards with varying amounts, and my wife's cards have pretty low interest. Because of my income changes and use of my credit to keep my business afloat, most of my creditors have jacked up interest rates. Again, I can pay, and I can come up with a plan to pay off the cards, but it would be MUCH better to a) have the debt in one place and b) have a much lower interest rate. Total debt we would need/want to consolidate is about $50,000. I'm not worried about the monthly payment on a loan like that as we can probably pay it off in 18 months or less.

I'd like to get some feedback for the sub on some options I'm considering:
&amp;#x200B;

1) Cash-out refi on our home. We have about $100,000 in equity we could pull from, but the idea that we now have debt tied to our primary home is a bit scary. Should something happen to me due to my medical condition, I don't want my wife stuck with this high mortgage that she can't get out from. I don't \*think\* that would happen, but it still weighs on me a a concern. Additionally, we are in Texas, and the few places I've talked to won't fund a cash-out mortgage here. I haven't successfully found a lender who would consider it, so we might just skip this option altogether.

2) Shuffle debt around on credit cards, maybe with a 0% offer or two. We \***do not**\* want to open any more credit card accounts; we have enough and will likely close at least half of what we currently have open. This also gets messy with fees for the transfers and does nothing to just have the debt in one place.

3) Take out a personal loan with one of the companies which offers such a deal. We've gone through the pre-approval process with SoFi, and they have a decent rate on a 36 month note. Again, we won't be taking that long to pay it off.

\#3 feels like our best option to consolidate and save some interest. My only worry is that some of these consolidation companies, I've heard, have penalties for pre-payment of the loan. I'm not sure how true that is. The companies we are considering right now:

* SoFi
* Credit9 (I can't find anything but mixed reviews; not sure if this is a scam or not)
* LightStream
* USAA, since we are members. I don't know if they'll loan the amount we want.

One option we've thought of is getting the consolidation loan then, once all of our credit cards have zero balances, see if any 0% offers come in from existing accounts. If so, we could transfer to one or two cards and save even more interest, assuming the transfer fees don't negate the 0% offer. We may not even consider this as it just perpetuates the cycle of using credit cards for anything, and we want to move away from that mindset.

Feedback, please, from this insanely great sub! We'e been lurking for about a year, and we've really been able to get the ball rolling on life returning to normal from a financial standpoint. We're up-to-date in YNAB and are moving to a cash basis for our monthly budget.

Hello all, I’ve seen quite a few people on r/UKPolitics recently saying that the Leave vote would not have won, had we joined the  Euro.

To me, this view disregards our very troubled history with the EU, so I thought that I would provide an incredibly-brief summary. Now, this post obviously doesn’t go into the debates that we see today, and most of these issues are no longer issues, but I do believe that looking back at all the troubles we have had can help us partially understand why we find ourselves at these crossroads. In fact, a lot has been made about the demographics of Leave voters. Perhaps understanding our modern history with the EU can help us understand the mindset of this older demographic a bit more. 

If not, it can be an interesting 3-minute read. No? 

My two main sources were Pinder's ""The European Union: A Very Short Introduction"" and McCormick's ""Understanding the European Union"".

***

The European Coal and Steel Community officially came into force in 1952. It was an organisation of six countries: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. Now, one may quickly wonder what relevance this has to the United Kingdom, but its inception largely came into being due to the efforts of Winston Churchill. Soon after the Second World War he talked about a “United States of Europe”. To understand why the UK were not founding members, it is important to remember that the ECSC was, intended to keep the peace by way of promoting growth and regulating Coal and Steel (the industries which at the time, would be needed to fund any wars). However, since the UK hadn’t been invaded by Nazi Germany, they didn’t really see it as something that they needed to be a part of, and were perhaps more concerned about building a stronger relationship with the U.S.A.

Britain soon tried to join, [but its accession was continuously blocked by De Gaulle](https://www.theguardian.com/world/1967/nov/28/eu.france). In fact, pretty much as soon as De Gaulle resigned, [the U.K joined the community in 1973 through an agreement reached the year prior.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_the_United_Kingdom_to_the_European_Communities)

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) then became a real point of contention for the Brits. Up to this point, Britain had had quite a strong liberalisation of agricultural markets and had been open to imports in this area. It’s also important to remember that at this time, the CAP was running on a price-support level, leading to the infamous “wine lakes” and “butter mountains”. The thought of butter mountains probably seems quite funny now, but at the time, there were a lot of people struggling to pay for their food, and this whole system of price support, which left them having to pay more money for the same foods whilst some agribusiness produced kilos of wasted perishables, incensed the British public. [This even became part of the ""NO"" campaign in 1975](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1108638/brexit-news-latest-eu-theresa-may-indicative-votes-no-deal-soft-brexit-single-market-spt).

Indeed, the CAP was to step further into the spotlight when Thatcher declared that she would “get my money back”. To understand this, we need to remember that not only was the average Brit paying more for his/her food, but as import levies were used and rebates were based on the usage of the CAP support - something Britain didn’t use very much - Thatcher noticed that the CAP was costing them a lot of money. The way that Thatcher set out to secure some sort of rebate for the UK, was to veto various pieces of EU legislation (and to vow to block payments of VAT). One may wonder today how effective this strategy would be since few areas of policies go through the unanimity process (providing something doesn’t get rejected by the European Parliament). However, Thatcher came in at a time when the European Community was very different, and following the Luxembourg Compromise of 1966 (which preceded the Empty Chair Crisis of 65-66) De Gaulle made it so that member states could essentially veto anything in the Council. So, Walker (the UK’s agricultural minister) vetoed a part of the CAP budget in 1983. It was France, ironically, that overturned the veto. This whole affair obviously led to a lot of grumblings in the UK (although Thatcher did secure her rebate the following year).

Looking at the following government, John Major’s tenure as Prime Minister was famously blighted by infighting around the Maastricht Treaty. [This even gave birth to the ERG.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Research_Group#Early_years) Now, it’s true that Britain opted out of the Euro here, but this opt out was largely passed without any controversy. What would prove to be unequivocally polemic, however, was the opt out of the Social Chapter on all matters relating to employment. [Labour were vehemently opposed to this,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_vote_of_confidence_in_the_Major_ministry) and this along with the Eurosceptic Tories’ disapproval for the Maastricht Treaty’s move to a more Federalist and Supranational Community meant that ratification was not at all certain. The labour market was another area in which the UK diverged from the Community at times, with its Anglo Saxon approach, and it seems that Major could not support the Community’s push towards a more regulated Labour market (with a Rhineland set-up where workers participate in companies’ decision-taking, as well as maximum working hours—which, much to the British government’s disgust, were subsequently enacted by a qualified majority vote under the treaty article on health and safety at work).

We can then look at Blair’s decision to allow unfettered freedom of movement to the A8 countries. Blair defended this on two accounts; firstly, net migration from the A8 countries was predicted as being 8000-13000; secondly, although the EU would allow temporary restrictions on the Freedom of Movement for up to 7 years, no such temporary restrictions would apply on the freedom to work. The thought was that doing this may cost a few extra thousand in terms of net migration, but it would be worth the public image boost (the left part of New Labour had been very critical of Blair on matters of asylum seekers up to this point). Net Migration from the A8 countries in 2004-05 turned out to be 129,000. [For many, this was the decision that would lead to tensions around immigration from EU countries.](http://theconversation.com/the-huge-political-cost-of-blairs-decision-to-allow-eastern-european-migrants-unfettered-access-to-britain-66077)

Immigration is sometimes cited as the main reason for Leave’s win, [but another reason](http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk/?p=1153) can be best described by one phrase we’ve all heard before : “parliamentary sovereignty”. This growing concern amongst the libertarian Conservatives that the CJEU was expanding its empire, thus diminishing the UK parliament’s sovereignty, has moved to the forefront of Tory Euroscepticism, at least in my opinion. Gove has called the CJEU “a rogue court” and Boris Johnson even cited the rule of law imposed by the CJEU in his resignation letter, [although this is an interesting retelling of how he may have simply forgotten that this particular piece of EU legislation was no longer in place.](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-boris-johnson-lied-about-eu-safety-regulation-in-his-resignation-letter).



In addition to all of this, the past 30 years saw the UK often holding the EU in disdain for what they saw as a technocratic and un-democratic government. Throughout the history of the EU, the community has made moves to dispel these fears; the most dramatic overhaul of the ordinary legislative procedure came via the Single European Act of 1986. This replaced a lot of the unanimity voting that had restrained the movement to a Single Market (the Cassis de Jura case also proved essential here as it further streamlined the conformity of many goods). Slowly, but surely, the elected European parliament gained more power via successive treaties.  This move to a seemingly more-democratic Community has however coincided with several high-profile incidents of corruption and anti-democratic incidents.

Under the Maastricht Treaty, Parliament was given the right to to grant ‘discharge’ of the previous year’s budget based on a report from the Court of Auditors. In 1998, the European Parliament had withheld discharge for the 1996 accounts. After a few back-and-forths between the EP and the Commission, the EP appointed a committee to further investigate. The investigation uncovered a litany of incidents of fraud and corruption. [This led to the resignation en masse of The Commission](https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/16/eu.politics1) - perhaps after sensing that they would otherwise be forced out from a European Parliament keen to flex its newly-formed muscle. 

Even recently, one high-profile Commissioner was [forced to resign due to fraud allegations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19964248).

In spite of moves towards a more democratic system, there are still concerns over the ordinary legislative procedure.
[In this speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUKjTPPcOdQ), Jacob Rees-Mogg briefly mentions the issues of Qualified Majority Voting as a voter from Malta has just under a 15th of the voting power of someone in the UK in the European Parliament. 

Even over the past few weeks, [we have been inundated with news articles about the Spitzenkandidat](https://www.politico.eu/article/how-angela-merkel-plan-for-eu-top-jobs-fell-apart-spitzenkandidat-summit/) as we waited to see who the European Council would nominate for the EU’s top jobs. The complete rejection of the Spitzenkandidat process which the European Parliament fought very hard for in 2014, will not have assuaged concerns that the EU is still governed via “backroom deals”. It is important to note that at the time of writing this, the European Parliament may block the European Council's nominations.

Now, this brief look at the UK’s troubled past with the EU does only look at the **issues** that the UK has had with the EU, and many feel that this in itself, is representative of UK journalism. Both Pinder and McCormick briefly mention this in their books, but I do wonder if the more Eurosceptic brand of journalism found in the UK simply reflects UK attitudes. I suppose it’s a vicious/virtuous (depending on your beliefs) cycle.

What I personally always found interesting when looking back at the UK’s relationship with the EU, was that amongst all the opt-outs and all the remonstrations by the UK, there was one area in which the UK government did attempt to make serious contributions: defence. 

[Thatcher did actually want a common approach to defence](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11598879) but this idea would only gain momentum over a decade later.

During the Yugoslav wars, the United States were initially of the opinion that Europe should deal with the issue. This led to Jacques Poos, the then Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, to state in 1991 that “This is the hour of Europe.” [Wars in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo could not be resolved by the EU](https://blogactiv.eu/blog/2010/05/14/the-eu-and-the-disintegration-of-yugoslavia-2/) and the United States and NATO both had to intervene. These incidents were seen as an embarrassment to the EU who subsequently convened to review the Common Foreign and Security Policy (this why the EU now has the High Representative). [Both France and the UK decided to commit quite heavily towards a new plan for defence](https://academic.oup.com/pa/article/61/4/597/1419456), and Tony Blair’s government did this because they felt that as a non-founding member, they lacked gravitas in the EU, something which they felt could be rectified by leading the field in defence.

I do think that it is fair to question whether this initiative would ever bring us closer to the EU; firstly, one has to wonder how much public support Blair, or any leader for that matter, could possibly garner from this. As the Iraq war later showed us, there just isn't much public appetite for anything to do with defence (this is at least my opinion). Looking further afield, could this have an impact on the UK state's relationship with that of other EU states? I'm of the opinion, and I do really want to emphasise that this is all just my opinion at this point, that the structure of the EU's Second Pillar - that of Common Foreign and Security Policy - will always be weak. As this is an area in which we can envisage unanimaty voting always taking place, and Austria, Finland, Ireland, and Sweden will most likely always opt out due to their constitutional neutrality, it is hard to see how large operations will function. Whilst the agreements in Helsinki in 1999 provided for a ""rapid reaction force"" of 50,000 to 60,000, NATO facilities such as air transport and satelite-based intelligence are still needed. As such, either NATO approves of some form of defence operation, in which case the American hegemony of NATO will mean they may very will simply deploy their own resources into this, or NATO doesn't approve and then tensions arise and the deficiencies of the EU in this area are highlighted on the world stage.

financialindependence,FIRE or Embers? Thoughts on a 1990 Japan-style scenario posed by Buffett,"*I promise to get to FI-specific stuff, but it will take me a while to get there, and that’s probably because I’m long-winded* 

I am a fairly risk-averse person. I suspect many people here are too, after all a major aspect of the appeal of FI is the security that it offers (e.g. the freedom of not having to worry about how the rent/food/utility bill is going to get paid next month— a huge relief from something probably 99% of people in the world have to think about with some frequency). I was taking a look at my investments the other day and thinking about asset allocation. I have a collection of index funds, mostly stocks with a dollop of bonds. I mostly took this allocation on advice from reading books by people smarter than me. A part of me thinks, golly, there’s a lot of risk in that portfolio. I turned 30 not too long ago so my entire investing life has been one long expansion. I hear about how this is one of the longest on record. I see things like the valuations of stocks are historically high using measures like CAPE10 and P/E. I start thinking maybe I’m taking on too much risk, how do I really know what I can handle when the going gets tough? Maybe I need more bonds? But then I consider that the government bonds I’d like to buy pay almost nothing—or I essentially pay for the privilege of holding them after inflation. Investment grade bonds? Not much better. 

I feel forced to keep going up the ladder of risk to see potential returns that make investing seem worthwhile if I’m going to have to deal with things like 50% drops every now and then. I am not sure what to do. Maybe I need to find some other, better asset class like real estate, commodities, high dividend stocks? In other words, maybe I can somehow get more return without so much added risk or sky-high prices? I start going down rabbit trails, and soon I’m pretty sure I’m straying into parts of the investment world where I’m the sheep and the people talking are not.

I then ran across this CNBC interview of Warren Buffett: https://youtu.be/Pqc56crs56s 

Around the 32 minute mark, Buffett throws out a comment that catches my attention about how he would bet on stocks over bonds over 10 years, interest rates govern everything, maybe we are entering the world of Japan in 1990, stocks might wind up looking cheap, although he notes that these extended low rates (which have only gotten lower recently) haven’t been the historic experience of the U.S.

I’m no expert, so I didn’t initially understand what he meant, and I couldn’t find anyone else who commented on this unusually specific prediction from someone generally recognized as probably the greatest investor today. So I did some research and I think I at least partially understand, so I’m going to explain it like I would to a kindergartener (or myself about a week ago). Here goes and correct me if I’m wrong: Looking at how investments are valued mathematically speaking, such as a stocks on a dividend discount model, one of the variables is the required rate of return, which is very closely linked to interest rates. If I can buy a very safe government bond that pays 5%, why would I buy a riskier stock that only pays that same 5%? I would require a much better return, let’s say 10% (fairly close to historic U.S. stock returns). Now let’s say that you get 0% on that same, very safe government bond. That 5% that wasn’t good enough before, now looks pretty darn good. In fact, you get the same extra 5% yield over a safe bond (10-5=5-0) as when you could get 10%. It seems almost like the financial equivalent of throwing a few beers back at the local bar: you’re feeling pretty good, your inhibitions for everything are lower, heck maybe you’ll say something to that nice Vanguard fund over there after all...

Anyway, that’s why interest rates are so key. Now in Japan, starting around 1990, I understand that consumer prices started to decline (deflation) and interest rates have been very low or negative for an extended period of time. If the world starts looking more like Japan, if investors can really expect minimal or negative real return on government bonds for the next 10+ years, then it makes sense to pay a historically very large premium for assets that can yield more. In other words, if there were a blue chip stock that (a) sells for a steady $100 per share and (b) very reliably produces $10 worth in returns annually (or 10%), but all I want now is a 5% return, then I should theoretically keep buying that stock until it hits at least $200 for the exact same $10 of return. Across a whole economy, I think that means you would expect to see significantly higher prices for investable assets like stocks, real estate, etc. (Side note: would you see higher wages too? I.e. paying more for the same revenue that human capital would bring to a company? Not sure about that.)

So anyway this line of thinking has carried me back to where I started: probably going to stick with my stocks and a dollop of bonds for now. But it got me thinking that if this Japan 1990 scenario is true, then maybe we are all in for a period of paying vertigo-inducing prices for almost every asset needed to FIRE, or more likely it will take longer than before because we would end up getting less return for the same cost. Everyone will be staring at that ladder of risk I was talking about, making increasingly harder choices about how much risk they can (or are forced) to take on. People that have financial assets will be in good shape but the net buyers of those assets, people looking to build wealth for FI, would likely face a riskier or longer path than those who already made it. 

For instance, I remember reading Your Money or Your Life, the book that first got me thinking about financial independence, and I think it recommended investing primarily in Treasuries. If you do that when treasuries don’t yield anything, then you are basically just having to save 100% of your retirement/FI account out of your income. On a normal salary, that approaches the impossible. Earning a typical $50K a year over a 45 year career is just over $2 million TOTAL and of course you have to live off of that amount. Forget a SWR, you’d have no choice but to draw down principal and hope you don’t run out.

I still think it’s all worthwhile, but that scenario could disappoint a lot of people who look at FIRE through the lens of expectations from the post WWII period. Maybe if people’s wages go up while consumer prices go down, that might soften the blow quite a bit, but I don’t understand if that would happen in such a situation. As far as I know, Japan for example does not have unusually high salaries or cheap COL. What do you think? 

TLDR: Should I keep buying VTSAX? 

Edit: Thanks for everyone’s comments so far. I did want to mention I was aware of the bubble and crash in Japan (though I’m learning more about the extent!). I left that part out of my article (admittedly a big omission when talking about 1990s Japan), because I wonder if we could see similar conditions to those experienced in Japan in the 90s— but maybe without the same exact cause that created those conditions in Japan? 

In other words: what if we experienced persistently low interest rates and Japan-style low inflation or even deflation over a long period (for whatever reason— maybe because of central bank policy, slowing population growth, slowing innovation, low productivity growth, collapse of a bubble, you pick your poison)? What if any future returns were just way more expensive to obtain for a good chunk of the time I’m piling up assets trying to FIRE? What if, instead of a bubble, those high asset prices are a rational response to persistently low interest rates compared to expecting historic interest rates and returns to prevail? How would that impact people’s ability to FIRE? If you couldn’t count on 7%+ average returns while accumulating assets, would you keep the exact same FIRE plans? Could you even get there? Would you cut back and save more? Adjust your investment plan/asset allocation?",finance

investing,Treasury yield curve indicates a potential recession looming. Time to Short the market?,"I've been coming across articles that the treasury yield curve has historically been one of the most reliable indicators of recessions, and that for the past quarter it has indicated as such.

I recently refinanced my house, and have a decent amount of equity I pulled out that I intent to reinvest in another property for rental income purposes. However, with a recession looming I am apprehensive to go in on a new house, if I am to lose out on it's value only a few months later, thereby over paying for a home that I could otherwise get a better deal for if I had waited. 

To hedge against this, I thought maybe one could short the stock market, then pull out and reinvest when the market and prices are down? I'm not familiar with what kind of an investment vehicle is best for something like this, as other than group pension plans I have never done any direct investing in the stock market myself. 

Is this even a viable option for this up coming recession, or am I just playing into the ""following the herd"" mentality due to the fact that people are already talking and predicting it?

Will housing prices be effected the same way as they did in 2008? Will interest rates plummet again in an attempt to boost spending? Essentially how would this one be different than the last one and how could one(and myself) hedge against such a downturn?

A lot of thoughts/questions here but I would love some insight from people smarter than I on the complexities a recession.",finance

personalfinance,"Stuck living paycheck to paycheck, please help.","First off, thanks for taking time to read my post.

I'd like to provide a little context before we get into it. First I'll explain a little about myself, then I'll explain some of the mistakes I've made, and then I'll outline my current budget. I'm looking for any constructive advice that might help me out of the financial situation I'm in. Thanks in advance.

For a little backstory on me: I'm 25 years old and work in corporate finance making approximately $50K per year, graduated in 2012. I guess I'm content with the money I'm making for what I've been through. I know many of my peers that are making much less than me, and some that are making more. I went through some unexpected health issues after graduation that delayed my development, still somewhat unresolved, but much better now that it was. I currently live in the midwest and am happy with my location, but feel as though I barely have enough money to walk out my front door. I'm completely living paycheck to paycheck with savings at practically $0 each month.

I've definitely made some mistakes along the way. I went to a private school (stupid) and racked up about $50K in student debt (my parents paid $0 toward my tuition). That has been paid down to about $40K now. I've made every single student loan payment on time, despite my monthly bill being a whopping $700 between federal/state loans. I believe I've refinanced my student loans about as much as possible and am paying an average of about 3.5% interest. I have one credit card outstanding with a balance of about $3000, my interest rate is 0% now, but will of course become a normal credit card in 6-8 months.

My budget (in a nutshell) is as follows:

Income: $2900 per month

Expenses:

1. Rent/Utilites/Insurance (1BR/1BA) - $1015 per month
2. Student Loans - $700 per month
3. Car Payment (2015 Mazda 3, bought used in 2018) - $200 per month
4. Cell Phone/Internet Service - $150 per month
5. Groceries - $200 per month
6. Gas - $75 per month

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Income - Monthly Expenses = Net Money

$2900 - $2340 = **$560**

&amp;#x200B;

So there is some residual after I've paid my necessary expenses, but there is very little room for error here. I basically have $560 that I feel like I'm fighting to hang on to every month, but something always comes up that needs that excess cashflow. My car will need fixed or regular maintenance, I will have to go to the doctor, Christmas gifts, etc. etc. etc. Basically any expense outside of just ""existing"" pushes me over the edge.

I hope that this is enough to work off of. Of course I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have and am looking forward to any constructive advice that you all may have to offer.

Thanks in advance to all.",finance

personalfinance,Need to up credit score 20 points to refinance,"My wife and I bought a home last November and we happened to get an interest rate that was the max of the small climb (4.875%) and current refinance rates on jumbo loans is 3.875%. The 1% drop will save us roughly $700/month and reduce our 30-year total payout drastically. We would like to refinance now but my credit score recovery has stalled the last 2-months. 


At the time of the initial loan both of our credit scores were in the 820s.  My credit score dropped to 640 once I got the loan and my wife's dropped to 710. In the last 7-months she has recovered to 760 and I have recovered to 720. If I look at my soft-pull turbo-tax credit report I see that I am excellent in every category except for ""total accounts"" which is listed as ""OKAY"". My credit utilization is 15%, on-time payments is 100%, I have zero marks and one hard pull (from original mortgage).


It is my understanding that to get the best rate we should both be over the 740 mark. What would be my best course moving forward to puck up the extra ~20 points? Get another credit card to increase total available credit and total accounts? The only other debt we hold is our mortgage and we cant pay that off in any appreciable amount. My debt to income ratio is 21% as of July 1st. Would paying off the 15% credit card debt I have now help enough? Its not much, only $8-$10k right now. I could pay it off if there was a strong indication it would boost the number. However, that cash would be better served paying off the closing cost of the refinance. I would have to sell stock to cover the costs otherwise and that is taxable but it would all be long-term gains, at least.


Is it worth moving forward with a refinancing option and try to get the best deal given our history and recent changes to our credit history?

personalfinance,Multiple Savings Accounts,"Greetings

I am trying to figure out the proper appropriation of funds to my accounts. I have a Charles Schwab checking account where I keep about $1,000 for gifts / emergency cash. It’s mainly for weddings, birthdays, and in the rare event I need to pay cash for something. Once I make a withdrawal I replenish the amount from my pay checks. Figure $1,000 is a good figure for that. 

Next I have an emergency account. This is where I am having difficulty deciding how much to keep. Usually I put most liquid cash into a vanguard account. My out of pocket max for my health insurance is $4,5000 so I’ve been keeping about that in there. It’s an Ally account. My job is very secure so losing my job is a very remote possibility. I was thinking about capping it at $10,000 in case I need to replace a big ticket item like a computer. I rent and have a new car so home and car repairs are minimal. 

I do want to save for a house and buy my car when the lease is up in March 2021. The buyout price is $22,000 so I’m unsure if I want to pay in cash or drop a very large down payment to make the payments minimal. It depends on the interest rate. 

As far as the house goes I’m not looking to buy anytime soon. It would be nice to have a stash of cash for that purpose or if I decide to get married in the next few years. Figure I will need $50,000 to $70,000 for that. Huge chunk of change. Less if I’m willing to get something smaller or if my future wife (currently single) has money saved as well. 

My income is around $87k. My car payment is $550 which includes insurance, rent is $990 and student loans are $334 a month. The interest rates are below 5% and I owe about $150,000. I went to a reputable school with two grad degrees and in the next 2-5 years my income will be around $125-$150k.  As of now I can save about $1200 - $1500 a month after all of my bills and expenses. 

I’m 37 years old and I max out my IRA and contribute to my 401k so no problems saving for retirement. 

I’m just having a hard time trying to figure out what percentage to put towards emergency, house, and car savings accounts. Think it will be easier to just use ally as I am opening multiple savings and give them nicknames. Plus 2.10% is a good rate and Ally has been great so far.

cardano,"Hey Charles, I just listened to the AMA and.....","First, you talked about a possibility of a stable coin in the very beginning as being a possibility in the future.  I would be curious to know why this isn't more of a priority or higher on the priority list?(I understand there are a lot of other high priority actions but maybe priority isn't the right word to use??)  My reasoning for this is simple to compete with the banking Cartel that is the Western Banks.  I think that the MKR ecosystem has many flaws and one of them being that the interest rates shot up to like 20% in the crash.  Its semi decent but imo needs a lot of work.  Another project that has an interesting idea that is not necessarily a competitor to MKR but is the RESERVE Protocol(Interesting idea of an asset backed stable coin).  Anyway I would push for a stable coin or a defi ecosystem built on top of the Cardano Network (when the blockchain is ready for development) (This is not meant to sound needy or ungrateful in any way, this is just seeing how the space is evolving and throwing out ideas to in the future get more people building on the Cardano Network).

Edit:  this comment is just more for clarification on the vision Charles had when he mentioned the stable coin and what dapp he envisions on top of the Cardano Network in the very beginning of the most recent ama

&amp;#x200B;

Second, you talked about the spending of Cardano specifically when staking and in reference to the 5 day epochs.  Has there been any talk with merchants about using Cardano as a means of payment outside of the Card (in Korea if I'm not mistaken?).  I bring this up because I think that if Cardano partnered with Flexa, all the leg work of getting merchants on board would be done already.  Flexa is aiming to facilitate instant point of sale transactions using Crypto with merchants world wide and already have 30k plus merchants online, granted the Spedn app is still in Beta but I think this would be huge if Cardano could land this partnership.  Even if we are working with Merchants and Payment options for Cardano, I still think the more avenues we have to spend ADA the better. This kind of leads to my next point but....

Edit:  if you read this and have no idea what I’m talking about.  Go learn about the Flexa protocol and then come back for some great discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly, Flexa is partners with Gemini.  I know you've signed a NDA with Coinbase, but is there any work to getting listed on Gemini?  I ask this because with Binance being shut down to US users and not knowing if Binance US will have Cardano.  Gemini is a great exchange with the utmost compliance to Laws and regulations in the US.  I would like to know if we are working towards a listing with Gemini as I think that would be huge for Cardano as well.

Edit:  I wrote this because Charles mentioned the nda with coinbase so I’m looking for a regulated exchange to pick up some Cardano after binance shuts down.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate all the hardwork being put into Cardano and it is my biggest holding with approximately 40% of my portfolio.  I would like to see Cardano succeed as well as the rest of you so I'd appreciate respectful discussion in the comments, or if anyone has any answers or more suggestions to the points above.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you and Happy Sunday! :)

Edit:  I’m not hating, just adding on to/responding to ideas/things I heard in the ama.  I very much respect Charles and team

personalfinance,Experience DIYer looking for creative financing to finish off home renovation,"TLDR; Is a personal loan my only option to finance remodeling I want to do myself?  

&amp;nbsp;

We bought our first home in an amazing location.  The house was the dog of the neighborhood owned by an elderly man who lived his whole life in the 100 year old house and just couldn't keep up with it, allowing the interior to basically fall to pieces.  Houses on either side are worth double what was paid for it and 2 blocks away houses are valued up to 4-5 times.  

&amp;nbsp;

I have particular skills which make home improvement relatively easy for me and live in a jurisdiction that allows homeowners to do all the work they want to on their own homes.  We've completed 70% of the remodel already, with me doing all of the planning, carpentry, electrical and plumbing using cash we had saved up.  We paid for some work (drywall and HVAC) that would cost too much time or is too complicated for me to do myself.  The work has been permitted through the city and the 70% complete has been inspected and approved.  

&amp;nbsp;

Our original mortgage was 5% down to keep as much cash on hand for materials and work .  The house appraised higher than what we paid for it.  At the moment we have 18% in equity based on an the appraisal of the house in original condition with some time paying on the mortgage.  The work we are doing will definitely pay back above and beyond this based on comps in the area....we just have to get there first.  

&amp;nbsp;

We make enough that we could probably save the money needed to complete the work in about 5 years but we would have to sacrifice a lot and we have a newborn and want to avoid living in a half-done house for the early years.  

&amp;nbsp;

So now that we are out of cash and the house is in a semi-finished state, I'm wondering if there are any creative ways we can finance the work that make sense for our specific case?  

&amp;nbsp;


Options I've looked into:  

&amp;nbsp;

Refinance: Difficult because we don't have the equity overhead and the house is half finished making appraisals tricky.  If we could borrow against the remaining 18% we have in equity it would be about what we need to finish.  Then after the work, I estimate our total debt to value would still be around 80% after a new appraisal.  But I don't think we are allowed to borrow down to 0% initially?  This is the rub.  

&amp;nbsp;

Construction Loan:  We'd have to take out far more than we'd need since we have to hire professional contractors to use this money and we'd lose out of the value of me being able to do a majority of the work myself.  Not to mention all of the hoops required to jump through.  

&amp;nbsp;

401k Loan:  I'd prefer not to borrow against retirement for this and lose out on the potential growth.  The repayment period is quite fast and for the amount I want to take out I'd be paying a lot back in and quickly.  This may not matter if I re-fi as quick as I think I can, but does carry some risk since it absolutely depends on rolling this debt into a complete refinance quickly and may lock me into a less advantageous re-fi situation.  

&amp;nbsp;

If any of my above understandings are incorrect and the options need to be revisited, I'm of course open to that.  So far, the type of financing that makes the most sense to me is a:  

&amp;nbsp;

Personal Loan:  I've been looking at 12 year personal loans with a reasonable-to-high interest rate for the amount I'd need to borrow.  We can afford to pay out this loan if I never get to a place where a re-fi would make more sense after I blow through the money.  At the very least, the house would be very livable at this point and I'd consider it a small win.  

&amp;nbsp;

Our credit is excellent.  I've proven that I can complete the work.  Is there a world where someone would evaluate this specific situation and allow us to borrow against 100% of the original value and/or 80% of the future valuation based on the plans to finish?  Basically a construction loan for DIYers?

Continue to make only interest payments and contribute more to the account until minimum payments required or something to that effect? I'd like to hear any suggestions.

personalfinance,How long should I wait to refinance an emergency car loan?,"My credit is currently pretty shaky. My credit score when I applied for car loans was 607 (Transunion). Most of that is from carrying too much debt from being underemployed last year.

(That's based on the fact that I've bumped my credit score about 80 points over the last 6 months by making extra payments and closing some accounts I opened last year). 

However, my car overheated on the interstate 2 weeks ago and the damage was catastrophic. Since I was planning to use it for the majority of my down payment, I had to accept some pretty terrible terms on a Used Subaru. All told, I financed around $15k which includes a pretty stellar warranty and the price of the car itself. My interest rate is 15.89% though, which raised my payments around $60/month. I have room in my budget to afford the payment if I reduce the amount I'm sending towards my debts, but want to refinance as soon as possible. I'm considering taking on a side job to maintain the debt reduction plan I was on, but in the meantime what kind of target should I have for refinancing?

personalfinance,Advice for job with no benefits,"Hi PF, looking for advice.

I just quit my job a week and a half ago and start a new job next week. I have a signed contract with the new job, but haven't done any paperwork yet and wanted to make sure I was covering my bases.

My last job was paying me $41.50/hr (~$80,000/yr) with benefits (health/vision/dental, 401k match, disability, life insurance, HSA match). I had an opportunity with a new company, which has some significant professional perks (travel with significant per diem/bonuses, work from home, flex time) and negotiated a salary of $125,000/yr. The caveat is that I have no benefits and no 401k options (that I know of, haven't gotten set up yet). The new job is a very small company (with hiring me, there are 5 employees) so I might be able to negotiate some additional perks if I can guide my new boss to them, and he gets something out of it.

Some important personal information:

* I'm married.

* I have type 1 diabetes in addition to some other health issues.

* My husband currently works part time making about $4k/yr, and I would prefer he not work full time to help support me due to the effect of stress on my health.

* We want to have a kid in the near future, but not planning on it in the next 12 months due to the new job.

* We currently have no credit card debt, own our 2 cars outright, husband has about $45k in student loan debt (~4% interest, although about $15k is in a private loan with a variable interest rate currently at 4%), and we own our house (4.5% interest, 2 years into 30 year mortgage, low COL area)

* I have about $24k in my old employer's 401k plan, $7k in an HSA, and have an emergency fund of about $3k, although that might decrease a bit since I won't get paid for the new job until August 1.

As of right now, here are my plans for dealing with benefits:

* **health/vision/dental:** I'm planning on taking COBRA. I've already met the deductible and out of pocket max for the year, and now everything is covered at 100%. I have a friend that is a marketplace insurance broker, so I have an idea of what's available from the marketplace, and COBRA actually makes the most sense for this year. I will reevaluate during the open enrollment period. Once I have the COBRA information in hand, I'll talk to my friend to make sure that it makes the most sense for my husband as well. Due to my health history, I always max out HSA contributions. I will be doing some significant international travel (up to 6 months/yr) - is there international health insurance available and where should I look for it? (new job does provide some kind of travel insurance, not sure what is covered)

* **401k:** I'm planning on rolling over my old 401k into an IRA, then maxing it out. I know we can open another one for my husband and put the smaller of what he earns or the IRA max, so we will probably do that too. The PF wiki seems to suggest that's the best I can do without an employer plan.

* **life insurance:** My parents have a $15k whole life insurance policy on me with a health rider I was planning on expanding to at least the remaining cost of the mortgage, if not my full year's salary, depending on the premiums.

* **disability insurance:** I was going to talk to a disability insurance broker and see what my options are. My concern is that my diabetes will be a preexisting condition and also the most likely cause of any disability (although it's well controlled). Everything I've read says there's usually a 2 year exclusion period for a preexisting condition.

Am I missing anything? Are there any other tax perks I could be taking advantage of to help with the loss of the 401k benefits and paying health premiums out of pocket? Is there something I could suggest to my boss to set up to use for a 401k? Any tips on finding insurance brokers? Let me know if I can provide any more info.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Facebook's coin doesn't compete with Decentralized Cryptocurrencies,"Hello Everyone,

I've been talking to a few people about Facebook's Libra and it seems there is a misunderstanding out there; that Facebook's coin (FBc) is going to compete with decentralized cryptocurrencies (DCs).

&amp;#x200B;

Libra won't be competing with decentralized cryptos:

Decentralized cryptos are an exit from fiat systems, Stable coins (FBc, USDT, USDC) are fiat with some benefits learnt from decentralized cryptos.

&amp;#x200B;

Value:

FBc is a stable coin, its value is derived from a basket of fiat currencies (USD, EUR, etc). The value of FBc will be tied directly to the funds in FB's (or the federations) bank account. Also the key source of revenue will likely be in the form of interest on the hoards of funds they store in the Switzerland banking system. Think USDT, with a much greater reach, more stable and more secure.

&amp;#x200B;

Centralized vs Decentralized:

FBc is a centralized coin run by a federation of corporations. Decentralized coins on the other hand are run by consensus.

&amp;#x200B;

Security:

Afaik, the security of the network will be in a closed system of distributed nodes. Which is like the intranet is to the internet. Not nearly as secure as Bitcoin. *If anyone as more information on this I would like to read it, thank you.*

&amp;#x200B;

Borderless:

FBc is not truly borderless. It will have the ability to blacklist, the same as USDT. Places where facebook and its subsidiaries like whatsapp cannot not reach will also have difficulties accessing the system.

&amp;#x200B;

Censorship resistent:

FBc is not censorship resistant for reasons above.

&amp;#x200B;

Privacy:

There are privacy concerns with FBc; will identities be associated with the coins? Whereas DCs have privacy coin options (XMR, ZEC, etc) and Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous so whilst identities can be associated (through data-mining, KYC associations to addresses, etc...), no identity requirements are needed to access and participate in the system.

&amp;#x200B;

Scalability:

Due to sacrificing the above value properties, FBc will be scalable and be able to serve on a mass scale. This is something DCs are working to achieve, however they aren't sacrificing the above properties to achieve this, as such it is a slow process. The challenge in DCs is to have scalability without sacrificing decentralization.

&amp;#x200B;

Systemic stability vs financial stability:

This is a very interesting concept. DCs are systemically stable, you know what's going to happen with their monetary policies, you can rely on the code. Fiat currencies on the other hand are subject to the whims of government monetary policies, which change in favour of financial stability. I highly recommend reading a piece by wall street veteran Caitlin Long on this (1). FBc will be highly correlated to fiat currencies and financial systems. DCs are not correlated and as such provide an exit or hedge against highly correlated assets.

&amp;#x200B;

In closing, FBc is fiat with some new tricks learnt from DCs; it is still fiat though.

personalfinance,Five student loans amassing interest,"Hi everyone. I am having a little trouble understanding my options when it comes to paying back my student loans that I have left over from getting my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I currently have 5 student loans, with interest percentages varying from 3% to 4.5% that I am slowly auto-debiting payments for on a monthly basis. I struggled for awhile, but now have a decent paying job and still live at home. My question is more-so a request to anyone who has tips on paying these loans of faster, or more efficiently without paying so damn much to keep the interest charges at bay. Is there an efficient way / place I could go to take one large loan out (I have approximately 20k left to pay off) at a smaller interest rate, and just have to worry about that? Anyone know any cool tricks that could help me deal with these loans a bit better? Currently I feel a bit overwhelmed constantly looking at the loans and seeing interest accrue and not knowing if I am missing out on some sort of assistance. One of the loans of the 6 I originally had had a higher interest, so I went ahead and paid off the 5k on it right off the bat. Was that wise? I don't like debt and want to alleviate this is as soon as possible.

Thanks for any advice friends.",finance
personalfinance,New Income Distribution and Taxation Questions,"Hi Reddit. Thank you for reading my post. I tried to find similar threads that may answer my questions but haven't seen anything that clears this up completely. So here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

In October, my SO is going to be moving into my house. I am a homeowner and she is currently renting. It recently dawned on me that I will have to decide how much to charge her per month and what exactly to do with this $$. She currently pays $1K/month and I was planning to charge her somewhere in the neighborhood of $500. (Any input on best practice for deciding what to charge an SO for rent would be very appreciated). She works in NFP and earns much less than I do. Full transparency, as you'll see my financial standing is very strong for my age (28) which is another reason I plan to keep the rent very low for her. Here is a breakdown of my current asset allocation: 

&amp;#x200B;

90K - Home equity (about 310K principal left on mortgage loan)

50K - Diversified Vanguard MF's

25K - 401k

8K - Individual Stock Portfolio

&amp;#x200B;

Based on these #'s, I was hoping for recommendations on how to best maximize the output of the new rental income. Part of me wants to apply this as an additional monthly principal payment to my mortgage. My current interest rate is 4.5% FYI. I have also thought about maxing out my 401k and just putting the rent payments in my bank account to cover the difference in paycheck deductions to Vanguard, (even though my employer does not match). Is there an obvious best way to invest this additional income based on my current situation?

&amp;#x200B;

The final and potentially more difficult part of this is taxation. I will obviously have to pay income tax on this new incoming source of funds. Is there a way to best receive payment from my SO to avoid maximum taxation? Depending on how I distribute the new income, is there a way to lower the tax rate I pay on it?

&amp;#x200B;

To recap, also TLDR, I am trying to find the answers to these questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How much to charge my SO for rent
2. How to best invest this new income source based on my current asset allocation
3. How to avoid/minimize taxation of new income source, (w/o breaking the law...)

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if I can provide any additional information to better help you answer my questions. Also, thank you very much for reading my post!",finance
personalfinance,Vehicle acquisition options with a few small twists and the power of compounding,"Hi everyone, I thought I would lay out a situation I find myself in with as much information as possible. I would hope that this could help anyone else in a similar situation figure themselves out, but I am also seeking advice. What I am looking for is not necessarily advice on which is the best option to choose, but more of advice on whether I have done the math right and considered most of the important factors in the decision-making process. **If anyone has feedback or changes they would make, I will edit the post and not delete things but put strikethroughs so you can see the logic.**

&amp;#x200B;

I will first outline the situation: I would like to change my vehicle because: it is a huge, gas-guzzling truck and gas prices are consistently extremely high and climbing where I live (and have been for years); is starting to have major maintenance issues; and is also high-mileage with the value steadily dropping.

&amp;#x200B;

The interesting thing, I think, about this post is that the idea of paying off a debt using cash (or investing it) is the main concern. Obviously, buying a car and keeping long-term (or better yet, buying a depreciated used car and keeping long term) usually makes more sense than leasing a new car. But I was pondering where the line could be when you also have equity already tied up, and you keep the times short. Interest compounds on debts, and also on investments. We often don't consider these things when spending a ton of money, so I thought I would consider the advice of those who call going out for lunch a million dollar hamburger.... So here goes...

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are the facts:**

* I currently own a half ton pickup truck that is entirely paid off.
* I will have the vehicle for 3 years. This is because I see green/electric technology as just out of reach for now due to range, but will be viable to own in about that time. I *strongly* support reducing fossil fuel emissions and moving to electric vehicles as the way of the future. This is a personal belief and I would rather not be a hypocrite for much longer.
* I have $12,000 in trade-in value on the truck, or alternatively a $500 lease down payment and $11,500 cash take-home.
* I have an equivalent amount of cash tied up in a 5% line of credit (which could also be considered the expected ROI on investing that cash instead). Compounding interest, annually.
* I drive 20,000 km a year or 12,400 miles.
* Gas is estimated to be $1.49/L CAD or $4.31/gal USD for each year. (I know, it is high. But I live in BC.)
* I assume average depreciation of 15% per year on all vehicles where it applies (i.e. not lease). There are many different mathematical models you could apply, but for simplicity I will also here use negative compound interest as simple exponential decay.
* Financing would always be 5 years at whatever interest rate offered
* Leasing would always be for 3 years
* Registration is always assumed $200/year
* A car would be sold after 3 years, or given back to leaser.

&amp;#x200B;

**My four options are:**

* Keep the pickup truck for 3 years.
* Purchase a low-mileage used car and have for 3 years.
* Purchase an inexpensive new car using the entire trade-in value.
* Lease an inexpensive car and put almost all the trade-in value towards my line of credit (or invest).

&amp;#x200B;

Here is how I have done the math so far... I am **not** an economist but I was looking for the right words to use and I think they are accounting and economic costs. Yes, I realize that for that to be really the case, the only real difference would be the intangible opportunity cost, but I did want to have a look to see basically which option apparently costed more to my bank account directly. I have summed everything up to two final numbers. Note that they are expressed in positive numbers for my spreadsheet's sake. I have included a type of opportunity cost in the actual cost scenario because for me, there is another debt to be paid, or interest to potentially be made off the equity I have in my current vehicle. It is a certainty either way so it's actually perhaps an explicit cost and not just implicit. This is because I do have actual debt that is incurring interest payments in the meantime (though I treat it the same as interest on investment because it is outside the box of this scenario). The catch is that this opportunity only exists if I don't use the equity value of my current vehicle in another way. It must exist because I *do* have the choice. In other words, I am adding this as a 'cost' to keeping my truck, buying a new or used vehicle, but *not* leasing (because I can and should get away with no down payment on a lease, just taking the cash value away as a cheque).

&amp;#x200B;

**Direct tangible cost to me** (accounting cost?)

* Total fuel cost over the period of time
* Total maintenance and repair costs over the period of time
* Total estimated annual insurance premiums over the period of time
* Approximate annual registration fees totalled
* Sum of monthly payments of loan or lease over that period of time (i.e. 3 years) or 0 in the case of truck or used car.
* ""operating cost"" = (fuel + maint + repair + insurance + registration)
* *cost over 3 years = operating cost + payments*

**Actual cost factoring in depreciation and opportunity** (economic cost?)

* Resale value = initial value x (1 + depreciation)^(years)
* Operating cost
* Depreciation cost = initial value - resale value
* Sum of monthly payments of loan or lease over that period of time (i.e. 3 years) or 0 in the case of truck used
* Sum of monthly payments of loan remaining if financed
* Opportunity cost = final value of leftover cash amount
* ""cost of owning"" = operating cost + depreciation cost + sum of payments to date
* *cost over 3 years = -resale value + cost of owning + sum of payments remaining + opportunity cost*

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't just do it for one year each and multiply by the number of years I planned to keep the vehicle because it would mix linear and exponential functions.

\--------------------------

# Keep pickup

$200 a year to maintain. $700 a year in repairs. $12,000 initial value. 19 L/100 km or 12.5 mpg. $753.24 annual insurance premium. This is essentially the baseline ""status quo"" if there weren't any other options.

Direct cost = operating cost + payments

Direct cost = (fuel + maint + repair + insurance + registration)  +  sum of payments to date

Direct cost = 3 x (5095.80 + 200 + 700 + 753.24 + 200) + (3 x 12 x 0)

Actual cost = (-resale value) + (cost of owning) + sum of payments remaining + opportunity cost

Actual cost = - (12000 x (1+(-0.15))^(3) ) + ( 3 x (5095.80 + 200 + 700 + 753.24 + 200)) + (12000-(12000 x (1+(-0.15))^(3))) + (3 x 12 x 0) + (0 x 12 x 0) + (11500 x (1+(0.05))^(3)) .Actual cost = - (7369) + (20844.72) + (4630.50) + 0 + 0 + 13312.69

**Actual cost = $31,418.91**

*It appears, if I were looking at a ledger, to cost me $20,847.12 over 3 years to keep this truck. However, if I consider the amount I will still pay to other debts (or not earn if I were to invest instead) given other options, it actually will cost me $31,418.91.*

\--------------------------

# Purchase inexpensive new car

$200 a year to maintain. $0 in repair due to warranty. $26,980 initial book value. 7.5 L/100 km or 31.4 mpg. $786.25 annual insurance premium. $12,000 trade-in applied. Taxes applied. 5 year financing monthly payments are $324.65

Direct cost = 3 x (2011.50 + 200 + 0 + 786.25 + 200) + (3 x 12 x 324.65)

\------------------------------

# Lease inexpensive new car

$200 a year to maintain. $0 in repair due to warranty. Initial book value doesn't matter. 7.5 L/100 km or 31.4 mpg. $786.25 annual insurance premium. $500 down payment, $11,500 cash left over to apply to debt/invest. Taxes applied to payments. 3 year lease monthly payments are $491.19. The ""opportunity"" cost will not be factored in here because it would be being used for gains

Direct cost = 3 x (2011.50 + 200 + 0 + 786.25 + 200) + (3 x 12 x 491.19)

*It appears, if I were looking at a ledger, to cost me $27,276.09 over 3 years to lease this new car. It is the same as the actual cost to me because I am comparing this relative to other possible courses of action that don't offer the opportunity of cash.*

\--------------------------------

# Purchase inexpensive used car

Purchase cost (and initial value) of $16,000 implies that I would have to spend $4,000 on top of the sale value of my truck, which gets added to the costs. As well, I will factor that extra amount into lost opportunity as well. $200 a year to maintain. $500 a year in repairs. 9.4 L/100 km or 25 mpg. $662.30 annual insurance premium. Taxes factored into purchase cost. No loan.

Direct cost = extra purchase amount + operating costs

Direct cost = 4000 + (3 x (2673.36 + 200 + 500 + 662.30 + 200))

**Direct cost = $16,706.98**

Actual cost = - (16000 x (1+(-0.15))^(3)) + ( 3 x (2673.36 + 200 + 500 + 662.30 + 200)) + (16000-(16000 x (1+(-0.15))^(3))) + 0 + 0 + ((11500 + 4000) x (1+(0.05))^(3)) **Actual cost = $26,998.88**

*It appears, if I were looking at a ledger, to cost me $16,706.98 over 3 years to buy this used car. However, if I consider the amount I will still pay to other debts (or not earn if I were to invest instead) AND that I would have to cough up a few extra thousand up front, it actually will cost me $26,998.88.*

\---------------------------------

**SUMMARY**

Clearly, in this case, leasing is the most expensive cost at first glance, and keeping my truck is the lease expensive.

Direct, bank-account ledger costs: Lease new car &gt; purchase new car &gt; keep truck &gt; purchase used car

Actual, intangible costs: Purchase new car &gt; keep truck &gt; lease new car &gt; purchase used car

***So it appears that the most economical, in both regards, is to buy the used car for 3 years.***

&amp;#x200B;

What did I do wrong, haha?

&amp;#x200B;

What's so difficult about this all is that I could use the money in 1,000 different ways. For example, one theoretically could use only $6,000 of the trade-in value towards trade-in on a new vehicle purchase. But then what do you makle of the remaining $6,000? I would think the overriding mantra of 'pay down debt first' would apply here. So in other words, if you can qualify for a very low interest rate on a vehicle loan, as long as it is less than the interest on whatever other debt you may have to pay down, you should use the money towards paying off the debt as long as you can then afford the higher monthly payment. This is an optimization problem (and a very hard one at that) likely with an ideal solution but would require much more serious computation here than I can do. Thus, I think it is important to fix a lot of the variables first (as I have done here) and go from there otherwise you could easily get lost in the weeds.",finance

personalfinance,How should I allocate my money if it is all sitting in a checking account?,"Hi personal finance folks,

&amp;#x200B;

I have had all my money sitting in a checking account for years now.  Being fed up with seeing my money do nothing for years now, I recently decided to disperse those funds as follows:  


\- 20% into WealthFront's high yield saving account (currently 2.55%).

\- 20% into Betterment's General Investing product w/ 90% stocks / 10% Bonds

\- This leaves about 60% left in my checking account.

&amp;#x200B;

**Given this information - how should I be allocating my money?**

&amp;#x200B;

About me and my financial situation:

\- I am a 30 y/o male that makes roughly $150k a year. 

\-  I have a 401k that matches up to 6%.

\- I have a Traditional IRA that I ""maxed out"" for last years tax benefits.

\- I have no loans to pay off. 

\- I probably spend much less money than the avg person in my income bracket.  So I have been saving a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I am open to risky or safe investments - whatever makes sense for someone in my situation.  I have been doing endless research on Wealthfront vs. Betterment and decided to use them both (Betterment for my IRA and Gen. Investing, and Wealthfront for the high yield savings account).

&amp;#x200B;

I generally like the idea of a hands-off robo-advisor, as I don't want to put a lot of time and energy beyond my initial research for these investments. And what is even more appealing is having one service that would aggregate all my accounts into one easy-to-see dashboard ( similiar to what Wealthfront / Betterment does ) so I can get a good sense of how I'm doing across the board.

personalfinance,Financing granny flat: Existing home loan top up vs opening a Line of Credit,"Dear Reddit members,

  
Would you please help us to make an informed decision on how to finance our granny flat? We are planning to build a granny flat in our principal place of residence and spoke with the bank regarding our finance options. We have been given two options:

1) Top up existing PPOR principal and interest mortgage of 1.2M to 1.34M at 3.57% 

2) Open up a Line of Credit of 140K at 4.78%

Annual income is 165K

Income from the granny flat at 400/week would be approx. 21K

&amp;#x200B;

We've been learning things the hard way and have not been able to find a good financial planner so far. We realized the best way is to educate yourself. Upon listening to Aussie Firebug podcast with Peter Thornhill and Dave@Strong Money Australia blogs, we came across the concept of debt recycling and hence the dilemma with the Line of Credit vs topping up an existing loan. If I was not familiar with debt recycling I would have simply topped up but the benefit of getting a tax deduction on a line of credit - even though at a higher interest rate - seems quite appealing when compared to simply paying non-tax-deductible interest on an owner-occupied home loan

Bitcoin,[Skeptic] I bought something with Bitcoin in a store today,"Let's see how well /r/Bitcoin accepts non-HODL meme fan boy posts.

I bought some CBD oil for my dog in a local store in Berlin (wow I sound a bit cliche) and saw that the store offered Litecoin and Bitcoin payments. The employee had to call his manager, because he was very interested but had no idea how to accept Bitcoin payments.

The manager got out some tablet, I scanned their QR code and send 15€ worth of BTC. Apparently I was the fourth customer since their existence that asked to pay with Bitcoin. We started talking about Bitcoin a bit and they told me they had lost what I'd assume was their mnemonic seed. I told them they should create a new wallet, but they didn't really understand.

Now two things happened that showed me that Bitcoin is still very impractical as a daily fiat replacement.

1) Mycelium recommended a transaction fee of 2€ for the transaction to be included within the next blocks (89 sat/byte). 2€ for a payment of 15€. Visa's 1-2% seem pretty cheap compared to 13%.

2) As the transaction was being confirmed, the store employees didn't really understand what it means because their wallet app said ""Payment in progress"". I ended up going for lunch and when I came back the transaction was still being confirmed. 

&amp;#x200B;

My take on this: I don't believe we will see Bitcoin replacing fiat/credit card payments for daily transactions within the next few years. I know Lightning Network is coming, but it's still so new and not easy to use.

I believe the adoption that is going to happen and is actually happening is store of value. Expropriation by negative interest rates makes me (and probably many others) want to store my wealth in something that is actually scarce and can't be controlled by governments.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Being told I can't pay off Student Loans until after graduation - is this true?,"I just took out a loan for $55K to consolidate my $10K of undergraduate and $45K of graduate loans at a significantly lower interest rate.

However, it was all applied to my undergraduate loans (which now show a negative balance of $45K) and my graduate loans are still unpaid and accruing interest daily. 

When I called Navient, I was told that the loans cannot be paid until they are in ""repayment"" status which will be 6 months after I graduate (Dec 2019). This means it'll be about a year before they apply the remaining $45K in credit balance to pay off my loan, at which point another $2,700 could have accrued in interest. Which in my opinion is ridiculous because I seriously doubt they plan to pay me interest on the $45K of my money (well, the consolidation money) they're holding until then.

I have read about online savings accounts many times on this subreddit and how they can have higher interest rates, typically above 2%.

1. How safe are these online savings accounts? Which ones have a good reputation and/or interest rate?
2. How much of my savings should I keep in my primary bank for emergencies?
3. Should I even bother with this at this stage?

investing,REX American Holdings: $REX,"[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1armOgtP7P-0IjNAq7qty4SiSHgYOYEKF\_W6Kaoz0vSY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1armOgtP7P-0IjNAq7qty4SiSHgYOYEKF_W6Kaoz0vSY/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so this company doesn't exactly meet my personally happy investing criteria (high ROIC, high FCF yield, and high earnings yield, because it only has a high FCF yield and none of the others). They're a company that invests in American ethanol companies. I currently have the equity valued at $142.68 a share and it isn't trading at that. Or close to that. Or even trading with triple digits. It's trading at half that. So you best believe that I'm currently trying to figure out why they're trading at not that.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things from the balance sheet that I found that may answer this question:

**I. They're not a very diversified company. It all depends on ethanol being a big ticket item (page 16 of the annual report).**

&amp;#x200B;

**II. They have money sitting in banks that exceed federally insured limits. And if 2008 taught us anything, it's to not trust the solvency of banks to be there when you need it (page 21).**

&amp;#x200B;

**III. They have a large investment in eSteam, a technology that is patented (but not tested) to utilize steam to extract deep heavy oil (**which sounds so cool it really does**). They invested $2 million on a patented but untested item and it can backfire (page 21).**

&amp;#x200B;

**IV. The general movement away from ethanol products in general and moving to alternate sources of energy.**

&amp;#x200B;

**V. They have a large investment in a refined coal operation that only has one customer and is run by a third party (page 19).**

&amp;#x200B;

Their performance ratios have decreased over the past six years which I think reflects the attempts to move to cleaner versions of energy instead of ethanol and coal. Book value per share has been increasing steadily for the past six years though and it's trading very close to its book value, trading at 1.01x P/B. I'm looking for some more insight on this company because I think this could be a solid opportunity but I also admit **I'm rather clueless about this opportunity.**",finance

ethereum,Thoughts on how the Howey Test may be applied to the SEC sv Kik case – Stephen Palley on Epicenter,"[*Listed to the full episode*](https://epicenter.tv/episode/293/) *–* [Read the full transcript ](https://medium.com/epicenterpodcast/episode-293-%EF%B8%8F-stephen-palley-sec-vs-kik-libra-regulation-in-the-crypto-space-eb7c04cd9aa7)

**Brian Fabian Crain**: I mean the question let’s say to take this to the Supreme Court. So is that in the end though, how kind of clarity would come about is that like, you know, somebody takes it to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court says okay, you know the Howey test be interpreted this way when it comes to crypto tokens or do you think this is going to play out some different way?

**Stephen Palley**: Answering that requires a little bit of sort of framework about how law works in the United States. The Howey test is a test that comes from a Supreme Court case and there are a bunch of different ways that law is created in the United States, one way is we have judgment law, case law, common law, that interprets statutes and that’s what the Howey test is but you also have laws themselves. So you have the Securities Act of 1933, The Exchange Act of 1934, which are federal statutes. Those are laws as well. Then we have administrative agencies essentially like the SEC which are given authority by statute to promulgate regulations. So you’ve got statutes. You’ve got regulations. You’ve got cases. Judges only decide the cases that are before them. So it’s theoretically possible though I think unlikely that a federal court is going to say, you know what, the Howey test and investment contract analysis that doesn’t apply to crypto tokens. I can’t figure out why a court would say that what is so special about this asset class that a court would create an exemption to old and established judge-made interpretation of the Securities Act, it’s possible but it seems unlikely. 

&gt;It’s more likely that you would get “regulatory clarity” or you’d get maybe a different way of saying it is sort of an exemption for tokens to Securities Act if you had congressional action, or you had exemptions that were created by state legislators because in addition to complexity federal law in the United States things are even more fun because we’ve got 50 states, the District of Columbia and some territories as well all of which have their own lawmaking power and their own courts. It’s a federal system. Right? The short answer is it’s unlikely that this is the case that’s going to change the law of the land anytime soon.   
&gt;  
&gt;I did see a story this morning about proposed legislation that would change accredited investor rules in the United States and would allow people with less income and fewer assets to invest in certain types of assets. That might be an answer sort of a change to crowdfunding laws, but I don’t see the SEC creating a broad exemption for tokens anytime soon.

**Friederike Ernst**: So Kik is a company existed ten years before the token say, right. So basically they had a messaging app that was actually fairly popular for a while with kids and teens and they were failing to monetize that and also it was slowly going out of favor mostly because apparently there were rampant child predators on the platform. So they said they were going to conduct this token sale of the Kin token, which would be used as a form of payment on this platform that they were going to build. So what’s the argument that Kin is making that this is not a security

**Stephen Palley**: Well they say it’s a currency and that the SEC doesn’t have authority to regulate currency and that its regulatory overreach and they also say that the Howey test is effectively out of date and shouldn’t apply to token cells such as this one. They also don’t say this explicitly but I try to put myself in the shoes of their lawyers and looking at the SEC compliance. So if you go to paragraph 7 of the lawsuit and for folks out there who are interested you can get a copy of this lawsuit. I’m fairly certain it’s available on the SEC website. You go to paragraph 7 you can see theme that runs through the complaint. I’ll quote 

&gt;“based with a shrinking financial runway Kik decided to pivot to an entirely different business and attempt to what a board member called a Hail Mary pass. Kik would offer and sell 1 trillion digital tokens in return for cash to fund company operations and a speculative new venture. 

For those of you who are outside of the United States and aren’t familiar with American football a Hail Mary pass describes a move late in a football game. Like there’s like one second left where the quarterback throws, you know from one side of the field all the way to the other side of the field hoping that one of the players catches the ball and makes it into the to the end zone to win the game. That’s a Hail Mary pass. So basically what the SEC says is, you know, you were a failing business, you needed to make money. We got all your documents. We read all of the emails. It is clear that this was an investment scheme that you lumped up using fancy crypto lingo, but basically you were raising money because you couldn’t go to capital markets. You couldn’t go back to your investors. And I think if I were responding to that argument, I would say it’s true the company needed to make money, right? 

&gt;The company times weren’t good. However, just because times aren’t good doesn’t mean there’s something wrong about creating a new product to do better. If that was the case you’d have to sue every company that was facing hard financial times. What we did they would argue perhaps is what we did was what any smart company would do when faced with a difficult financial situation. We’re changing technology. We innovated, we pivoted, we built something new, and if you’re going to criticize us for falling on hard financial times that is a false narrative. 

It’s a narrative that is unfair and it’s a narrative that you can apply to anybody. You can’t penalize us because we tried to innovate, that’s exactly what we did here. That’s what I would argue and you know suppose if they’re watching they can steal my argument right, but that’s not a bad argument.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I bought our first home July of 2018. There were a number of factors at play (rising interest rates, rising home prices, lease ending, baby coming) that pushed us to proceed. I used RocketMortgage and did...okay...mostly due to referral discounts and some rate shopping/bidding. I paid under $500 in closing costs, didn't buy any points, but ended up with a 4.75% rate (30-year fixed). Obviously we've dropped substantially since there. Home values in my area (Raleigh, NC) have climbed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Purchase Price: $242K  

Remaining Balance: $202K  

Estimated Property Value: $249K  

Current Payment (P+I): $1078.25  

Current PMI: $25.71/mo  

Credit Score: &gt;800  

Income: $80K  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeing 30-year fixed rates in the 3.625-3.825 range. A refi to 3.75% would save me $121/mo out the gate and $43.5K over 30 years. I have an accelerated payoff plan already that will save me $54.5K and 9.5 years, but if I can refi to 3.75%, I could add that $121/mo directly to my principle payment and end up cutting 11.5 years and $95.5K in interest off the original loan schedule. This feels like an absolute no-brainer.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming it is, I'm wondering if anyone has any tips or directions for getting the best final result. It seems like pretty much any lender \*should\* be happy to acquire my loan in a refinance. I fully expect RocketMortgage to halfheartedly try to retain me, but I do not expect to get the best rate there. My coworker got his loan through an old college acquaintance that works at a local credit union, so I figured I'd start there. I plugged my info into LoanPronto for fun and got 3.625%, but it was a soft quote. I could bring written quotes to RocketMortgage to try to get them to match, as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

My last and most specifically personal financial question is this. My home is \~20 years old with original roof and HVAC. The roof is okay so far, but will probably need replacing in the next 4-7 years. The HVAC struggles with both the heat and cold, and will probably need replacing in the next 1-3 years. I have a sizeable emergency fund, but a dual-zone HVAC replacement would wipe out a huge chunk of it. I could refinance and pull a little equity out in case I need to do that replacement sooner than later, but then I'm working backwards and will have PMI longer. My other thought would be to get a HELOC in the next year in the event I had to do that, and otherwise just let it sit dormant.

I'm looking for some advice on saving money with the hopes that I'll be able to buy a house in the future (long-term, by the way - still have money to pay off and things to work through).

&amp;#x200B;

* I'm 25 years old and make \~$31k / year working for the state, take-home per month is \~$1750.
* I have no student loan debt, but currently owe \~$4k on my auto loan. 
* Savings account with \~$13k in it - .25% interest rate.
* I don't pay rent - I live with a friend and only pay utilities.
* I pay a lot of my expenses on my credit card and pay off the total balance each and every month. Have excellent credit.
* \~$130 / month in gas, \~$200 / month in groceries

&amp;#x200B;

I know I don't make much, but I'm still trying to figure out my life. Now that I'm working for the state, I can take a certain number of classes per semester for free.",finance
personalfinance,My 17 year old sister got a call from what I believe were scammers and she gave them her SS number,"So I got home from work and my 17 year old sister who just graduated from high school got a call. She can't tell me who it was, what did they want, who did they work for or anything. She has been naive all her life and knows close to nothing when it comes to finances, legal, or any stuff.

She told me that they were somehow ""confirming"" information with her. She knows her social security number by heart and she gave it to them. She doesn't appear to be very worried, but I am. I've been a long time lurker here and I have learned that federal agencies or any financial institution rarely call; they send letters. What can we do in my sister's case?

Update: My sister does not have any credit cards, debit cards, etc. She doesn’t even have a state ID. Right now she is applying to college. But I don’t know, is freezing credit an option when you have not credit history at all???",finance
personalfinance,Refi Break Even and PMI,"Hey personalfinancers, I am wondering if anyone has gone through a similar experience and wanted to get some feedback.

We purchased our home for about $250k a little less than 5 years ago and did not have 20% down, so we have about $180/month of our payment going to PMI. I don't want to pay that, and I believe we've met the threshold to refinance without it.

The market has done well, and I reasonably expect the value of our home has gone to or above $300k, based on my realtor's analysis of our market, as well as the relative rarity of 4-bedroom homes in our neighborhood (most are 3 bed and 1 or 2 bath). 

Given than we've paid the principal down a bit to about $215 total, I assume we are at a LTV range of somewhere between ~72% and  ~78%.

I'm looking to refinance to a 15 2.75% (3.05%APR) or 20 year fixed. 3.2% (3.45%APR) (assuming Bankrate quotes are even remotely accurate). Assuming closing costs could be anywhere from $4-5k, my break-even seems to be inside of 5 years. We are likely to stay in this house that long, and even if we don't, we'll still have a lower payment because of the PMI, and interest rate.

I also understand some banks will let you get a re-appraisal and use the amount to calculate whether they will remove the PMI.

My question is this: has anyone done either of these options? If yes, were you satisfied?",finance
personalfinance,Avalanche vs Snowball,"Hey all, looking for some advice on whether to use the avalanche method or snowball method to pay off our debt.

My wife and I currently have about \~25k each in student loans (relatively low interest rates around 4.5%, none private all federal). We also owe about 6.5k on one of our vehicles (I'd like to sell it and buy something outright) and around 16k on the other (neither at more than 4%).

Our only other outstanding debt is one medical bill that we owe 2k on.

**TLDR; 50k Fed Student Loans, 22.5k Vehicle Financing, 2k Medical. Nothing with high interest.**

We have 15k saved up right now, and our monthly expenses are only 3k/month (including all those payments). We bring in around 5k/month between the two of us. But here's the curveball, we have a baby on the way this January!

My wife will be on maternity leave for about 3 months after she has the baby, and will be back to work full-time afterwards. Thankfully we have baller health insurance through her workplace (100% coverage in network, she's free, I'm only \~$100/month for the same benefits) and won't be paying anything in medical bills for the baby. The worry/stressor is that my income only covers $2.1k/month, so for the three months she's out we're down quite a bit.

By no means are we going to struggle, but I'm curious what advice people would have on whether we should take the avalanche approach or snowball approach to our debts. Obviously with our first kid we aren't sure how much our costs per month will increase, and there will for sure be unexpected costs as well. While avalanche is 'optimal', does anyone have success stories with either that have been in a similar situation?

Thanks all for your input.",finance

personalfinance,"I am quitting my job to attend grad school full-time. I am considering rolling my 401k into an IRA, and using that to pay educational expenses. Is this a financially-sound idea?","**Background:** As the title says, I am quitting my full-time job to attend grad school full-time. Due to geographical reasons, I decided not to attend school at night while working full-time (there aren't any relevant schools near my current apartment/job), though I seriously considered this option.

**My plan:** Instead I am moving home with my parents food-and-rent-free to attend school and I am lining up part-time job(s) to supplement (I know this will be a serious income shortfall). I plan to deplete my savings to pay for year 1 of school, but I have unfortunatelynot saved enough for years 2 and 3. This leaves me with the options of A) taking out federal grad loans, B) taking out private loans (my credit score is just shy of 800, I have worked hard to build this but have not yet gotten quotes), or C) dipping into retirement savings, which frankly is looking appealing. 
  
**My current retirement savings:** I have about $11k in a traditional IRA which states on the dashboard 12.8% in returns, $2k in a Roth IRA, and a few $k in my current 401k. I am looking at ~30-40k in school expenses in years 2 and 3 beyond what my savings can currently cover. 

**My question:** I am considering rolling my 401k into my traditional IRA, and then emptying both IRAs (leaving behind gains, which I believe cannot be taken out) to pay for grad school expenses i.e. tuition, books, etc. Is this a smart move given my age (mid 20s) and future income (I plan to be a lawyer)?

Misc details:    

* I live in Connecticut, USA
* I am in my mid-20s  
  
**EDIT:** I looked and a Federal Direct Grad PLUS loan is currently 7.08% interest, whereas  the average return on the S&amp;P500 over the last 90 years has been 9.8% annually. I do not have a quote for private loans but I have an excellent credit score, wondering if they would beat the 7.08% interest rate.",finance
personalfinance,Home refinancing - should I do it,"Hi Reddit!

I purchased a home this year and then recasted the loan after selling my old property. I was perusing Nerdwallet and noticed that I could get a much better interest rate if I refinanced the mortgage even after the recast. I have about 40% equity in the house. I have some questions for the personal finance crowd

1.	Can I get a HELOC after the refinancing is done? I know if I open it before it would have to be closed but have never done this before so was curious. 
2.	Is it a good idea to even do this so close after buying the home? I am concerned rates will go up so it would be great to lock it in now.",finance

personalfinance,"24yo Art School Grad, have the opportunity to save money short term, but uncertain about future and the best strategy","Hello! So I graduated from Art School last year with my BFA in Photography. Long story short, I come from a poor family and have learned everything about money the hard way. I had some scholarships, but now I have \~$50,000 in student loan debt to the feds. This gives me a lot of anxiety, as I've realized I will not have a career any time soon that will allow me to aggressively tackle my debts.

Photography is my one passion, and always has been. My goal right now for the next 2 years is to make time to take photographs in order to build up my portfolio and get into a competitive Grad School program that offers free (or mostly free) tuition for top applicants. During school, and during this past year I worked too much and could not build up a significant portfolio; so I either do it now or never. After Grad School, I want to start teaching at the collegiate level. Beyond that, who knows. I just know that I need to make photos or I'll be unhappy and unsatisfied with life. I understand that none of my choices so far, and my plans for the future will not provide me with a significant amount of income. I don't even own a camera (never have) and can't afford to buy one right now. This gives me a lot of anxiety about the future and paying off my debts. I'm in a long-term relationship with my boyfriend (28yo) and our current, somewhat complicated situation is this:

* He makes $25/hour but his career/company is a dead-end; he won't make more money than this. We live sort of-near D.C. and this is a good wage, but not enough to keep up with the cost of living. He is making the moves now to leave his current job and go for a temporarily (1-2 years) lower paying job as a Mechanic's Helper so that he can eventually become an HVAC Mechanic and make \~$100K+/year. It will take him 5 years to become a Mechanic. This change is coming late in life for him, as he also comes from a poor background and did not know what to do when he was younger. I feel this puts us at a financial disadvantage as a couple as well.
* I left my FT job (unrelated to art) in March because I was miserable and hated my life. I now work part time teaching English online, which just barely pays my debts and share of rent. I'm hesitant to get another part time job in this area, because we will be moving closer to D.C. in a few months (see below.)
* As my boyfriend transitions into a new, lower-paying job, we will also be moving into his Mom's house for 1-2 years paying cheap rent in order for us to be able to live, and so that we can both save money for our future. He will mostly be working (he has no debt) and saving money.

I'm struggling to make a plan for myself. **Should I aggressively tackle my loans when we move into his Mom's while I have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to save a lot of money on rent? Or should I take this opportunity to build up a big emergency savings, general savings, retirement savings, savings for a downpayment on a house, etc.?** My family is unstable and can't provide us with a place to stay, and his mom will only be living in her current housing situation for a few more years (it's a long story but basically we can cheaply live with her now and probably never again.) I don't want to screw up this opportunity to get my finances together. I also don't want to put myself in a position where I'm working too much and can't make time to make photographs either, as that would prevent me from getting to Grad School sooner and preventing me from accessing a higher salary in the future. What would you do if you were me? Any fellow artists out there? I want to pay off my debt as soon as possible, but it feels so crippling and impossible to choose between making big loan payments or saving money fast.",finance

\~12K in a car loan at 3.9%

Following common advice from this sub after I built my savings enough I've been putting all extra money into my loans following the avalanche method of paying loans. My goal has been to pay off my loans by 30 which is possible if I continue to follow this plan, but I'm beginning to wonder if that fits my goals? The thought of being 30 and debt free is cool but still having only $8K in savings would severely restrict any further ventures like purchasing a house/investing. Given the low interest rates of my loans and the current 2.2% interest on my online saving account, how do you balance paying off debt vs having liquid money?",finance
personalfinance,Am I making the most of my savings? A general overview request.,"Hi everyone. I’m at 26 year old guy who’s looking for general savings tips and an assessment of my current practices. I know that the best time to start investing/saving is always “yesterday” so I’m trying to make the most of my 20’s. I’m hoping you guys can point out anything dumb I’m doing or missing so that I can be sure I’m on the right track! This isn’t so much a request for budget review, more of a “here’s where my money is, should it be in different places?” Any feedback is welcome. I’ll try and update this if anyone asks for additional info in the comments.

(An example of helpful advice I've received in the past when requesting help like this was to keep excess income in a savings account and only have a necessary amount to pay monthly expenses in a checking account due to the difference in interest rates.)

&amp;#x200B;

**INCOME:**

Currently I work from home 9-5 as a web developer making about 118k a year before taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

**DEBT:**

None! I rent my home and student/car loans are all paid off.

&amp;#x200B;

**SAVINGS/INVESTMENTS:**

* Current employer 401k: The company I work at offers a 50% match on up to 5% of my salary. I allocate 15% pre-tax every pay cycle. I let Fidelity handle the investment allocations.

*Current balance: $41,948*

* Roth IRA: This is from a previous company’s retirement plan that couldn’t rollover into my current employers. I don’t currently contribute any of my salary to it (should I be?) so it just sits there and grows.

*Current balance: $14,208*

* Rollover IRA: I’m honestly not sure what this is from. Could have been from a previous company from a job I had in college/high school? Fidelity labels it as a separate account titled “Rollover IRA”. Not currently being invested in, just sits and grows. Should/could this be merged into one of the other two?

*Current balance: $1,649*

* HSA: My company offers an HSA that I take advantage of. I try and put in the maximum amount allowed per year.

*Current balance: $13,883*

* Checking account 1: On the 5th of every month I reload this with whatever funds from my savings account needed to get it up to $5,000. Credit card bills, utilities, rent, and miscellaneous expenses come out of here.

*Ally Bank .1% APY Current balance: $5,000*

* Savings account: Once all the other savings/investments parts take their bites, this is where all of my remaining paycheck goes. I honestly don’t have big plans at the moment... No houses I want to buy or long term plans or anything like that. So my money just sits here until I decide what I want to do with my life.

*Ally Bank 2.1% APY Current balance: $80,528*

* Checking account 2: Small regional bank run by old ladies that will never forget your name. I keep an account open here in case I ever need to withdraw a large sum of cash that can be transferred out of my online savings account.

*Current balance: $20*

&amp;#x200B;

**CREDIT CARDS**

* Discover Cashback card: First credit card, been running for 7 years. These days I just make a monthly purchase  to keep a running balance that is paid in full every payment period. Discover’s free FICO evaluation says my credit score is around 782 but I have no idea what the other relevant scores are.
* American Express “Cash Magnet” card: Acquired this card on May 1st of this year to help diversify my credit portfolio. I use it for essentially all purchases. Balance is paid in full every payment period.

&amp;#x200B;

If you can think of anything I should be doing that I’m not please let me know! Even if it’s something that may not be immediately applicable but could be in the future. Should I have more credit cards where I spread my purchases according to their specific benefits? Should I be investing into my Roth IRA? Should I increase my 401k paycheck allocation? Should I look into CD’s and other accounts/investments rather than having all of my income land in a savings account? I appreciate any/all input!",finance
personalfinance,Preserve capital or pay off student loans?,"Relatively soon, as the result of an estate settlement, I expect to receive an amount of money that would pay off my student loans in cash. This is a huge goal, as my payoff dates otherwise are 2024 and 2029. 

However, I'm also in the process of setting up retirement and investment accounts, and so I'm wondering if it would not be a terrible idea to, for example, put that $X amount of money into some kind of investment vehicle that would generate income for me now, so that I can use it to pay towards my student loans, but still retain the capital once they're paid off. 

Another option would be to pay off the student loans with the higher interest rates, and consolidate the others to a lower interest rate, maintaining some of the capital to be invested and continuing to pay some of the loans. 

I'm late (early 30s) to the retirement investment savings party because of years of low-ish income and high student loan payments, but now I'm all about it and wanting to play catch up so I can hit goals by the time I hit 40 and over.

I tend to suspect that paying off the loans is going to be the suggestion here, especially because of the variable interest rates, but is anyone willing to be devil's advocate and consider that this or a variation of it may not be a terrible idea?",finance

What I'm hoping for help with is just how big of an impact this will be on my credit score, how long of an effect it will likely have, other than credit score impacts how can this end up hurting me, and does this open me up to any legal liabilities?

Credit Card Currently: $21,162 at 12.90% APR, no history of delinquent payments on the card. Pay $750 a month, minimum payment of $95.

I sign up for the services of Financial Solutions and they offer me the following deal.

24 Months at 0.00% APR

Monthly payment of $627.89, which includes all fees.

* $995 Retainer Fee (One time fee)
* 17% Service Fee (One time on principal amount only)
* $10.95 Banking Fee (Recurring Monthly)
* $55 Legal Fee (One time fee)

&amp;#x200B;

Under this I would pay this a total of $15,069.36 over the course of 24 months.

They did not touch on the subject of how long any negative hits would remain on the credit report, and I didn't think to ask during the phone call.

&amp;#x200B;

What they are actually doing, to the best of my knowledge (please correct and expand where necessary if you feel inclined):

They will be taking control of my credit card. They will send a letter to my bank, Navy Federal, and will tell them that they are now the authorized representatives for my credit card account. They will send NFCU a letter, notarized with my signature, that authorizes them to take over the account and that all future correspondence in regards to the account should be sent to them. At this point from day 1 I begin to pay Finance Solutions my monthly payment of $627.89, they take out their fees and deposit the remainder in an account. 

&amp;#x200B;

The money then sits in that account until my credit card is charged off, i.e. they will not pay any payments to NFCU for at least 90 days. During this time I will get at least 3 delinquency hits on my credit report, possibly more depending on how long it takes for NFCU to charge off the credit card. At this point NFCU charges off my credit card, I believe that a charge off will be on my credit report for no less than 7 years. Once the credit card is charged off, Financial Solutions (really the law firm that they use) will buy the debt from NFCU at a significantly lower amount. If my maths are any good, I think that they are estimating being able to buy the debt for $11,757.75. They then use the money from my first payments that went into an account, and all my future payments, to pay off the debt and their fees.",finance

personalfinance,Credit score dropped 100 points after Capital One goofed autopay.,"And we're in the middle of buying a house. 

My husband has a capital one card and had set up auto pay for it. They failed to take his payment, and he does not use online banking and does not have access to check his acct other than statements.

Capital one made no attempt to call him, text him, or email him about the missed payment, and he's the type of person who doesn't check things like his online credit card account to make sure the payment was made.

personalfinance,Help me understand the math on applying overpayment,"I have one student loan account, with 4 loans all serviced by the same loaner, each with a different rate and balance.

Loan 1: $16,000 @ 6.1%
Loan 2: $8,000 @ 7.1%

So here is where I am unsure of my understanding of how the math works, because the interest says always pay highest interest (I’m not interested in the psychological factor, I just want to “waste” the least amount of money paying this off). $16k x 6.1% = $976, and $8k x 7.1% = $568. So my understanding of this situation, is that I’m compounding more interest on Loan 1, even though it has a lower interest rate.

hardware,PCIe Gen 4 and the Phison E16 controller (analysis of der8auer X570 chipset power consumption video),"Hi all,

I saw some discussion in the comments of the der8auer video and the corresponding Reddit thread describing X570 chipset power consumption, with some people wondering as to why the MP600 (and assumedly, other E16-based drives) are consuming negligibly increased amounts of power compared to PCIe Gen 3-based drives. I just wanted to share my very plausible idea as to why that was the case, since neither Roman nor the thread pointed this out, although some people did mention the chipset fan’s existence as being justified by future, “worst-case” loads.

The Phison E16, or as you’re probably more familiar with it, the controller behind every new and upcoming PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD, like the MP600, or the Gigabyte (unnamed) drive, or the new Sabrent Rocket, is the first of its kind on the consumer market. And there’s a reason behind this: it’s not exactly a new controller. AnandTech has an article on this: Phison simply decided to take their existing E12 and E13(T) controllers and substitute the existing PCIe Gen 3 PHY for one designed for use with PCIe Gen 4, while rebranding the controllers as the Phison E16 and E19, respectively. 

Phison has done this for several reasons, as listed in the article (big thanks to Anton at AnandTech), including being the first in an open competitive market to present a new technology, saving on R&amp;D in firmware development, and easing the process of integration and compatibility with other components on the SSD PCB. I wouldn’t be surprised if Phison’s reference design for the E16 looked eerily similar to that of the E12.

What does this mean for the consumer? As you’ve probably noticed, both on spec sheets provided by companies like Corsair and Gigabyte, along with testing done by reviewers like Roman and Chris, that these E16 drives certainly do not meet the data rate “ceiling” of PCIe Gen 4. That’s thanks to Phison’s substitution of the controller PHY, as mentioned previously, rather than a complete controller redesign or iteration. The speculation from several users in the other thread is correct: the actual peak power draw of both SSDs and other future PCIe Gen 4 devices remains to be seen, and although that higher power draw ceiling may not be enough to justify chipset fans over beefed up heatsinks, it certainly explains the reasoning behind AMD’s decision to convince board partners to start using fans. Once controllers better designed to take advantage of newer NAND and PCIe Gen 4 enter the market, perhaps power consumption results will become more “expected” and significantly different thanks to higher controller core counts and clockspeeds, as well as more aggressive algorithms that are able to take full advantage of a new interface.

**TL;DR:** PCIe Gen 4 drives and devices certainly have the potential to draw enough power to warrant a chipset fan, or at least, draw more power than the MP600 did in Roman’s testing. The E16 is simply an early (rushed, I suppose) bridge to fully capable PCIe Gen 4 drives, a sign of things to come, and in the future we’ll have more full-fledged, power-hungry PCIe Gen 4 SSDs on the market. Big props to Roman for an excellent and well-executed video.

personalfinance,Young adult and was recently offered to swap cars with my mom - is this a long term or short term benefit or is it a hindrance?,"So recently my uncle passed away. When my aunt was going through all of his things to see what she could do, she offered me a 2012 Buick Lacross for about $3000 - $4000. We didn't get to talking super specific numbers, because I almost immediately declined. At the time I was currently running with a 2011 Nissan Sentra. I'm not a car guy, so I figured my car gets ok mileage, it runs fine at the moment, no need for a new car. I get from point A to point B and it doesn't cost much. Sounds perfect. My aunt was sad to hear I wouldn't take the car but understood for the most part. She reluctantly sold the car to my mother. They're not in the best relationship with each other, but my aunt still offered the same 3k to 4k price range. My mom took it in a heartbeat and sold her old Toyota corolla. Important to note my mom is an awful driver. My aunt was VERY reluctant to give it to her to say the least.

Now here is the problem: my mom hates the Buick and wants to resell it some point next year. I told her it would be a huge waste because the car is in Extremely good shape and only 70,000 miles. It was basically babied until my uncle passed. She told me she'd be willing to trade my Nissan for the Buick, saying the Buick is a better value in the long run. Thus, for the past 2 months, I've been driving it to see if I'd like to take it on before my mom trades it in. She's willing to give me until next year to decide whether or not I want to keep it. I've tried it again for the past 2 months, and can't help but feel suckered into it. It's a damn nice luxury car. Nice seats, heated in the winter, ac works just fine, good radio (radio is a weird problem with the Nissan. I plug it my phone and it just glitches a lot). Issue being the practicality of it. The mileage is worse. No doubt about it. I felt it being a lot worse almost right away. Google is showing the sentra at 27 city / 34 highway. 25 city / 36 highway. So seemingly only a slight difference, but I find myself refilling a bit quicker than i'm used to. Another Issue is, I'm paying an extra $10-20 per tank to refill this tank of a car. It's also so big, that just parking it under the roofed area of my complex, it's already been scratched twice. My mom told me to not worry about the scratches because she'll just take the hit and sell it for whatever it's worth with the scratches. That doesn't sit right with me, so I told her no matter what I'd be repairing it before she resold it.

 The Nissan has 1 reported accident and I've put a lot of money into it already. 4 thousand to buy it from my other uncle, a 1,500  dollar accident, and already at least 1 - 2 thousand of routine repairs and seemingly constant issues during yearly inspections. This last year, I had to replace the battery 3 times. Turns out 2 of the batteries were just shitty batteries, and the third has been running just fine for months. But with batteries comes with labor costs, all 3 with labor costs and batteries included, probably another thousand. I've probably put in around 7,000 into this car, and last week, it failed inspection and needed to get more work done. The total bill was another 1.2k. Luckily for me my mom told me since it might be her car anyway she would pay this most recent inspection.

The point i'm getting to is: Is it worth trading these cars? Everyone around me tells me it's smarter, it's a year more recent, and no reported accidents. Worth noting it's only needed minor minor work and this years inspection was only $50. It's a good car, but it's very very big and guzzles gas like nothing and i'm worried that if I get into an accident it would cost more for being a more recent car. Not that I'm a dangerous or unsafe driver, but god am I paranoid. It also has some sentimental value because my aunt gave it to my mom trusting her with it. I'd hate to see how she responds to having sold it only 1 year into owning it, especially after giving my mom such a good discount. My main concern is refilling the tank takes an extra 10 to 20 bucks. I know that may sound naive especially considering the deal i'm getting on the car in the first place, but i'm a young adult who's never had to deal with car stuff and had no father figure growing up. The more I think about it the more I want to keep the Buick but I don't know i'f i'm falling for some ""new car trap"" where I only want it because it feels better.

&amp;#x200B;

To recap:  trading 2011 Nissan Sentra (100,000 miles) --&gt; 2012 Buick Lacross. (70,000) miles per gallon is worse on the Buick. Nissan has 1 reported accident, Buick has none. I've already put a total of around $7,000 into the Nissan. Outlook for the Nissan is negative. Mom would be fine with swapping the Nissan for her Buick with no extra deposit. Just swapping the cars. Is it better long term or short term or both?

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,"(US, NYC) Should my parents transfer their home over to me?","Hi there,
Recently my parents (68 years old) have been wanting to transfer their one and only property (first home they've owned) over to me. 

**They believe that it is beneficial for the following reason:**

My father has a degenerative disease that could potentially cost a lot to care for in long term medical costs. They believe (I haven't confirmed) that by transferring their property over to me, if in the future the medical costs become insurmountable, the government won't be able to penalize them by taking money from the sale of the property after they pass away. (Would medicare not protect them?)

I've done a little research and I have found some cons with the property transfer, but I'm not sure if its totally accurate, and whether or not I should reject taking the property. 

**The potential cons I found were:**

* They would be wasting their one time property home sale tax exemption since this is their first home purchase.
* If I decide to sell the property in the future I would be taxed on capital gains (they bought the house for about ~250k and now its worth ~800k)
* If I decide to sell the property in the future I would be using up my own first home sale tax exemption.
* I would lose out on other benefits given to first time home buyers/negatives of having a property that I currently haven't done research on.

**A little info about me**:

* I'm a 27 year old male that currently lives in a different state than my parents (SF, CA), but plans on eventually moving back to NY. 
* Living in the property for 2 years if I end up deciding to want to sell is not a big deal. 
* I plan on eventually buying a property either in NYC or CA within the next 2-3 years.
* I am between the 24% and 32% federal tax bracket

**Given my family situation, should my parents transfer their property over to me? Or are there financial repercussions that make this not worth it?**

personalfinance,Better.com Get Lower Interest Rate,"I'm currently in the process of refinancing with [Better.com](https://Better.com). Thus far the process has been relatively smooth. At the time I locked my interest rate in, rates were at 3.875%  with \~$500 in credits. Interest rates have gone down during the refinance process. Due to this, they have lowered my rate to 3.750% with the same number of credits. Interest rates have continued to go down, and I'm now interested in the 3.625% rate as it would cost me about $800 more.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I'm running into is that my broker is telling me that I cannot go lower. They have an automatic 1/8 of a percent adjustment that will lower my rate as the rates go down though the refinance process. This is what they did for me. However, they are claiming since I locked my rates, I'm ineligible for another rate lock for 30 days after unlocking my rate. Since my rate is currently locked I would need to unlock my rate, wait 30 days and then re-lock. Is this pretty standard? Any advice would be welcomed.",finance
personalfinance,"I'm pretty good at saving my money, but I'm scared of any kind of investment because I don't want to lose it (25, AU)","I moved out of home when I was 18 with next to nothing, I studied full time and had causal work. I saved for a couple of years, bought my first car ($6k AUD, still driving it). Then I started saving with the idea of a mortgage one day. I'm 25 now, I've been working casual &amp; fixed-term contracts at the same university I studied at. I live in a pretty ""small"" town which has made saving easier.

What my situation currently looks like (all in AUD):

* I'm on a fixed term contract until September, ~$75k pa. In theory, I'll get a job at the same level I currently am (because this position was supposed to be perm at one stage, I didn't apply, it got repackaged into this fixed term deal, which is when I came across it), but I'm not super confident, as things have changed. Based on my skills, and opportunities at the university, I could probably get a job at $66k pa, if this one didn't pan out. Last year (and before) I was earning $45k pa or less as a casual. (My SO has just gone up to about $75k pa as well, perm).
* I have a HECS debt (uni, government) of ~$30k. Currently, my savings interest is still higher than the index interest, so I'm only doing the mandatory repayments. I have no other debts.
* I rent with my SO, I put $1000 a month into our shared account for rent/bills/etc.
* I have $50k in the bank. $7k in a ""bills/emergency"" account and $43k in my savings booster account. (My SO has a bit less than me, somewhere around $30-40k.)

I've always been good at saving my money, but mostly because I was scared of ending up poor and homeless again. I don't do all that much with my money. The biggest expense is probably eating - SO and I like to eat out a couple times a week (small town, not a lot else to do to spice things up). I've got a small handful of little subscriptions to things like patreon and netflix. My hobbies are generally low cost - reading, art, writing, walking outside. Currently, spend about $20 a week on wall climbing and yoga. I'm currently completing a short Grad Cert at uni to boost my employability in this career path.

Anyway, aussie interest rates are down again (my booster account is only at 2.3% now) and I feel like I should be trying to branch out. But I'm genuinely terrified I'm going to lose all my savings, end up without a job, and be stuck living on the streets. Maybe dramatic, but it's genuinely how I feel when I try to think about investing. The plan was always to buy a house, but I'm feeling a little doubtful about buying here (chronic drought, bad local economy, etc). But I've also never lived anywhere else.

SO and I (together 5 years) aren't planning to get married (not important to us), and we aren't *really* planning to have kids (it's not completely off the table, but neither of us feels strongly about having them in the next 5 years). TBH I'd prefer a dog.

So to sum it up, I'm feeling useless and anxious but I want to give myself the best chance to succeed at being financially stable long term. Investing scares me, saving is the only thing I know how to do because it feels safe. And I like knowing I have access to the money if I ever did find a house to buy... or if I wanted to quit my job because I find the 9-5 grind soul-crushing.

I don't really know where to start, no one in my family ever had money for investing. The economy doesn't ""look good"" as far as I can tell(?), but I don't know what that really means for me personally.

And - should I even be investing? Is that what I'm supposed to do?",finance

XRP,opinions on these points ?,"Hi im an xrp holder   however this guy below has some valid points

Let’s get serious.

More XRP are held by Ripple than there are currently in circulation: 55 billion vs. 45 billion. 1 billion XRP will be released by Ripple once every 55 months, with all unused XRP returning to the escrow account at the end of each month. That means with XRP at a price of let’s say 10 USD somebody has to buy XRP for 10 billion USD each month. Who could this possibly be? The balance sheet of the federal reserve is about 4 trillion USD. Ripple the company would be worth more than 13 % of the federal reserve. XRP standing at about 70 USD would mean Ripple would be worth more than the federal reserve. That would be an inconceivable power for a private company.

So I’m guessing that Ripple has to give away the most part of its escrow to IMF, BIS, Fed, ECB, UNO or Israel (you name it) or destroy the most of it.

The release of 1 billion XRP per month means an inflation rate of more than 2% per month or about 25% per year. That’s even more than that of the USD.
There is no information about to whom Ripple sells this 1 billion XRP and at which price, there’s a lack of transparency. 

A significant price increase of XRP (in relation to BTC) is not to be expected before the escrow is empty, let’s say in about 5 years. Until then XRP is likely to underperform BTC. Sudden spikes in price like that end of 2017 (induced by not well informed speculators) should be used to switch to BTC.

Then you have to explain to me why David Schwartz allegedly sold all of his XRP in April 2019. He is the chief developer of XRP. This is the same as with Charlie Lee who sold all of his LTC at market top, just before the crypto crash of 2018.

I also would like to know why countries like China, Russia, Iran or Venezuela should use a crypto currency of a company located in the US. The jurisdiction of the US is not considered to be predictable anymore.

If XRP is becoming a success and a danger for central banks then why should Ripple the company not just introduce another clone of XRP, let’s say 100 bln of GCU (global currency unit) and distribute it to central banks? XRP could be thrown out of the net and replaced by GCU in seconds and become totally worthless.

Don’t get me wrong: I’m fully aware of the ILP advantages. Ripple is trying to replace SWIFT, which transacts about 6 trillion USD - each day. But that does not mean that XRP has to increase beyond reason. We as an owner of XRP are not participating in the success as Ripple the company. You may try to buy some Ripple stocks OTC - if you are a millionaire already. Remain reasonable and don’t forget the supply side of the price equation.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Establishing residency and questions about filing as an independent for student?,"I am originally from South Carolina, but did two years of school out of state. I am now twenty years old and am moving to Texas. For the next year (August 2019-August 2020), I will be working a full time job towards the goal of meeting residency requirements so that if I am admitted to UT Austin for the Fall of 2020 (transfer), that I will be paying a  much smaller in-state price tag. 

Now, the exact language used on the UT website for establishing domicile is as follows:If you are independent for tax purposes, you may gain resident status if you establish domicile in the state. If your parent(s) claim you as a dependent on their federal income tax return, they must establish domicile in the state for you to claim residency.

To establish domicile, you or your parent(s) must meet the following criteria:

1. Live in Texas for 12 consecutive months; and
2. Establish and maintain domicile for 12 consecutive months, as evidenced by:

* Gainful employment in Texas;Note: Student jobs do not qualify as gainful employment.
* Sole or joint marital ownership of residential real property in Texas by the person seeking to enroll or the dependent’s parent, having established and maintained a domicile at the residence; 
* Ownership and operation of a business in Texas; or
* Marriage for one year to a person who has established domicile in Texas.

First of all, since my mom (single parent) has no intention of moving to Texas, that means I need to establish myself as an independent. Now I understand this qualification has a number of parts, one of them being a full time student. Since I am under 24 and spent Jan-April/May in school as a full time student, does that put me out of the running for independence, and if so for how long? What is the timeline for this? 

Another part of establishing independence is something about providing 50% or more of your own “support.” I’m finding myself rather confused as to just what this means.

 It seems to me that once I can establish independence for tax purposes, things are relatively straightforward from there ie. Be employed for 12 consecutive months and make my case more convincing my registering my car in Texas, and registering to vote in the state etc. But must I continue to work throughout my time in school to retain residency?

Finally, what are the implications of becoming an independent? Does this have any effect on receiving the benefits of my parents health insurance? Any other things to look out for?

I have about 15k left in federal student loans that I've been paying off on a income driven repayment play for each of the last 3 years. Besides one late payment (it was 1 day late and I paid it + the small late fee) 2 years ago I have never missed a payment. I just did a new IDR application in June as you have to update your income every year so they can recalculate your monthly payment. It says it was accepted on June 2nd. My normal payment date was on the 23rd and I had auto payments set up. On the 25th I realized no money had been taken out of my bank so I logged onto my loan servicer website and it says my account has been closed and sent to collections. There was 0 warning and I have been paying my loans every month.

&amp;#x200B;

I started by calling the servicer on the 26th, I was on hold for less than a minute after explaining the situation when the person told me it was obviously a mistake and that it would be transferred out of collections by the end of the next week (so by July 5). That didn't happen. They also said they were unable to e-mail me written correspondence admitting the mistake but gave me a reference number. I called back yesterday and gave them my reference number and again they said it was obviously a mistake and it should now be by the end of this week, they refused again to give me written notification, but I recorded the phone call this time. I also have saved and printed every bank statement from the last 3 years showing I have been making payments and I have saved all their e-mails I get with confirmation of payments. I don't have access to the actual loan statements anymore as they were only on my online account which was closed.

&amp;#x200B;

 As of yesterday I got written correspondence and phone calls from the debt collection agency letting me know I owe them the money. If the servicer keeps dragging their feet on this I'm worried about permanent damage being done. What can I do to properly dispute this debt. Do I talk to collections and explain the situation to them too? Do I need a lawyer? I just don't know what else to do, I've never been in this situation.",finance

However, Lendkey paid Pentagon Federal about $1000 more than the loan payoff amount. What happens with this extra $1000 payment that PenFed will not need?

I haven't gotten any worse off, but I haven't made a whole lot of progress paying it all down.

I just signed up for YNAB, because I realized I wasn't making any progress and I wanted to get serious about getting rid of my debt. With YNAB, I'm doing a lot better about my spending, but I'm noticing that my interest rates are killing me (\~25% and \~29%). I'm paying about $1,000-$1,200 a month on each of those cards and between interest and new purchases, it's hard to get any movement. 

Does a 3-year loan of 12.47% and $557/month seem like a good move? I'm thinking at the very least, I'll save a ton in interest. My worry is that I'm underestimating how much that $557 would be (right now, the payments I'm making are for both debt and new purchases, it's hard to see how much of that is going towards the debt itself), and I would end up racking up new CC debt while trying to pay down the loan.

personalfinance,Roth vs traditional IRA,"My brother just graduated from college and was able to secure a decent job. He asked for our inputs to help him budget. He will be in the 30% bracket. Besides maxing out 401k, I recommended Roth 401k but my husband thinks traditional IRA would be better. My reasoning is that he’s early in his career so hasn’t hit peak earning yet so Roth would be more beneficial to building wealth right now. My husband thinks 30% tã (FICA and fed) is still high and would rather shield from that and let it grow. 
Anyone with more knowledge about the two to help us settle this? Thanks",finance

personalfinance,"University of Phoenix Alleging Veteran Owes Them $1,345.34 and Charges-Off Account","Just as the title states.

**Back Story:**  
I am a Veteran that attended the University of Phoenix (in Arizona) for quiet some time in order to obtain a Criminal Justice Administration Degree. My entire degree program was funded thanks to the amazing benefits of the Post 9/11 GI Bill under chapter 33. I took all of my courses and passed each one until I stopped taking courses in the beginning of 2017 due to unrelated personal reasons. Fast forward to November 2018, I decided to resume my classes to finish the last 7 credits I had. I connected with a Academic counselor and Financial Advisory and was scheduled for a BIO/101 course from December 2018 - January 2018 and a HUM/115 course from February 2018 - March 2018. I was told by the UoP reps/advisors that the VA would cover both courses 100%. I attended and passed the courses without issue.

Here's where the problem begins:  
Last Friday (07/05/2019) I receive an alert from all three credit bureaus stating that an account from UoP in the amount of $1,345.34 was reported as a charge-off. Being Friday evening there wasn't much I could do until Monday (today 7/8/2019). After making a Several calls and dealing with less than adequate/knowledgeable staff/reps and advisors, no one seemed to be able to assist me. After finally loosing my patience and chewing out a few people over the phone (really didn't want to resort to this) I finally get some notes on my account that state the following: "" File will remain inactive student is ineligible for ch 33 benefits. Payment missing for term dated 02/05/2018- 03/12/2018. Called Federal VA. Veterans Training time enter for ch33 benefits and the Federal VA went back and removed due to training time in June and letter was sent to student explaining they are ineligible for ch 33 benefits. Student will be responsible for cost of class.""

**After asking more questions this is what I found out:**  
10 MONTHS after I took my course (HUM 115, 02/05/2018- 03/12/2018) and being told by the Federal VA would cover 100% of the courses, the Federal VA told the UoP that they are not covering the cost of the course, which left me hanging dry with the cost of the course. Unbeknownst to me, no one emailed me, called me, or mailed me regarding this issue.

My benefits have never changed. My Veteran status has never changed (honorable discharge), I still have more than plenty of funds left under my chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill. A few things are possible: **1)** UoP filed my paperwork incorrectly leading the Federal VA to believe I did not qualify for Chapter 33 benefits under the Post 9/11 GI Bill (which is not likely since they paid for the first course I took BIO/101). **2)** The rep/advisor who scheduled my classes mistakenly scheduled me for a class (HUM/115) that was not covered by the Federal VA under my chapter 33 benefits, which I think is the most likely scenerio. I don't know a Veteran with Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits (or anyone for that matter) who would purposefully schedule a class or course that he/she would have to pay out of pocket for when they have benefits that would cover the course.

**Unsure of what next steps to take:**  
I spoke to several representatives and none were helpful, except the one I chewed out and gave me the one bit of info that sort helped. I'm left with a charged-off account/derogatory comments on my credit reports for a debt I was told would be covered when it actually wasn't covered. Had I known the course would not be covered, I wouldn't have taken it, instead I would have taken a course that the VA did cover.

Their BBB profile is filled with horrible reviews and the likes.. I'm sure some debt/claims are valid.. however, I fail to see that I am responsible for the cost of the the course ($1,345.34) when I was told that the federal VA would cover the costs. How is it even fair that 10 MONTHS AFTER UoP is hunting me and ruining my credit for something that I AM NOT responsible for?? Should I be worried for my other dozens and dozen of courses I previously took? It really seems the issue is between the Federal VA and UoP and not with me.

None one at the UoP is able to properly help. It's quiet frustrating. Does anyone has ANY ideas on how to go about disputing this? What options do I have? Any ideas on how I could remove this from my credit reports? Anyone ever been in a similar situation?

P.S this is not a throw away, just never really posted on reddit before. All/any advice recommendations would really, really be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"Owe $8,000 on a crappy car- trade in, refinance, or aggressively pay off current loan","Hi all!

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I own a lemon that I owe $8,000 on with 36 months left and 5.99% interest rate.

Got the car straight out of college when I made terrible money. Now I make $11,000 more a year and I need to figure out a new plan. The car constantly has things wrong with it, and I'm spending around $2,000-3,000 a year in repairs.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the best plan of action?

* A.) Refinance to a 24 month loan with better interest rate, higher monthly payment, but pay off faster
* B.) Refinance to another 36 month loan with a better interest rate, lower monthly payment, use extra monthly money for repairs
* C.) Trade in and start a new loan with a new car. My kellybluebook value on it is $5,000 (if it were in good condition but who knows what else is wrong with it at this point.)
* D.) Aggressively pay down my current loan

&amp;#x200B;

*\*My current financial focus is not my car right now, but paying down credit card debt which has a higher interest rate than the auto loan. (Unless you disagree and think it should be my car- CMV) Things are tight. At the same time, I'm trapped putting these  costs of repairs on my credit cards and accruing more debt!! Ugh. I know I just simply don't have enough income coming in (my budget has no other wiggle room right now- no luxuries, bare minimum) and I'm trying to fix the income issue.*

These numbers are not exact, as the loan is in my parents name, and they are generally incompetent with this kind of thing. I can't access the loan information easily (although the payments are taken directly from my account) because of a disconnect with my parents. 

I'd like to refinance these loans, as i'm making payments on them anyway and dealing with them in this current situation with my parents is nothing short of awful. My current financial stats are 24 y/o, 85k yearly salary, and 39k in federal student loans. I also have a 705 credit score as of now, although this is subject to rise to around 730 as I put a large purchase on a rewards CC and then didn't pay it off in full before it counted on my credit report (oops).

personalfinance,Situation seems impossible-private student loans asking for 50%+ of my income,"I am a first generation college graduate and was very uneducated about loans.  I have about 20,000 in federal loans that are on income based repayments ($0/month) and about 70,000 in private loans.

I took a volunteer job that paid me next to nothing and sank me into depression and I ended up leaving early and losing out on a scholarship. I had minimum wage jobs and no job for a bit while I looked for a job in my field (Environmentsl Studies).  I racked up $4,000 in credit card debt and couldnt make my payments and was told I needed to ""wait until my debt went to collections"" in order to set up payments I could afford. Debt was charged off, my credit score took a hit but I'm now making monthly payments.

Current situation: My private loans allowed a year deferment (I missed out on my 6 month grace period due to joining a volunteer program immediately, which I was unaware would happen)  and then I received 12 months on a hardship program paying less a month with very little interest.  Now, they will ""consider"" different options but only after making 6 months of minimum monthly payments of $740. I am in an entry level position related to my field but am getting pretty crap pay and I need to work there a bit longer before getting any kind of raise.

My income/finances:

Income: $1,360/month take home after insurance, 401k, etc.

Rent: $300 (cramped af)

Utilities: $80

Phone: $73

Credit card: $110

Gym: $22

Car insurance: $162

Car payment: $150 (mom helps sometimes)

Food for cats and myself: $100

Total Income: $1360
Total Bills: roughly  $900-$1000
Leftover: roughly $360-$460

Lately I haven't even had that much leftover due to covering double rent for the new year, bringing cats to the vet, going to the dentist, and various surprise payments.

I dont have enough for the private loan payment to begin with and then having anything left to save or for surprise bills is impossible.

I know consolidating or refinancing are my best options but my credit check shows a charge off and no place will refinance with that, and my credit is about 560.  If I dont make the payments my credit will tank and so will my parents-the cosigners.  

I spoke with the lender and they will not budge.

I am trying to find a second job but I am afraid of the impact to my mental health. I have only been at my job for 4-5 months but know im being severely underpaid despite being entry level, but they are not the best at training so I dont yet have the skills to negotiate a better wage.

Is a second job my only option? I cant get much thriftier living-wise so I either need lower payments or more income.  I just want to have a balanced and healthy life, I'm not trying to make bank or get out of debt earlier- I just want to live my life.",finance
personalfinance,Should I switch to Alliant Credit Union from my local credit union now that I'm making and spending more money?,"Hi all, looking for some advice on my particular situation after reading through the wiki here. 

**Some background:** 

* Joined my local credit union (Capital Communications FCU) in high school when I started working a part-time job.
* Currently have a young adult checking account (the primary perk being free, worldwide ATM access until age 25 but 0% APY), a primary savings account (0.15% APY), and a VISA Classic credit card (13.90% APR). 
* Recently graduated college and will be moving out of the area to start a software engineering job, looking to improve my finances. 
* Have a good credit score with the only dings being I ""only"" have one student loan (about to be two) and one credit card and that my credit card is just 3.5 years old.

  
**Spending/banking habits:**

* My credit card usage is 0% (and I anticipate this won't change) and I usually transfer funds from my savings to my checking account when I need to pay bills (rent, groceries, car insurance, etc.)
* Don't anticipate needing to take out auto loans or a mortgage any time soon (own a reliable and fairly new vehicle and will be renting for a while).
* Should be able to set up an emergency fund pretty easily with my current savings (thus reducing the probability of needing a personal loan).
* Rarely withdraw cash or deposit checks (but doing so through mobile banking is super easy, as is transferring funds). My current credit union is part of the CO-OP network so in my new city I'd have access to CO-OP branches and surcharge-free ATMs.

&amp;#x200B;

Given that information, does it seem reasonable that I might want to move over to Alliant credit union to take advantage of their high savings and checking account interest rates? I could open a money market account with my current credit union to take advantage of a 0.10% dividend rate with a dividend checking account but that's the most improvement I could make. The Alliant $20/month ATM refunds/month should work fine for me and although I plan to travel internationally, the 1% foreign exchange fee seems less important than the interest rates.

Years ago (1996) I left service after 11 years in New York State as a vested employee, the final three years as an RN. At that time I obtained a loan against my pension for moving expenses, but stupidly neglected to pay back this loan. I have written to them and received a response, but am unsure which action would be the best to take. The letters are as follows:

Question:
   To Whom It May Concern: I have a time-sensitive inquiry regarding my
retirement account and associated outstanding loan balance. (Please see the
attached summary of my account.) I worked in State service for 11 years and
am vested. At the time that I left State service I obtained a loan against
this account, which has now grown due to interest applied. I would like to
resolve this as soon as possible, and would like to know my options.
   1. My account balance is $32,006.55, and my loan balance - which
increases monthly due to interest - is now $38,102.17. In order to keep
interest from accruing, I understand that I should simply pay the
$38,102.17 in order to balance my account. My question here is, I have
borrowed against my own account, so once the loan is repaid, will my
account remain at $32,006.55, or will the repaid loan be applied to my
retirement account, adding up to a total of $70,108.72?
   2. Are one of my options simply to liquidate my retirement account
and pay the difference on the loan amount, well aware that in either case
Federal taxes are owed on interest rates?

resolve this issue and avoid paying any extra taxes and fees associated
with the loan balance.

Response:
   This email message is in response to your questions concerning loans.

   Upon repayment of your loan, your contribution balance will not
increase. When a member takes a loan from NYSLRS, they are borrowing from
the NYSLRS pension accumulation fund, not their mandatory contribution
balance.
   You may still collect your retirement benefit without paying your
loan. However, there will be a permanent reduction to your monthly benefit
that is calculated using your age at retirement and the amount of your
outstanding loan. Additionally, the interest that has accrued on your loan
balance since its default in 1997 will be considered taxable by the IRS for
the year in which you retire.
   In order to apply for retirement, we must receive your RS6037
Application for Service Retirement, between 15 - 90 days prior to your
chosen date of retirement. You will also need to provide us with an Option
Election form and your proof of birth, as well as your intended
beneficiary, if choosing a continuing option. We are mailing you the
appropriate forms that you will need to file. You will receive an
acknowledgement of your application, once it has been received and reviewed
for acceptance. The forms are available on the website below.
   A legible copy of any one of the following documents may be submitted
as proof of birth, provided it shows the date of birth, or age on a given
date. If there is a discrepancy between the date of birth on your document,
and the date of birth we have on file for you, we will require two original
documents from the list. Once verified, we will return the documents back
to you, by Certified Mail - Return Receipt Requested . . . 

Is it better to pay off the loan in order to receive retirement benefits later on? It just doesn’t seem it would amount to much anyway. They say I can retire at age 55 - does this retirement just apply to my service in New York State, and despite the fact that I plan to continue to work for quite a few more years here in California? think if I retired now from NYS I would owe the IRS about $10,000, maybe a little more, which is preferable to draining my bank account of $38,000.

personalfinance,Dealership submitted my credit application with the incorrect income,"On July 1 evening, I agreed to purchase a new car from a Houston dealership and filled out their handwritten credit application with my income as $8,000 monthly. Salesperson gives the handwritten credit application to the finance manager while I wait at the front of the dealership. Without allowing me to verify the information and sign the consent to forward my credit application and obtain my credit reports, finance manager submits the typed credit application, but the banks were closed for the day to figure out if the loans got approved or denied.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 2 morning, finance manager tells me one loan got approved and two loans got denied due to ""High debt-to-income ratio"" for a new car that I already paid about 80% with the down payment and two trade ins and needed 20% financed. I sign the paperwork dated July 2 for the loan that got approved including the credit application consent. I receive a copy of the paperwork and took delivery of the new car.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 4, I noticed on the copy of the typed credit application timestamped July 1 the income was $8,000 yearly and it did not match what I wrote. I called my salesperson for a copy of the handwritten credit application to find out if I wrote my income incorrectly, but he tells me the accounting office was not available that day.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 5, finance manager was certain that the income was submitted as $8,000 monthly and provided a screenshot of the ""Applicant Information"" with $8,000 monthly income shown which seems like it allowed changes before sending it to me. I decide to call the bank that approved the loan to see what they receive on the credit application as my income and ended up speaking with the underwriter that approved and finalized the deal. Underwriter claims it was submitted as $800 monthly income, but knew the loan would not get approved so underwriter assumed it was an error and added an extra zero to the end without contacting the dealership to verify which is fraud. This meant the other two banks did in fact received the incorrect income, but did not attempt to fix it and just straight up denied the loan. At this point, I tell my salesperson that I have decided to pay off the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 6, I tell the finance manager that I wanted to meet in person to get clarification as to how everything could have happened, but their response was they did not understand what the issue is. I went to the dealership and met with the finance manager. From this conversation, I found out that initially the income was in fact sent incorrect, but since the banks were closed for the day they couldn't fix the error. Finance manager claims they fixed the error, but did not get a callback until July 5 from the two banks that declined. Finance manager tells me the loan approval was changed from negative denied to positive approved in my credit report. From my research, denied loans shouldn't affect my credit score anyways. Finance manager proceeds to provide me a copy of the corrected typed credit application timestamped July 6 a couple minutes before we spoke. They also let me know that underwriters are not allowed to talk to clients/borrowers, but from my research it is at the discretion of the bank whether they allow it or not.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 7, I noticed at least one extra credit inquiry dated July 6 from one of the banks that declined was added to my credit report. I originally already received three hard pulls dated July 1st from each bank on my credit report.

&amp;#x200B;

Finance manager never told me they were fixing the error prior to me finding out about it and always told me it was sent correctly when asked about it. They admitted the income was sent incorrectly initially after I decided to speak with them in person where I showed them that my copy of the credit application had the wrong income. It makes me think they did not realized they made an error until after I made them aware of it. General manager of the dealership was made aware of the issue too by email. Even though they messed up, they didn't provide anything for the inconvenience.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are what action could I take and who can I report it to.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there any repercussion for the finance manager for submitting the incorrect income and as a result I could have gotten approved for a loan with a better interest rate since I would not have been denied initially and left with only one approved loan to choose from?

&amp;#x200B;

2. Is the finance manager allowed to submit the credit application and obtain my credit reports on July 1st even though they did not receive signed consent until the following morning?

&amp;#x200B;

3. Is the underwriter allowed to add a zero to the end of my income without verification to finalize the deal for a car that only has 20% left to be paid, but initially received the wrong information from the finance manager of the dealership?

&amp;#x200B;

4. Is the finance manager allowed to submit the credit application and obtain my credit reports on July 6th even though they did not receive signed consent ever and as a result added another credit inquiry to my credit report? Is there any repercussion for an unauthorized credit inquiry? If the finance manager claimed they fixed the error and got a callback on the July 5th about the approval, why was it necessary to make another credit inquiry on July 6th when I met her?

I wanted to get your input on this decision I need to make, I currently have my emergency fund sitting in a Schwab savings account with a .50 return. I've been debating putting the entire emergency fund into a schwab money market fund (SWVXX), which is at 2.2% return now. If I ever need to pull money it takes about 24 hours to pull it from the fund. The other option would be to open an Ally account that currently has a 2.10 interest rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things to consider, its a pain in the ass move funds between banks and schwab has an extra .10 interest rate. Other thing to consider is that while my understanding is that technically the Money Fund from Schwab is not FDIC insured since its technically not savings, while Ally savings account is.",finance
personalfinance,"I know about the debt snowball and the debt waterfall.... Is there a third ""mathematically optimal"" option for my situation?","So I have 10 student loans, all with different principal amounts and different interest rates. My goal is to pay extra towards the loans and get out of debt ASAP.


It worked out so that the loan with lowest principal amount has the highest interest rate, the loan with the highest principal amount has a middle interest rate, a loan with a middle principal amount has the lowest interest  rate, with all my other loans falling in between.


Would it make sense for me to pay minimum payments on all loans and focus all of my extra payment towards the loan that accrues the highest amount of interest every month? That way I can reduce the overall amount I will pay. I know it's not part of the snowball or waterfall methods, but I think it might be mathematically the best option.


I appreciate any input or advice!


Edit - I meant debt Avalanche, not Waterfall!",finance

personalfinance,Received a $200 bill for a routine STD test,"I have Blue Cross Blue Shield federal. I went to my OBGYN for my annual well woman exam. I had a Pap smear and she recommended I get an STD test. I had no reason to believe this wouldn’t be covered by insurance as it is preventative care (or so I thought). I just got a bill from LabCorp saying the test cost $1818, there’s a $1422 “adjustment”, BCBS covered $205 and I owe $192. 

I’m confused as to why this wouldn’t be covered but I don’t assume any of your are insurance experts. My question is who do I contact to figure out if this is legitimate or not? My doctor?  LabCorp? BCBS? Has anyone had a similar experience?

Update: so idk if anyone will even see this update but first, thanks for all the responses. I called BCBS and they were very helpful. They told me the reason my deductible kicked in was because 3 of the tests were coded as non-preventative. She called my doctors office to have the resend with the correct codes, since the tests they ordered were literally all for a normal, annual, well  woman exam. The doctor is only in on Tuesdays so the billing rep will be in contact with me once all the paperwork goes through. So *fingers crossed* everything goes fine and I don’t pay $192!!!!!!! So my advice to everyone is DON’T just pay things thinking they’re correct, have a questioning attitude and always review your bills completely.

personalfinance,Loan servicers changed my due dates for various student loans to this month,"So a little background: 

I graduated in December and I have about $100k in student loan debt. 65k is from private loans, and 35k is from federal loans. Previously I had gotten documentation stating that my private loans (1 and 2) were due 10/2019(1), and 3/20(2). Loan 1 is co-signed with my father, who is having money issues mostly due to his divorce, and needs the loan off of his back asap as it's affecting his ability to take out loans or refinance his mortgage. I know my federal loans were due some time in the fall of 2019, but can't remember the exact date. I make about $1000 bi-weekly, and save about $400 of every paycheck. I have around $5000 saved at this time. I had started making payments on my private loans to pay down interest a couple months ago, as it was the first time it was financially viable.


I happened to check my statement for my private loan this month (they've always been $0, so I don't check them every month. Why would I? They told me when they would be due). This prompted me to also check my federal loans, and lo and behold, they were also suddenly due this month. I was operating under the assumption that these loans weren't due for a while, and was about to pursue a credit building loan this week, as I do not have sufficient credit history to refinance. 


My private loans (1 and 2) are $200 a month with a 9.5% interest rate (v) and $400 a month with a 10% interest rate (v). Before you mention how absurd the interest rates are, they were a line of credit at 6% when I acquired them, and they were my best option at the time for student loans. My federal loan is $350 a month with a ~3.25% interest rate. 


I can adjust my repayment schedule for my federal loans fairly easily, so I'm not worried as much about that one, however the private loans accrue a little under $500 a month in interest. 


I am going to call my private loan servicer tomorrow and 1) ask them why they decided to change my due date with little to no warning, and 2), ask them to lower my interest rate and consolidate the loans as there is literally no way for me to afford these payments. My dad has suggested that I take out a credit building loan at 3% against my balance in savings, and use the loan to pay down the lower of the two loans. He also suggested I take out a personal loan to ""pay"" to purchase my car from him (I bought it, but the title is in his name for insurance purposes) and use the money to also pay the smaller loan down. 


TL;DR: My student loans became due this month despite documentation stating otherwise, the total payment is about $1k a month and I can't afford that. 

Do you guys have any additional suggestions/critiquing of my plan etc? I'm really dumbfounded right now. This isn't how I expected my night to go.",finance
solar,Should I Install Solar Panels on the Roof of My New House?,"Hey everyone! I'm new to all of this, so I could use some advice. I'll start with some background. I'm 22 years old, I bought a foreclosure for 17k and have been fixing it up with my dad. I'm about halfway done, and I've spent about 35-40k so far. The house is going to be a smart house, so it's going to draw a decent amount of power and I like my AC ice cold, and I more than likely will buy an electric vehicle in the next few years, so I figure I'll use quite of electricity.  I was wondering if I should have a solar array installed on my roof. Would installing it ourselves be better? How difficult and dangerous is it? My roof is 23 square and I live in Illinois. All in all, I won't have a ton into the house so I figured adding solar wouldn't be too much of a cost to me considering what I paid for the house. I went on Energysage and got a quote for 21 x 310w panels. A 6.51kW system with a yearly production estimate of 7,769kWh. The upfront cost is $21,750 with a 30-year labor warranty and 12-year inverter warranty. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/HwsHKsc) is the actual quote. I'm wondering if I should buy it upfront, finance it, or save my money. I know the Federal tax incentive and Illinois tax incentives help out a bit. I make around 100k with my job and business a year so paying for it upfront or over a loan wouldn't be a problem for me. I was also wondering if a battery like the Tesla pack would be worth it. If you installed solar, did you regret it or love it? All help is appreciated I'm torn on this one.

* I have 0 loans to pay off, no medical expenses, or anything of the sort
* I currently have around $8,000 saved up in my bank acct.
* I am currently living with my parents and need to move out asap, what is the max I should spend on rent?
* I will be taking over all my own policies (car insurance, wifi, phone bill, etc.) when I move out, what allocation of income typically goes towards bills?
* I spend around $70 a week groceries for myself, so around 6.5% of net income
* I desperately need a new car. Looking to sell my current one I don’t expect to get more than \~$2,500 for it. What’s appropriate to spend to lease? Or do I wait a few months and buy outright?
* I spend around $50 every 2 weeks on gas or \~2.5% of net income
* I spend around $50 a month on personal care items or \~1% of net income
* Company 401k match is 50% of contributions up to 6% of salary, but not until 6 months have passed.

* How much should be allocated for an emergency fund? Is that even necessary for me at this time?

I'm getting through it alright except for one thing.

Under the State W-4 tax data section, one question asks about ""additional state withholding."" It says in order to calculate this section, I need to divide the amount of the expected balance due on my tax return by the number of pay periods in a year.

Forgive my ignorance, I'm new to this world... How do I figure out how much to withhold from my state income?

For federal, given by salary, the W-4's ""guide"" (whatever you'd call it) is suggesting I withhold $280.00 from each paycheck.

But there's no guide or step-by-step instructions for figuring out how much to withhold at the state income level.

personalfinance,School reimbursement investment,"Need some advice on what to do. Before reading this isn’t going to be some crazy post where I’m 18 with a job that pays 300k a year. This is a very modest scenario that I could really use good advice on.

My job is currently offering $2,500 yearly reimbursement on college tuition. My college tuition is around $5,000 a semester. I am going purely on federal loans. Receiving $6,500 a semester (returning the left over $1,500. Will pay for books, supplies, etc out of pocket). So essentially 1/4th of my school is covered a year. However, I’m caught between these two options:

Option A.) I take the $2,500 reimbursement and throw it right back to federal loan, so basically I’m only borrowing $2,500 from them.

Option B.) Keep the reimbursement of 2,500 and put it into some sort of account that will gain interest and then once graduated and interest has been building for a while, pull it out and whack down my loans a decent bit. 

I have about 3 years of school left. I could potentially take some summer/winter courses to make it about 2.5 years but we’ll leave that out of this scenario.

personalfinance,Question about fixed-rate investments in the current market: Bonds vs CDs vs High Interest Savings,"Hi PF

I'm thinking about where to put a bit of cash (for backup/safety purposes) in the current market.  Most Bond ETFs have dividend yields &lt;3% right now, but there are CDs and savings accounts (Wealthfront?) that offer similar yields.

I have a few questions on the topic:

1. What is the logic of putting money into a bond ETF?  Are you really just happy to get that 3% yield, or are you hoping the price will jump during a recession?  Can someone point me to a bond ETF or index that shows bond prices jumping during those times?  I've looked at a few that extend through recessions and I basically see a smooth curve, but maybe I'm not looking at the right thing.  I understand that the interest rate might increase in the future, but I don't need to have my money in an ETF right now to take advantage of that.

2. Aside from liquidity, why would I prefer to put money in a bond ETF instead of a high yield CD?

3. Is Wealthfront a scam or do they really have FDIC insurance?  Where can I find that on the FDIC website?  I see it on the Wealthfront website but I'm wary of things on the internet (I'm not going to give them a bunch of money just because they say it's safe).

solar,Monitoring system RS-485 RJ-45 signal pinout?,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I have an ""Energy Collect Device"" (ECD) delivered as part of my PV system. 

This outputs an RS-485 signal on an RJ-45 connector. This signal is supposed to be fed into a Wi-Fi RTU unit, which sendt the collected production data to a web page (or an app).

My problem here is the cable between the ECD and the RTU. I have no idea which pin is supplying the required signals, or earth. I have googled up and down the known internet, I have tried about a billion different combinations. I have tried with and without a 120 ohm resistor, and about every other possible solution.

Attached is a picture of the ECD and the iPad that is showing the app with the reported production. The ECD is supplied as a loose item without any cables or user manual. Really shit...

I have built the system myself, so I have no supplier or anyone else to just tell to fix it :(

This is just a small system to get some background data on realistic PV performance. If this turns out to be good shit (located in Norway), then I will go ahead and install a total of 50+ panels on various roofs. But I need the data to be able to calculate realistic ROI.

If I am not able to get the ECD to report to the web page, I have to actually find another device that supports my micro inverters. :(

&amp;#x200B;

Any good ideas on how to connect the cable? Or do I actually have to bring out an osciloscope and start measuring?

Once I graduate the avg salary in NYC (where I plan on working) is roughly 130,000 (not including almost guaranteed overtime). Part time work is highly discouraged. There is no option to spread out the classes over a longer period of time.
2. I've already exhausted the max amount of federal aid/loans and it will cover my tuition with just a few thousand left over. So, I will need to take out loans for living expenses...
3. The main reason I will need to exercise the option to take out private loans for living expenses is because I am in a pretty serious relationship. My girlfriend and I have been together for a few years and  living together for over a year. Where we live now, her commute is already 1.5 hours and moving any closer to my school would make it even longer for her. Right now my commute would also come to 1.5 hours. She is a nurse and works 12 hour shifts so i feel bad making her move any further away from work than I already have.
4. We live in Long Island City NY which is a pretty expensive area especially since I need to be as close to public transportation as possible.
5. Icing on the cake... I have 16k in credit card debt. Is there any scenario in which taking out private loans to get rid of this debt and future interest accruals would be advisable?
6. Living with my parents is an option since they are very close to the school but this would limit the time I get to spend with my girlfriend to almost nothing.

solar,Little over a year on solar and could not be happier!,"Attaching a picture of my power produced  on a 6.54kW system along with my electric bills (We're on Clay Electric in Florida). Pictures speak a thousand words and I just wanted to show how nice it is not to have an electric bill for most of the year! The $28 fee is the ""Access Charge"" of $23 and what Clay charges our subdivision for lighting. Everyone else is paying that as well, I just consider that the cost of renting them as a battery for our night time electric use at this point in time. Eight years left and the system will have paid for itself compared against what we were paying for electric in 2018, add to that, electric is going up again around here so that will make this system in reality pay for itself faster compared to the new rates, our rates are locked in, and that is a beautiful thing. I just had to share this in case anyone is out there considering solar. This is the last year that they are giving the full solar rebate on the federal level (30% tax credit) so if you were considering, now is the time!

&amp;#x200B;

Warning, rant\* -  If our Florida legislators were more household/family friendly for home solar we would not have had a bill at all in Jan and Feb - we had enough hours banked to get us through the winter, however, our meter was reset and we were paid a pittance, if they paid us what was in our KWH Credits Earned bank what they charge us for electric we would have made money! That said, I would absolutely still put solar up again anywhere we live that I can, and I think once power battery banks become better priced, we will be completely free of power bills in the future.

This is my forever home so that time frame is fine and with interest rates so low I don't know if they'll be a better time.

Home value: $220-240k

Current mortgage: 125,500 at 3.75% on a 30 year (27 years remaining)

New mortgage: 133,100 at 2.75% on a 15 year

Here is the loan estimate but there are a few caveats and questions:  [https://imgur.com/a/o325Ooj](https://imgur.com/a/o325Ooj)

1. Appraisal has since been waived so -$445 off the closing cost.
2. Question regarding escrow (G) Since I will be getting a refund check of my escrow from my existing loan, would I effectively subtract my refund amount from my closing costs to get the true closing cost value?

Because I don't completely understand points I've been using the following calculation:  [https://imgur.com/a/DWoGPjD](https://imgur.com/a/DWoGPjD)

1. The $6,282 value of entire closing costs for the calculation is derived from the total closing costs from my loan estimate minus the appraisal fee elimination and assumed escrow refund (1,000 to be conservative.)
2. That turns out to be 7,727 - 445 - 1000 = 6,282

personalfinance,Need help figuring out how to structure a loan from parents.,"I'm getting ready to purchase a property in the next week that needs some work to have it ready.  I have the downpayment and closing costs all covered myself.  There are some repairs that need to be made that I can't afford right now but I make enough that if I had another year to save there would be no issue.  My parents know this and to assist me they are planning on taking out a HELOC loan for about $20k that I plan to repay them in the next 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

They are doing this strictly to help me out and not trying to make any money off me so I want to make sure this is structured properly.  Things I've been considering:

* They will have interest from the HELOC that I obviously want to cover for them so their loan to me doesn't cost them anything.
* I was planning to save up and just pay them a large lump when I have the money; however, I can alter this and pay throughout if necessary.  I am expecting to have enough to pay them off in 1-2 years without stretching myself thin at all.
* The property is going to be a duplex that I owner occupy so I don't want them to simply pay for the work I need themselves so that way I can write it off as an expense at the end of the year.  This is why I need them to transfer the money to me first and then I would pay with that money.

I've been doing research and know that anything over $14k needs to be structured as a loan with an interest rate and everything.  Basically my goal is to minimize how much myself and my parents spend to make this happen and also make sure that there is no tax issue that could come back to bite me (they're also doing me a huge favor so I don't want this to be any more complicated for them than it needs to be).

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if anyone has done anything similar before or has an idea how to make this work the simplest and most efficient way possible but any advice would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,How to effectively prioritize personal finance goals?,"My spouse and I are in our late 20s and attempting to get a handle on our financial well-being after years of mediocre financial behavior. We both come from wonderful middle-class families who unfortunately did not teach us financial fundamentals or prioritize financial health. We don't have any ""adults"" who we feel comfortable asking for advice on how to prioritize all of the financial challenges/milestones that come with adulthood.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary of our current situation:

* Income: spouse works full time ($83k before taxes, 401k and HSA) and I am in grad school ($25k stipend, starting last month) with one year left (no additional student loans).
* Debts: Car (\~$5k left, 2.4% interest); spouse undergrad loan ($16k left, \~1% interest); spouse grad loan ($24k left, 0% interest personal loan)
* Major monthly expenses: $1.3k rent, $839 student loans; $800 for household expenses (food, hygiene/cleaning, prescriptions, and pet); $300 for spending/hobby money, $219 car loan; $200 utilities; $130 cell phones; $500 to liquid savings.
* Recent milestones: We recently used much of our savings to pay off my undergrad student loan (freed up $400 per month); currently have $20k left in savings as an emergency fund (about 5 months of expenses); \~$60k in 401k; both of us have credit in the high 700s/low 800s.
* We are childfree and plan to remain so.

&amp;#x200B;

Financial Goals:

* buy or build a house in the next few years *(We would like to stay in the area after I finish grad school. Home and rent prices are continuing to increase quite a bit (Raleigh-Durham). We initially were hoping to wait for a downturn in the real estate market, but we are beginning to realize trying to time the market is probably a poor choice; we would like to keep house price &lt;$250k; we would like to eventually retire in this house)*
* purchase a second car next year when I graduate  *(likely \~$15k, we would get the same used car we currently have; we would consider another auto loan with our current lender);*
* become debt-free
* not touch our e-fund for any of our goals; continue living on one income for foreseeable future and save majority of the other salary

&amp;#x200B;

We had designed our budget to live on one income, and we now will have a little bit more breathing room with my $25k stipend. I also anticipate earning $50-$60k after graduation.  I've been attempting to model different scenarios in my spreadsheets, but our own lack of knowledge and the number of assumptions build in way too much uncertainty.  How do we know how to prioritize our goals to optimize our future?  How do we allocate this money to achieve our goals most effectively?

&amp;#x200B;

Questions/Scenarios:

* Do we aggressively snowball our current debt like Dave Ramsey would suggest and then save later?
* Do we save up to buy our second car in cash rather than taking on an additional auto loan?
* Do we aggressively save for a house downpayment to lock in currently-low interest rates despite potentially elevated home prices?
* Since our debt interest rates are fairly low, does it really matter the order we approach these major goals?
* How important is it to have 20+% saved for a downpayment? Would it be better to keep saving for a 20% downpayment even if it takes a few years, or do we pull the trigger with \~10% and deal with a few years of PMI?
* Are there any indicators you suggest we look for in determining when is a good time to buy a house? We are sick of moving to avoid ever-increasing rent prices (moved 5 times in the last 6 years) and really want to get settled; however, we are extremely concerned about potentially buying at the top of a really elevated housing market this far into the economic recovery after the last downturn. Is there any data to reconcile these two conflicting feelings we have or point us in the right direction? Does timing even matter if we hopefully plan to retire in this house anyway?

&amp;#x200B;

What would you do if you were in our position? Any insight on how to approach our situation would be extremely helpful. We are feeling very adrift and like we don't really know where to start.",finance

personalfinance,Selling car to pay off debts! But which debts first?,"Greetings all. I need a little help figuring out the best scenario to help pay down my debts. I've decided to part ways with my car and sell it off of Craigslist where I think I'll be making $4,500. I already have a buyer lined up for this evening so hopefully all will go as planned. Fortunately I will not need to buy another vehicle anytime soon because my parents are lending me their old Volvo. I also commute each day via the train, so I really only need a car on the weekends.  
Anyhow, here is the current debt situation I am in. The combination of a personal loan to fund a kitchen renovation and  poor credit card habits has gotten me into about $16,660 in debt total.   
**Here's the breakdown:**  
Credit Card #1 - **$2279 w/ 22.24% APR**  
Credit Card #2 - **$6663 w/ 18.74% APR**  
Kitchen Renovation Loan - **$7716 w/ 10.99% APR fixed**

Would you recommend me to pay off Credit Card #1 first entirely, and then the rest towards Credit Card #2? Or should I stash perhaps $1,000 aside for a security savings, and then put the rest towards Credit Card #2. I definitely think paying down the highest interest rate card would be the wisest move, so then I can just focus on slowly paying off the other one. Sort of like the snowball strategy.

btc,"The real problem with BTC, as I see it.","In 2017 when fees were skyrocketing with the price, things got strange. Then a proposal was made by and agreed to by some of the most highly regarded persons in the community. Segwit 2X, they called it. I learned about what the proposal, with 90%+ support, entailed. A little bit for both sides of the scaling debate. Sounds good. But what about this SegWit/2nd layer thing? Oh, coins sent to another network and settled back to the main chain when they're ready. Or never. Maybe they can do fractional reserve. Maybe they can inflate the supply. The inflation game lasted a long time for the current money controllers. If people were confused about the federal reserve, how are they going to know what's going on with their world wide digital ledger? At that time, Bitcoins blockchain was simple enough to understand, even if I couldn't code. (Except cnc. Irrelevant.) But with proprietary side chains, how could I possibly keep track of the stability and trustworthiness of this money system? The simplicity of the blockchain before August 2017 was my biggest interest. That was a ledger I could trust. Sound money. 

Looking back now, I wonder if anyone else felt this way or if it was only about throughput for the big blockers. Throughput was critical but not the thing that amazed me about Bitcoin in the first place. I think my comment which got me banned was ""NoS"". BCH is still pretty great for its simplicity and ease of use. I hope it can stay that way. That is what will keep me using (not holding) this money.  The money that gets used will be the money that has value, true. But will that money be used because it provides value or for some other reason? Do people feel the need to understand the fundamentals of their money, or are the big money figures, lenders, bankers, CEOs, CTOs, developers and other technicians ""the smartest guys in the room"" and therefore: trustworthy?

personalfinance,Advice for settlement money,"Throwaway account for personal reasons. 

Location: United States

My wife and I are soon to receive an insurance settlement ($75k) and would like advice on how to best utilize this money. We have a substantial amount of debt and would like to payoff things like our credit cards that have a hefty monthly payment but are unsure about the other debts.

Background: 

\-We have one child, 6 months old

\-We own our condo which we've been in for 2 years, currently paying PMI with a balance of approx 150k on the principal.

\-We each have CC balances totaling $23,500

\-2 car notes totaling $18,250

\-Home improvement loan balance of $7400

\-2 private student loans totaling $7200 (there are federal loans too but we are enrolled in the Fed's debt forgiveness program)

&amp;#x200B;

Question is, which of these loans should we prioritize, or should we just pay them all off (not including the mortgage)? I feel like we should pay off all of the CC, private loans, and home improvement loan but I am unsure if we should pay off the cars as well? We have a good interest rate on each vehicle loan and I wonder if we invested this money instead of paying off the cars if we could get more out of our money. Are there other things I'm not taking into consideration? 

This is a significant amount of money that could really change our lives if we handle it correctly. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",finance

According to the IRS withholding calculator, if I change nothing I'll be overpaying my taxes by $3391. So it says I should switch to 8 allowances which means no federal taxes would be withheld. (Apparently the $2807 satisfies my federal taxes owed which should be $2653).

Does that all seem correct? 8 allowances seems like an absurd number.

personalfinance,Pause 401K and savings growth for debt repayment?,"Hello personal finance community!

I have a *somewhat* unique situation that I wanted feedback on. While some generic answers comparing interest rates/investment return rates may help certain parts of this question, I wanted to lay out the particulars and see what you all thought. Hopefully this does not break any submission rules.  

* Age: 22
* Salary: $40,560
* 401K current balance and contribution: $12,500 current, 12 percent (2 percent match by employer)
* Net income: $2,318 per month
* Expenses, monthly: $980 rent, $50 Verizon, 10% tithe, $300 food, $300 transport, $20-$50 misc. 
* Debts: $9200 student loan ($96 minimum monthly currently in progress), $220 phone ($56 minimum monthly almost paid off)
* Saving: $2,500

I had a thought that for 2020 I wanted to sprint for 12 months to get as close to paying off all my debts as I could. 

This would result in me dropping the 401K balance down to the 2% contribution simply to max out the employer match and putting it toward the loan. 

It would look like this:

* Net monthly income: 2,590 per month
* $100 that was already going to the minimum per month
* $100 per month that I was putting in savings
* $270 difference in net income due to 401K contribution 
* $100 of extra cash of my own to put in

This, over 12 months, would be a bit short of the balance of the loan at $6,840

Income breakdown would be over the course of a month:
* 250 tithe
* 980 rent
* 150 grocery
* 150 eating out
* 300 transport
* 50 verizon
* 10 misc
* 10 gym
* 20 laundry
* 70 spending
* 570 in loan breakdown above

That equals 2560, leaving 30 bucks or so for wiggle room if something minor comes up that I don’t need to use savings for.

personalfinance,Financially trapped in an abusive household,"Firstly, I’d like to clarify that I’m writing on behalf of a dear friend of mine. She does know that I am posting here; I did ask her first. However, she asked me to use an alternate name, so we’ll call her Jess. Before I jump into this post I have to say that Jess is genuinely a kind soul. She’s the type of person who tries as hard as she can to stay happy and cheery on the outside in order to light up the faces of those around her. Everywhere she goes she makes friends, and she is loved dearly by many around her, including her teachers, best friends, and their parents. She isn’t what you would call a “rebellious problem child”; she doesn’t drink or do drugs, despite that being the norm for people who have similar histories as her. 

The main issue in this post is that Jess has been accepted to UT but cannot pay for it. Unfortunately, Jess rolled a 1 for family. Her biological father physically abused her as a child and her parents went through a nasty divorce, with her and the other children at the center of the issue. There are so many issues with the parents it’s ridiculous- but I’ll stick with the most important ones. They won’t contribute a penny to her education- not the most outrageous on its own, but considering the fact that the father works a very, very high paying job at a hospital, and the fact that it’s clear the family spends money extremely irresponsibly and in a carefree manner, it’s almost laughable when they tell her “they have better things to spend their money on.” In addition, another reason the father cites for not helping is that “he went to college all on his own, too”. Well, the difference there is that he got everything funded by FAFSA. He didn’t have to take any loans. Jess doesn’t get any money from FAFSA because of the father’s high paying job. 

“But Jess, why don’t you file as an independent so you can get all that FAFSA money too?” Believe me, if she could leave that house, she would’ve, in an instant. Her parents have driven her to this several times- she reached a point where she could not take the emotional abuse, so she left. See, Jess was diagnosed with severe PTSD at age 17, which was induced by the years of trauma induced by her biological father. She was r\*\*\*d 3 times as a child, and once more at age 17, and heavily abused by her father as a child. Anyway, the reason she is stuck is because she is on her father’s insurance plan, which allows her to get the medication, therapy, and treatment she needs to stay alive and mentally grounded for free. The combined cost of this medication, according to Jess, is upwards of 100k a year, so she would be losing money and her health would suffer greatly.

The insurance is the trump card that allows her parents to essentially make her do whatever they want. They’ve threatened to take away the insurance before if she ever left again, so now she has to endure every shitty thing they do to her. I can sit here and rant about all the things they do that would qualify them to be the world's worst parents for ages, but for time’s sake, ill list the important ones. 

They blame her for getting r\*\*\*d

They constantly do things that trigger her PTSD flashbacks despite constant warnings from her therapist and Jess herself

They won’t let her leave the house and sometimes go to school because they need her to take care of THEIR kids(age 2 and 4)

They refuse to take care of their kids and place all the burden on Jess

They always yell at them for little reason, or overreact to small things

She has a suspicion they won't help her with anything so she has to stay at home and take care of the kids, since it’s convenient for them

They never allowed her to get a job K-12 because they told her she needed to take care of the kids

They disregard and belittle her problems and concerns and medical needs, sometimes withholding medicine or refusing to take her to the doctor

They frequently go partying or doing things for fun while Jess is stuck at home

She can’t leave and yet she has to- she says she can’t take another year and she’s well past the breaking point. Her parents won’t pay for her schooling. She can’t leave Austin, because that’s where all her therapists and doctors are. She desperately wants to go to UT- it’s been her dream since forever- so she wants to get a loan for her tuition and room and board(she is only receiving 2,750 dollar per semester through unsubsidized and subsidized federal loans). But, her parents just dropped it on her that they don’t want to cosign a loan either, even though it wouldn’t exactly be financially dangerous for them. They reason that “they could lose their house” they co-signed.

She hasnt been sitting idly. Jess also works a job now since she is 18. She recently applied for and got a credit card too, and is in the process of building credit. She's applied to 17 scholarships and counting.

So what now, reddit? It’s tricky, because leaving that house is turning into an absolute necessity in order to preserve her health. UT really seems like the way out right now- education is the path to self sustenance. It’s been her dream since she was a child, and I’m positive she can excel with the resources and support that UT has to offer. She spent a year at a community college to save money, and did well in all her classes. She was also accepted to UT in the first wave of one of the most competitive majors at UT. Whatever way you look at it, she is a fantastic student, and I know that if she was at a place where she felt safe, in a non-hostile living arrangement, she would do even better.

It really pains me to see this happen to truly, one of the best, most positive, resilient people I know. It’s just unfair that someone like her could do so many good things and make so many people happy and yet still continue to be let down time after time, so I’m reaching out in the hope that even something little might help. She doesn’t know what to do and we’re struggling to keep hope that a light might finally shine in this dark situation. Any advice on what to do? And if not, a few kind words would make her day.

We are aware that if we had seen this coming, she would have acted much quicker. We aren't really looking for comments on what she could've or should've done earlier, but rather, what her options are now. 

Thank you for reading, reddit! Please help, it would go really far for her to see even a little bit of support or advice, or just to know that someone cares. 

Tldr: friend must leave home, as it is essential to her mental health. Friend is stuck at home because of dependence on family's health insurance plan. Friend wants to go to UT, but needs a loan or money.",finance

Joint Statement on Broker-Dealer Custody of Digital Asset Securities,"Source:  [https://www.finra.org/newsroom/2019/joint-statement-broker-dealer-custody-digital-asset-securities](https://www.finra.org/newsroom/2019/joint-statement-broker-dealer-custody-digital-asset-securities) 

# Joint Statement on Broker-Dealer Custody of Digital Asset Securities

WASHINGTON – Market participants have raised questions concerning the application of the federal securities laws and the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) to the potential intermediation—including custody—of digital asset securities1 and transactions. In this statement, the staffs of the Division of Trading and Markets (the “Division”) and FINRA (collectively, the “Staffs”)—drawing upon key principles from their historic approach to broker-dealer regulation and investor protection—have articulated various considerations relevant to many of these questions, particularly under the SEC’s Customer Protection Rule applicable to SEC-registered broker-dealers.2

As a threshold matter, it should be recognized by market participants that the application of the federal securities laws, FINRA rules and other bodies of laws to digital assets, digital asset securities and related innovative technologies raise novel and complex regulatory and compliance questions and challenges. For example, and as discussed in more detail below, the ability of a broker-dealer to comply with aspects of the Customer Protection Rule is greatly facilitated by established laws and practices regarding the loss or theft of a security, that may not be available or effective in the case of certain digital assets.

The Staffs are aware of, and encourage and support, efforts to address these issues such that compliance with the Customer Protection Rule and other federal securities laws and FINRA rules is reasonably practicable. In recent months, the Staffs have been engaged with industry participants regarding how industry participants believe a particular custody solution for digital asset securities would meet the possession or control standards prescribed in the SEC’s Customer Protection Rule. The Staffs have found these discussions to be very informative and appreciate market participants’ ongoing engagement on these issues. The Staffs encourage and support innovation and look forward to continuing our dialogue as market participants work toward developing methodologies for establishing possession or control over customers’ digital asset securities. Contact information for Commission and FINRA staffs is provided at the end of this statement.

**Importance of the Customer Protection Rule**

Entities seeking to participate in the marketplace for digital asset securities must comply with the relevant securities laws.3 An entity that buys, sells, or otherwise transacts or is involved in effecting transactions in digital asset securities for customers or its own account is subject to the federal securities laws, and may be required to register with the Commission as a broker-dealer and become a member of and comply with the rules of a self-regulatory organization (“SRO”), which in most cases is FINRA. Importantly, if the entity is a broker-dealer, it must comply with broker-dealer financial responsibility rules,4 including, as applicable, custodial requirements under Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), which is known as the Customer Protection Rule.

The purpose of the Customer Protection Rule is to safeguard customer securities and funds held by a broker-dealer, to prevent investor loss or harm in the event of a broker-dealer’s failure, and to enhance the Commission’s ability to monitor and prevent unsound business practices. Put simply, the Customer Protection Rule requires broker-dealers to safeguard customer assets and to keep customer assets separate from the firm’s assets, thus increasing the likelihood that customers’ securities and cash can be returned to them in the event of the broker-dealer’s failure. The requirements of the Customer Protection Rule have produced a nearly fifty year track record5 of recovery for investors when their broker-dealers have failed. This record of protecting customer assets held in custody by broker-dealers stands in contrast to recent reports of cybertheft,6 and underscores the need to ensure broker-dealers’ robust protection of customer assets, including digital asset securities.

Various unregistered entities that intend to engage in broker-dealer activities involving digital asset securities are seeking to register with the Commission and have submitted New Membership Applications (“NMAs”) to FINRA. Additionally, various entities that are already registered broker-dealers and FINRA members are seeking to expand their businesses to include digital asset securities services and activities. Under FINRA rules, a firm is prohibited from materially changing its business operations (*e.g.*, engaging in material digital asset securities activities for the first time) without FINRA’s prior approval of a Continuing Membership Application (“CMA”).7

The NMAs and CMAs currently before FINRA are diverse: Some of the NMAs and CMAs cover proposed business models that would not involve the broker-dealer engaging in custody of digital asset securities. On the other hand, some NMAs and CMAs include the custodying of digital asset securities, and therefore implicate the Customer Protection Rule, among other requirements.

Some of these entities have met with the Staffs to discuss how they propose to custody digital asset securities in order to comply with the broker-dealer financial responsibility rules. These discussions have been informative. The specific circumstances where a broker-dealer could custody digital asset securities in a manner that the Staffs believe would comply with the Customer Protection Rule remain under discussion, and the Staffs stand ready to continue to engage with entities pursuing this line of business.

**Noncustodial Broker-Dealer Models for Digital Asset Securities**

As noted, some entities contemplate engaging in broker-dealer activities involving digital asset securities that would not involve the broker-dealer engaging in custody functions. Generally speaking, noncustodial activities involving digital asset securities do not raise the same level of concern among the Staffs, provided that the relevant securities laws, SRO rules, and other legal and regulatory requirements are followed.8The following are examples of some of the business activities of this type that have been presented or described to the Staffs.

* One example is where the broker-dealer sends the trade-matching details (*e.g*., identity of the parties, price, and quantity) to the buyer and issuer of a digital asset security—similar to a traditional private placement—and the issuer settles the transaction bilaterally between the buyer and issuer, away from the broker-dealer. In this case, the broker-dealer instructs the customer to pay the issuer directly and instructs the issuer to issue the digital asset security to the customer directly (*e.g.*, the customer’s “digital wallet”).
* A second example is where a broker-dealer facilitates “over-the counter” secondary market transactions in digital asset securities without taking custody of or exercising control over the digital asset securities. In this example, the buyer and seller complete the transaction directly and, therefore, the securities do not pass through the broker-dealer facilitating the transaction.
* Another example is where a secondary market transaction involves a broker-dealer introducing a buyer to a seller of digital asset securities through a trading platform where the trade is settled directly between the buyer and seller. For instance, a broker-dealer that operates an alternative trading system (“ATS”) could match buyers and sellers of digital asset securities and the trades would either be settled directly between the buyer and seller, or the buyer and seller would give instructions to their respective custodians to settle the transactions.9 In either case, the ATS would not guarantee or otherwise have responsibility for settling the trades and would not at any time exercise any level of control over the digital asset securities being sold or the cash being used to make the purchase (*e.g*., the ATS would not place a temporary hold on the seller’s wallet or on the buyer’s cash to ensure the transaction is completed).

**Considerations for Broker-Dealer Custody of Digital Asset Securities**

Whether a security is paper or digital, the same fundamental elements of the broker-dealer financial responsibility rules apply. The Staffs acknowledge that market participants wishing to custody digital asset securities may find it challenging to comply with the broker-dealer financial responsibility rules without putting in place significant technological enhancements and solutions unique to digital asset securities. As the market, infrastructure, and law applicable to digital asset securities continue to develop, the Staffs will continue their constructive engagement with market participants and to gather additional information so that they may better respond to developments in the market10while advancing the missions of our respective organizations: for the SEC, to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation; and for FINRA, to provide investor protection and promote market integrity.

**The Customer Protection Rule**

***Overview***

A broker-dealer seeking to custody digital asset securities must comply with the Customer Protection Rule. As noted, the rule is designed principally to protect customers of a registered broker-dealer from losses and delays in accessing their securities and cash that can occur if the firm fails. The rule requires the broker-dealer to safeguard customer securities and cash entrusted to the firm, as discussed below. If the broker-dealer fails, customer securities and cash should be readily available to be returned to customers.11 In the event the broker-dealer were to be liquidated under SIPA, the SIPA trustee would be expected to step into the shoes of the broker-dealer and expected to be able to transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of assets in accordance with SIPA.12

Among its core protections for customers, Rule 15c3-3 requires a broker-dealer to physically hold customers’ fully paid and excess margin securities or maintain them free of lien at a good control location.13 Generally, a broker-dealer may custody customer securities with a third-party custodian (*e.g*., the Depository Trust Company or a clearing bank),14 and uncertificated securities, such as mutual funds, may be held at the issuer or at the issuer’s transfer agent.15 In either case, there is a third party that controls the transfer of the securities. This traditional securities infrastructure (including, for example, related laws of property and security) also has processes to reverse or cancel mistaken or unauthorized transactions.

***Considerations for Digital Asset Securities***

There are many significant differences in the mechanics and risks associated with custodying traditional securities and digital asset securities. For instance, the manner in which digital asset securities are issued, held, and transferred may create greater risk that a broker-dealer maintaining custody of them could be victimized by fraud or theft, could lose a “private key” necessary to transfer a client’s digital asset securities, or could transfer a client’s digital asset securities to an unknown or unintended address without meaningful recourse to invalidate fraudulent transactions, recover or replace lost property, or correct errors. Consequently, a broker-dealer must consider how it can, in conformance with Rule 15c3-3, hold in possession or control digital asset securities.

In particular, a broker-dealer may face challenges in determining that it, or its third-party custodian, maintains custody of digital asset securities.16 If, for example, the broker-dealer holds a private key, it may be able to transfer such securities reflected on the blockchain or distributed ledger. However, the fact that a broker-dealer (or its third party custodian) maintains the private key may not be sufficient evidence by itself that the broker-dealer has exclusive control of the digital asset security (*e.g*., it may not be able to demonstrate that no other party has a copy of the private key and could transfer the digital asset security without the broker-dealer’s consent).17 In addition, the fact that the broker-dealer (or custodian) holds the private key may not be sufficient to allow it to reverse or cancel mistaken or unauthorized transactions. These risks could cause securities customers to suffer losses, with corresponding liabilities for the broker-dealer, imperiling the firm, its customers, and other creditors.

**The Books and Records and Financial Reporting Rules**

***Overview***

The broker-dealer recordkeeping and reporting rules18 require a broker-dealer, among other things, to make and keep current ledgers reflecting all assets and liabilities,19 as well as a securities record reflecting each security carried by the broker-dealer for its customers and all differences determined by the count of customer securities in the broker-dealer’s possession or control compared to the result of the count with the broker-dealer’s existing books and records.20 The financial responsibility rules also require that broker-dealers routinely prepare financial statements,21 including various supporting schedules particular to broker-dealers, such as Computation of Net Capital under Rule 15c3-1 and Information Relating to the Possession or Control Requirements under Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act.22

The books, records, and financial reporting requirements are designed to ensure that a broker-dealer makes and maintains certain business records to assist the firm in accounting for its activities. These rules also assist securities regulators in examining for compliance with the federal securities laws and as such are an integral part of the financial responsibility program for broker-dealers.

***Considerations for Digital Asset Securities***

The nature of distributed ledger technology, as well as the characteristics associated with digital asset securities, may make it difficult for a broker-dealer to evidence the existence of digital asset securities for the purposes of the broker-dealer’s regulatory books, records, and financial statements, including supporting schedules. The broker-dealer’s difficulties in evidencing the existence of these digital asset securities may in turn create challenges for the broker-dealer’s independent auditor seeking to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence when testing management’s assertions in the financial statements during the annual broker-dealer audit.23 We understand that some firms are considering the use of distributed ledger technology with features designed to enable firms to meet recordkeeping obligations and facilitate prompt verification of digital asset security positions (*e.g*., regulatory nodes or permissioned distributed ledger technologies). Broker-dealers should consider how the nature of the technology may impact their ability to comply with the broker-dealer recordkeeping and reporting rules.

**Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970**

***Overview***

Generally, a broker-dealer that fails and is unable to return the customer property that it holds would be liquidated in accordance with SIPA. Under SIPA, securities customers have a first priority claim to cash and securities held by the firm for securities customers. Customers also are eligible for up to $500,000 in protection (of which up to $250,000 can be used for cash claims) if the broker-dealer is missing customer assets. These SIPA protections apply to a “security” as defined in SIPA and cash deposited with the broker-dealer for the purpose of purchasing securities.24 They do not apply to other types of assets, including, importantly, assets that are securities under the federal securities laws but are excluded from the definition of “security” under SIPA.25

***Considerations for Digital Asset Securities***

In the case of a digital asset security that does not meet the definition of “security” under SIPA, and in the event of the failure of a carrying broker-dealer, SIPA protection likely would not apply and holders of those digital asset securities would have only unsecured general creditor claims against the broker-dealer’s estate.26 Further, uncertainty regarding when and whether a broker-dealer holds a digital asset security in its possession or control creates greater risk for customers that their securities will not be able to be returned in the event of a broker-dealer failure.27 The Staffs believe that such potential outcomes are likely to be inconsistent with the expectations of persons who would use a broker-dealer to custody their digital asset securities.

**Control Location Applications**

As a related matter, the Staffs have received inquiries from broker-dealers, including ATSs, wishing to utilize an issuer or transfer agent as a proposed “control location” for purposes of the possession or control requirements under the Customer Protection Rule. As described to the Staffs, this would involve uncertificated securities where the issuer or a transfer agent maintains a traditional single master security holder list, but also publishes as a courtesy the ownership record using distributed ledger technology. While the issuer or transfer agent may publish the distributed ledger, in these examples, the broker-dealers have asserted that the distributed ledger is not the authoritative record of share ownership. To the extent a broker-dealer contemplates an arrangement of this type, the Division will consider whether the issuer or the transfer agent can be considered a satisfactory control location pursuant to an application under paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 15c3-3.28

As noted, the Staffs encourage and support innovation in the securities markets and look forward to continuing to engage with investors and industry participants as the marketplace for digital asset securities develops.  To contact Commission staff for assistance, please visit the Commission’s [FinHub](https://www.sec.gov/finhub) webpage or contact Thomas K. McGowan, Associate Director, at (202) 551-5521 or Raymond Lombardo, Assistant Director, at (202) 551-5755.

1 For the purposes of this statement, the term “digital asset” refers to an asset that is issued and transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology, including, but not limited to, so-called “virtual currencies,” “coins,” and “tokens.” A digital asset may or may not meet the definition of a “security” under the federal securities laws. For the purposes of this statement, a digital asset that is a security is referred to as a “digital asset security.”

2 This statement represents staff views of the Division of Trading and Markets and FINRA. This statement is not a rule, regulation, guidance, or statement of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) or FINRA, and the Commission and FINRA’s Board have neither approved nor disapproved its content. This statement does not alter or amend applicable law and has no legal force or effect.

3 For purposes of this statement, the Staffs use the term “entities” to refer to both firms and individuals.

4 The financial responsibility rules include Rule 15c3-1 (the net capital rule), Rule 15c3-3 (the customer protection rule), Rule 17a-3 (the record making rule), Rule 17a-4 (the record retention rule), Rule 17a-5 (the financial reporting rule), and Rule 17a-13 (the quarterly securities count rule) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). This statement does not address all federal securities laws that may be implicated by a broker-dealer seeking to maintain custody of digital asset securities. Further, this statement does not address other securities laws or rules that may apply to digital asset securities.

5 Rule 15c3-3 was adopted by the Commission in 1972. See Broker-Dealers; Maintenance of Certain Basic Reserves, Exchange Act Release No. 9856 (Nov. 10, 1972), 37 Fed. Reg. 25224 (Nov. 29, 1972).

6 For example, one blockchain forensic analysis firm estimated that approximately $1.7 billion worth of bitcoin and other digital assets had been stolen in 2018, of which approximately $950 million resulted from cyberattacks on bitcoin trading platforms. The estimate of total losses in 2018 is 3.6 times higher than the estimate of such losses in 2017. See CipherTrace, Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report, 2018 Q4, at 3 (Jan. 2019) (available at: [https://ciphertrace.com/crypto-aml-report-2018q4/](https://ciphertrace.com/crypto-aml-report-2018q4/)).

7 Firms can discuss with FINRA whether a contemplated change in business operations such as engaging in digital asset securities activities may require the filing of a CMA through the materiality consultation process.

8 These business models and transactions must comply with other provisions of the securities laws or regulations. The Staffs offer no views about whether such business models would be in compliance with other securities laws or regulations.

9 Entities that perform functions to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in digital asset securities may be required to register as a clearing agency under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1.

10 See, *e.g.*, Statement on Digital Asset Securities Issuance and Trading, Division of Corporation Finance, Division of Investment Management, and Division of Trading and Markets, Commission (Nov. 16, 2018) (available at: [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/digital-asset-securites-issuuance-and-trading](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/digital-asset-securites-issuuance-and-trading)); see also *e.g*., Engaging on Non-DVP Custodial Practices and Digital Assets, letter issued by staff, Division of Investment Management, Commission, dated Mar. 12, 2019 (available at: [https://www.sec.gov/investment/engaging-non-dvp-custodial-practices-and-digital-assets](https://www.sec.gov/investment/engaging-non-dvp-custodial-practices-and-digital-assets)).

11 See Financial Responsibility Rules for Broker-Dealers, Exchange Act Release No. 70072 (July 30, 2013), 78 Fed. Reg. 51824, 51826 (Aug. 21, 2013). In addition, if the broker-dealer is liquidated in a formal proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (“SIPA”), the securities and cash held by the broker-dealer for its customers would be isolated and readily identifiable as “customer property” and, consequently, available to be distributed to customers ahead of other creditors. Id.

12 See 15 U.S.C. 78fff-1 (setting forth the powers and duties of a SIPA trustee).

13 See paragraphs (b) and (c) of Rule 15c3-3. An entity’s designation as a good control location is based, in part, on its ability to maintain exclusive control over customer securities. See, *e.g*., paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 15c3-3 (deeming a “bank” as defined in Section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act to be a good control location so long as, among other things, the bank has acknowledged that customer securities “are not subject to any right, charge, security interest, lien or claim of any kind in favor of a bank or any person claiming through the bank” and the securities are in the custody or control of the bank).

14 See paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(5) of Rule 15c3-3.

15 The Commission often receives applications under paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 15c3-3 to designate an issuer or the transfer agent of various types of uncertificated securities as a control location. The Division has delegated authority to “find and designate as control locations for purposes of Rule 15c3-3(c)(7) \[under the Exchange Act\] certain broker-dealer accounts which are adequate for the protection of customer securities.” See 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(10)(i). The Commission has stated that mutual funds in particular may be held at the issuer or the issuer’s transfer agent. See, *e.g*., Broker-Dealer Reports, Exchange Act Release No. 70073 (July 30, 2013), 78 Fed. Reg. 51910, 51951 (Aug. 21, 2013) (stating that “\[g\]enerally, mutual funds issue securities only in book-entry form. This means that the ownership of securities is not reflected on a certificate that can be transferred but rather through a journal entry on the books of the issuer maintained by the issuer’s transfer agent. A broker-dealer that holds mutual funds for customers generally holds them in the broker-dealer’s name on the books of the mutual fund”). See also Form Custody for Broker-Dealers, 17 CFR 249.639 (providing broker-dealers with a field to indicate that they custody mutual fund securities with a transfer agent). The Division has also previously issued no-action letters regarding the maintenance of certain other uncertificated securities at the transfer agent. See, *e.g*., letter to Fantex Brokerage Services, LLC from Mark M. Attar, Senior Special Counsel, Division of Trading and Markets, Commission, dated Dec. 19, 2014 (providing that the staff would not recommend enforcement action if a broker-dealer treats a transfer agent for uncertificated securities as a good control location, under certain circumstances). These prior no-action letters do not address whether blockchain or distributed ledger technology, in connection with the maintenance of the single master security holder list, establishes control of uncertificated securities by the issuer (or transfer agent).

16 See, *e.g.,* paragraph (d) of Rule 15c3-3 (requiring that, not later than the next business day, a broker-dealer, as of the close of the preceding business day, shall determine the quantity of fully paid securities and excess margin securities in its possession or control and the quantity of such securities not in its possession or control).

investing,My thoughts on the June FOMC minutes and todays testimony,"I have read through the June FOMC minutes and would like to post my thoughts and concerns. My thoughts will also refer to todays testimony given by Powell. 

My first impressions after reading and listening to the testimony was that there was some bias which leaned towards phrasing things in a manner which was supportive of rate cuts. More specifically, information supporting rate cuts was emphasized while non supportive information was downplayed. It is almost as if Powell has been blindfolded and living under a rock since last speaking in June. According to June's FOMC minutes, economic developments like unemployment data and trade crosscurrents would be monitored closely. However, developments like the ""trade truce"" at the G20, and blowout jobs report are being downplayed, which is contrary to the Fed's prerogatives. 

Powell's response when questioned about trade is “Let’s go to trade: We have agreed to begin discussions again with China and while that’s a constructive step that doesn’t remove the uncertainty that we see as overall weighing on the outlook."" While this is true, there is no denying that the markets have interpreted this ""truce"" as extremely positive. Additionally, the risk of trade escalation occurring at the G20 has been mitigated. Simply put, the trade war between the U.S. and China has not been weighing down markets what so ever. Shouldnt this act as a clue to the fed that further monitoring of the situation is required before making any changes?

Powell's response  when asked if Junes blowout jobs report changes his outlook on his response was ""The straight answer to your question is no."" This response is extremely disturbing as the importance of this report was emphasized greatly in the June FOMC minutes, ""That said, job gains in May were weaker than expected and, in light of other developments, participants judged that it would be important to closely monitor incoming data for any
signs of softening in labor market conditions."" To disregard such a strong report as irrelevant information is very odd.

Last thing I want to point out is that the fed acknowledges that investors are expecting a more dovish policy,""While overall financial conditions remained supportive of growth, those conditions appeared to be premised importantly on expectations that the Federal Reserve would ease policy in the near term to help offset the drag on economic growth stemming from uncertainties about the global outlook and other downside risks"". My concern is that the fed is now being held hostage by the markets and will be forced to lower rates even if it isnt necessary. Furthermore, wouldnt it be dangerous to cut rates when markets are at all time highs?

personalfinance,Mortgage payoff date,"Hi All,

I've got a bit of a complicated history with my mortgage and am trying to figure out when it will actually be paid off with my current situation.  Is there a calculator I can use or can someone give me some advice on how I can figure this out?  Here are some rough background numbers and history.  I can update with real numbers if it would be relevant/appropriate.  

1) Initial Mortgage about 155K with 3.5 % down around 2010

2) A couple years later (maybe 5-6 years ago now) I refinanced to buy out a SO and rolled the whole closing costs back into it pretty much making me start over but I have a 3.25% interest rate now.  I want to say it was like a FHA streamline refi or something. 

3) In the beginning of 2018 I started paying an extra $285 a month as additional principal because i figured that was better than refinancing to a 15 year (to keep my low interest rate and avoid transaction costs but I am not sure if I am right on this).

4) Earlier this year I put a chunk down to get to the 78% or 80% or whatever LTV to get rid of the PMI

5) Today I realized my loan company offers every two week payment options so signed up for that and kicked the extra principal up to $150 a payment to try and save a little interest.  I think they also will make 26 half payments rather than 12 whole payments a year.  

&amp;#x200B;

Given all of that I have no clue how to figure out when I will actually pay this thing off if I stick with the every two week payments with an extra $150 principal per payment.  I'd also like to be able to figure out what will happen if i kick up the extra principal to X per payment so I can play around with the target payoff date.  Thanks in advance, please let me know if any other info would be helpful!

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus Question:  Should I really just stop paying my extra principal and put the extra money in my Roth 401K at work?  I'm sure the return would be better than 3.25% but the idea of not having a mortgage in the next 10-15 years (goal) is so attractive given that i'm in my early 30's",finance

personalfinance,File a chargeback over this? Or am I overreacting?,"I'm hoping someone can help me see this from an outside perspective. Because I'm not sure if I'm justified or overreacting. I placed an online order and paid for it with my credit card. I ordered a large custom-made doll from a 'dealer' of the company that makes them. The doll was intended as a gift for a good friend. Now this cost several hundred dollars, so it wasn't something I would call cheap. 

Because I wanted to give it as a gift for her birthday, I emailed them before I placed the order and asked how long it would take to ship so I could make sure I got it on-time. They told me about 3-4 weeks lead time to ship. Her birthday was about 5 weeks away. As it got to be about 1 month after I placed the order and my friend's birthday was coming up, I emailed them and asked when I could expect it. They replied the factory was backed up and it wouldn't be for another week. Now perhaps I'm wrong, but this annoyed me to begin with because I feel they should have notified me of the delay per the Federal Trade Commission that says a seller has to notify you if they can't ship as promised and give you the option to cancel, I shouldn't have had to check-up on them.

Well I figured okay, as long as it ships the next week I'll still get it in-time for her birthday. As that week came and went I emailed again and was told the factory changed the ship date yet again, this time they expected another week and a half delay. I was pretty annoyed because I didn't have it to give my friend for her birthday, but I still wanted to give it to her, so I figured I would just have to give it to her after her birthday. 

Finally at the very end of the 6th week it showed up...but there was a mistake. When I ordered it, you could select which accessory item you want the doll to hold in her hand...and they had sent me the wrong one. I was pretty pissed and immediately told them of the error, which they told me the factory had made a mistake and they would get the right one mailed out to me. Now personally, I feel since this was not my error, they should put me to the front of the line and ship it out right away with a quick shipping method. 

I asked them when I could expect it and they told me 2 weeks...which I was pretty annoyed about because I felt like I was being sent to the back of the line for something that wasn't my fault. So here I am, at the 2 week mark and still haven't gotten it. It's been about 8 weeks since I ordered the item that was supposed to ship to me in just 3-4 weeks...and it's 3 weeks after my friend's birthday. Each time I've complained they simply tell me that they are just a 'dealer' and that they can't make the factory ship it to me faster. While that may be true, they are the ones I did a business deal with and they are the one that charged my credit card. Of course I'm going to get in contact once again and ask what is going on...but would I be justified in filing a complaint/chargeback with my credit card?

I feel this is ridiculous that they took twice as long as they promised it would take to ship. Didn't tell me there was any delay until I had to get in touch with them to find out what was going on. When I finally get it late, there was an error that was no fault of my own. And instead of immediately fixing the error I get sent to the back of the line and I'm still waiting 8 weeks later for what I was supposed to have in '3-4 weeks'. Am I justified or am I overreacting?",finance

Bitcoin,Fiat is more inflationary than you think.,"Listening to the Fed chair speak today has helped me organize this thought I have had for awhile.

We know that USD and all fiat currencies are inflationary, but many people do not understand to what degree when you account for deflation. 

We live in a deflationary world. Deflation defined here as: Over time it takes less capital and man hours to produce the same amount of goods. We become more efficient as production techniques and technology advances.

A great example is computers. A highly deflationary product, every two years or so the amount of computing power  you get for the same price doubles. In this example the product gets far better, now let’s look at something that stays the same. A loaf of bread.

You take a single loaf of sliced white bread, in 1930 it would have cost about $0.09, and today that same loaf would cost you about $2.05. Now we look at this and ask “did the bread become 20x more valuable? Or did the money become 20x less valuable?” 

Unfortunately this is not the whole story. Now to get to my point, let’s use this easy example.

Let’s say a loaf of bread cost $1.00, then a year Later it cost $1.02. You might think there was 2% inflation. My though here is that it’s far more than that because of the deflationary progress made by society. 

Let’s say the money supply was fixed and we go back to the first year.

 The bread cost $1.00. The next year the bread SHOULD cost $0.98 due to an increase in efficiency. 

Nominal inflation is only half the story. We are being robbed far more the most realize. Prices go up 2% PLUS another 2% for a total of 4% loss in buying power to account for the natural deflationary tendencies of society. 

We are getting robbed on two fronts!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Found out co-worker makes double,"Hi everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently found out that my co-worker's base salary is double mine. I found a contract of theirs in a shared file storage folder. That was fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

We work for a small company. I have been at the company longer than them, and we have almost the same responsibilities. We both work in production, with a lot of overlap to our jobs. They have the added responsibility of bringing in new business, but they have performance bonus built it for that. Outside that arena, our jobs are basically the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, they have worked at large companies before, and are probably much better at negotiation than I am.  They also have a severance package in their contract, something that was never offered to me. The environment of my office is very much friends/co-workers, so I think I mistakenly assumed my boss had my best interests at heart, in regards to pay. To find out someone's base salary is  double mine, is pretty infuriating. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think this person should be paid slightly more than me, to account for their additional biz-dev responsibilities, but double seems ridiculous. I don't think they are over-paid, I think I am under-paid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to remedy this, or find a new job. SO. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. How should I approach my company? Should I wait until contract negotiations begin in December? That's a long time to feel like I'm being effed in the A. 
2. Should I divulge this knowledge?

personalfinance,Question about 10K early distribution for down payment,"Edit: This has been answered. Thank you everyone!

Just a quick question. I am usually very financially savvy, but this one is something I overlooked and I just need confirmation (and nothing on Google is confirming this for me). I am closing on a house next week, and my wife is going to use 10K towards our down payment.

Here's the kicker, this whole time I'm thinking ""net 10K"" so I've been basing all my final figures grossing up from there. This year, at this point, we'll be paying 22% federal tax rate and 7% state. So it brings me to about $14,085 after grossing up. This nets me 10K.

But that's not how this works is it...

It's actually going to be $10k gross.... essentially leaving me with $7100 for the house. Which is crazy because ""10K for a down payment"" is kind of misleading when a good chunk isn't really going to the house.

personalfinance,Investment vs paying off mortgage,"Hi guys, 

I know this has discussed many times and I went through some of those threads, but each situation is also different and I would like to get some guidance. 

I was born and grew up in Europe and I relocated to South Africa in 2015, where my wife is from. 

We purchased a house last year and we got a mortgage. I have money in Europe that is sitting in savings accounts, but currently, most accounts generate between 0.5% and 1% … so basically nothing.  

I’ve converted the amounts to $ just to make it easier. 

Key figures : 

Period : 20 years

Property purchase price : 280 000$

Initial Down payment : 70 000$

Interest rate : 7,5% (and that’s only because the wife works for a bank). 

Our plan was initially to sell our previous property, but after a year, we hadn’t received an offer that matched what we paid for it, so now we are renting it out. The problem is because there’s no mortgage on this property, we will be taxed heavily on the generated income. 

I’ve got around 70 000$ that are currently not generating any interest. 

I am not keen on investing it in the stock market because I don’t have the time or the knowledge to manage it properly. I have tried to check for funds I could invest in, but I have not found anything I was comfortable with. 

What would you this in this situation ? Would you move the money abroad and use it to pay off your mortgage early ? 

Is there any investment recommendations you can make ?

personalfinance,IRS Withholding Calculator says we are massively overwithholding; need more guidance,"Fair disclosure - I posted this in the weekly question thread, but the few comments I got were encouraging me to reduce my exemptions &amp; change my withholding to Married at Single Rate, which would make my current problem worse.

Here are our details:

* Married, filing jointly, both full time employees
* Household income for the year will be about 126,000
* YTD we've contributed maybe $4500 in federal taxes
* Both people just got raises so this doesn't reflect the rest of the year, but currently each of us earns 5600 per month with a little over 450 of that going to federal tax
* No state taxes
* We have 2 dependent children and are going to have 2 more by the end of CY2019; we'll qualify for the child/dependent care credit as well as the standard child tax credit
* We are both claiming 1 exemption each right now on the W-4

At the end of CY2018 I had used the IRS withholding calculator, which basically said ""You are done paying taxes this year, claim 10 exemptions each and you'll get a large refund"". So for a few months, that's what we did, and we ended up with a $4200ish refund. Now, the IRS and TurboTax calculators are again saying we need to be claiming 11-13 exemptions each in order to not massively overwithhold. Does that seem right? Is there a good online resource that can help me fine-tune my withholding? We've received a large refund 3 years in a row now, and I'm tired of getting a refund in April when I can have the money throughout the rest of the year. 

TL;DR: I need help figuring out our federal withholding. IRS Withholding Calculator says husband and I need to claim 11+ exemptions each, we are only claiming 1 each, I need to figure out where the right spot is.",finance

$4500 in a Discover high yield savings account- APY 2.1%

$900 in Fidelity Brokerage account

28k in student loan debt (repayment starts in January) at various interest rates (3-5%)

$250 on my Chase cc

I pay $875 per month on rent for a nice 900 sq foot townhouse, $100 on groceries, $100 electric, $50 natural gas, $60 internet. 

My employer does not match a 401k until after the first year (I just started a month ago). I am also on my parents health insurance plan for the foreseeable future. 

In January, my lease will be up on my 2017 Chevrolet Cruze. My parents have been and will continue to pay for it until the lease is up. My goal is to save money for a new used car in January. With the money I have in my high yield Discover account, as well as putting $1200 each month towards this, I figure to have somewhere north of 10k saved for a car. 

My concern is that I will be essentially putting any further saving on hold, and will not be making any progress towards my goals while saving up for a car. However, I’d really rather not have a car payment each month. 

Am I going about this the right way? Should I be saving less for the car and stashing some money somewhere else? What else should I be doing now, while I’m young? I am very interested and motivated by saving money (I am trying to treat it like a game).

investing,Inflation Unexpectedly Rises in June to 2.1%,"US core inflation unexpectedly accelerates to 2.1% in June
as Fed decision nears
Thursday, July 11, 2019 7:40 AM CT
By Sakshi Maurya Market Intelligence
Annual core inflation in the U.S. unexpectedly accelerated to 2.1% in June from 2.0% in May, data from the U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics showed.
The Econoday consensus estimate was for annual core inflation, which excludes food and energy, to remain at 2.0%.
Month over month core inflation was 0.3%, the largest monthly increase since January 2018. The Econoday consensus
estimate was 0.2%.
The broader U.S. consumer price index rose 1.6% year over year in June, slowing from 1.8% in May, and in line with
expectations.
Month over month, CPI increased 0.1% in June, beating the consensus estimate of 0.0%. A rise in prices of shelter,
apparel, used cars and trucks more than offset a decline in energy prices, which were down 2.3%.
Energy prices fell 3.4% on a yearly basis, while food prices climbed 1.9%.
The U.S. Federal Reserve targets 2% annual inflation.
Its favorite measure of inflation, the core PCE price index, was at 1.6% in May.
Many Federal Reserve officials said at their June meeting that the case for lowering interest rates this year ""had
strengthened,"" but the central bank was divided on whether rate cuts would end up being necessary, minutes of the
meeting released On July 10 show.
The minutes highlight a split among Fed officials as they consider cutting interest rates this year, potentially as soon as
the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting at the end of July. The Fed's June meeting resulted in officials
keeping the federal funds rate at a target range of 2.25% to 2.5% but signaling openness toward loosening monetary
policy.
Only a couple of Fed officials backed lowering the federal funds rate at the June meeting, the minutes show. That likely
was St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who have called for lower
rates to guard against downside risks and help get inflation back to the Fed's 2% goal. A handful of other Fed officials
have
"" data-original-title=""""&gt;said it may be too early for a rate cut.

personalfinance,My dog attacked another dog. Paying for their vet bills.,"Hello,

I adopted a dog six months ago and while he was a great dog, he showed aggression to other dogs. He managed to get through our screen door and attack a small dog that was on a walk. The owners have been understanding with us. We ended up surrendering our dog to animal control because we didn't want it to attack another dog or become aggressive to children or our cat. Anyways, their vet bills are around $2400 and rising with dressing changes, etc. We asked our home owners insurance but they go by the value of the dog and since this dog was adopted, as well, it's not that much, plus it would raise our rates dramatically. Both my wife and I are in school full time so we don't have much savings right now. My question is what is the best way of paying for this? Personal loan? Home equity? We bought our house last year and have about $15,000 in equity. I am a nurse who can pick up shifts casually when I'm not studying so if I pick up ten shifts I can cover the cost. I'm leaning more to a personal loan because even though the interest rate is higher, I can pay it back within a few months if I work those extra shifts. Just wondering what your thoughts are.",finance

TLDR at the bottom. 

So in a nutshell, I am freelance contractor so all of work is 1099. I currently have a payment plan setup paying about $150/mo for my 2017 taxes, and I filed an extension for my 2018 taxes which I owe about $7k combined fed and state. 

I also currently have about $14k in CC debt. I have never really carried much CC debt, I’ve always been great about paying them down each month. Due to some unforeseen circumstances and car troubles etc. I unfortunately ended up racking up about $14k on one card. 

My question is this: I have a contract that is paying me about $15k over the next 2 months. I am wondering if I should split this to pay down my 2018 taxes and out the rest towards my CC balance...OR, if it would make more sense to completely pay down my CC debt first and then potentially combine payment plans for 2017 and 2018 taxes come October? I’m pretty sure you can’t have multiple payment plans active with the IRS but I’m not sure if I can combine the 2 and re-negotiate etc. 

Thanks in advance! 

TLDR: I have $15k in additional income coming in the next 2 months. Do I pay down my $7k tax bill first or my $14k in CC debt first.",finance

personalfinance,"Pay off low-interest student loans, buy car to increase job opps or contribute to retirement?","Hi, this is my first post here and I'm new to this forum. 
I'm 35 and really trying to take hold of my finances after poor choices in my younger days, recovering from a low-income upbringing and moving a lot in my adult life.

I've hit my emergency savings goal to get me through 3 months and am trying to figure out what I should be focusing on next. 

I'm aggressively saving up to buy a car. I don't have one and I live in a city where it's not an absolute necessity, however I recently finished a new degree and am in the job hunting phase in my new field. I'm really limited in where I can apply because a lot of the jobs are outside the accessibility of public transportation. I also live in a hilly area with cold winters, so biking to work is out of the question. My goal is to get a car around $12-14k and save up $6k (I'm already at 5k) to be used as a down payment while financing the other half. I have really good credit and plan on keeping payments at $200 a month or lower which should be totally doable with my credit score and down payment. 

 I live a modest life with a modest income ($30k-$45k) from multiple but inconsistent sources and my only debt is $5500 in 2 student loans. Interest rate is 4.4% but because one of the loans is really old, I'm barely paying anything on interest these days (like a dollar or two a month). It all goes to principal.

My question is, am I correct in saving up for a car right now? I'm hoping to get one by the end of the summer.  Or should I just pay off one or both of the student loans just to decrease debt even though interest rate is not really an issue? Or, should I not be focusing on student loans and instead be contributing the bulk of that money to my retirement? I have an old 401k sitting at an old company. I haven't contributed anything in 6 years. I know I need to roll it over and contribute again but was planning on doing that once I get a car. I appreciate any advice. Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Trouble figuring out how to go about purchasing my first car.,"Some background in case it matters: just started my first job this week, at a base salary of 95k. I get a sign -on bonus of 10k with my first paycheck next Friday with the common stipulation of it not really being ""mine"" for a year. I have ~50k in federal loans, and my rent/utilities is ~1200 a month. 

So I have only ever driven my parents' cars, and not a tremendous amount at that. But in this city one simply needs a car to get to work, at least during the summer where biking seems unreasonable in 100 degree weather. I know very little about cars and am the opposite of manual labor-inclined. At this point I can only rely on ride share for my commute, but I figure that it could cost me ~10k for a year, at what I guess is a somewhat generous estimate. Car shopping is obviously a headache, and I am reading as much as I can digest on the matter. The smart thing seems like getting a used car, but I am not sure how ""used"" I should go for. Note that I know no one here except my coworkers whom I could try to ask for help, though I am not sure of the best way to go about that.

Furthermore, the countries that I like to live in, are not good for buying apartment with my condition (e.g. Switzerland, Singapore, etc which are crazy expensive and low ROI). 

Unfortunately, atm, I don't have time to learn about investing in stocks (I'm planning to learn but can start learning in a year, at earliest). But I would like to start investing for my retirement. I don't like it that my money is unused and is losing value over the time. So I'm wondering what are the least risky options which don't require much expertise (at least at the beginning)? I'm looking for long term investment, and it would be great  if it pays extra pension regularly rather than lump sum (however this is not a must). However, when I check private pension funds in Switzerland, their interest rate is 0.4 - 0.7% annually which is too low.

So, which advice do you have for me? Despite being too busy, I really like to start investing but in secure and good opportunities.

Currently I'm based in Finland but most probably I'll move to another country (haven't decided yet, but maybe Switzerland)

Credit Card 1700 @ 17.5 (paying this off now)

Credit card 2500 (1300@0% until November) the remaining @ 28%

investing,Why the Fed matters.,"I think a lot of people are confused by the Federal Reserve and what they do, so here it goes:

1/ The Fed ONLY controls the ""Federal Funds Rate"". This is the rate that banks borrow/lend in the Federal Funds market. When this rate rises it encourages banks to park their excess reserves with the Fed and receive 2.5% risk free. 

2/ When the Fed RAISES rates, their goal is to discourage lending by banks, slow inflation and remove excess liquidity. (Banks sit on their parked cash and become more selective with extending credit). 

3/ When the Fed CUTS rates, their goal is to encourage lending, inflation and increase liquidity.

**Here's why this matters,** When the Fed raises rates, their intention is to minimize inflation and protect the value of the dollar. If you keep rates at 0% for 7 straight years, like what the Fed did, you are recklessly encouraging money printing and trashing the dollar.

With Trump and the bartender calling for lower rates, they are looking to WEAKEN the DOLLAR. this means, MONEY PRINTING and DOLLAR devaluation again. This benefits asset prices but puts us on course for more and more dangerous bubbles. **In layman's terms, cash is trash.**

The problem is this, at 2.5% FF rate the economy can't get going because it will choke on too much debt. 

**TL;DR The Fed is trapped. They can't raise rates anymore because it will cause the massive debt load to topple on itself. If they cut rates, they are encouraging inflation, which will devalue the dollar 💵 and lead to higher long term rates and dangerous bubbles.**",finance

My student loan balance is about $80,000 combined with federal and private student loans. Average interest rate on the loans is about 6% (note I am planning on trying to refinance). I am 22 years old and I currently make $4,000 a month after taxes and with a 4% contribution to my 401k. Not including any student loan payments, my average expenses are about $1,300/mo (includes rent/utilities/food/gas/entertainment). Any surplus I have after my expenses either goes to a HYSA or ETF investment fund.

&amp;#x200B;

Just using a simple compound interest calculator, picking a term length of 5yrs will equate to about a $1,600/mo student loan payment. That would result in about $2,900 of total monthly expenses and leaving $1,100 each month for savings and investments.  Is this payment term too aggressive? Should I be saving more money? In the next few years, I could foresee my rent increasing by $500/mo. Also, my parents still pay for my car insurance so that could be another expense I have to consider soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be better to take out a longer term of like 10yrs and then make additional payments when I can? That would allow me to even contribute more into my 401k (my employer matches up to 8% and I'm doing 4%). Or should I just try to pay off my debt as fast as possible and as aggressively as I can? My concern is that a longer term result in higher overall payment but the higher payment of the shorter term opens more risk in case my expenses suddenly increase.

I think it might be worth it to take a distribution from the retirement accounts and pay off the mortgage on the second home. Yes, I understand there will be a 10% early disbursement penalty and income taxes on the distribution. Yes, I understand a 4.5% interest rate on that mortgage is low so it's pretty cheap debt.  


But the mortgage payments are mostly interest in the beginning and the cash flow of the extra mortgage payment is painful. I'm wondering if the taxes and penalties are worth it to not carry the mortgage and get the property free and clear. In the long run, it feels like the real estate appreciation will have decent returns compared to the retirement account's conservative appreciation and we'll be able to sell the property to fund retirement when the time comes. The amount paid in taxes and penalties might be less than the amount paid in interest over the duration of the loan.

personalfinance,Overwhelmed with total number of student loans,"23, recent college grad, I have 7 different private loans through Sallie Mae and 3 federal loans. All of the loans are in their grace period until November. 

Currently working a job that pays net just under 3k/month and so far I have 1k in a high yield savings account, just over 5k in my Roth IRA. The student loans add up to just around 62k, probably ending up higher because of the interest.

I’m a bit overwhelmed in terms of budgeting because I’m trying to find a place to live with a roommate, and I don’t want to pick a place that will spread me too thin (rent, utilities, car insurance). 

I’m likely going to consolidate the private loans into one to get a lower interest rate (some of my loans are upwards of 8% interest rate, and I can probably get one loan around 4(ish)%)

I might just be psyching myself out, but does anyone have any advice on how to weather the storm in my mind given my near-future circumstances? Ideally I want to find a place to live that puts my rent/utilities/car insurance payments at no higher than 1200/month, as my current savings plan has me putting $300 into my savings account and Roth IRA each. Does this seem reasonable?

I can adjust things accordingly as needed, but I’m just looking for a good starting point. Sorry if this post is all over the place, I don’t post here often but would like to start becoming more involved in the community :)",finance
personalfinance,Pay of loan or invest,"Sorry for asking the same old question but after scratching my head for a bit on this and reading multiple post, it'd be nice to get a sanity check on this.

I'm trying to weigh my options between early payments on my mortgage vs investing the money instead. My understanding is that from a purely financial point of view, if I can get a ROI greater than my mortgage interest rate, I come out ahead. But I want to estimate by how much so that I can weigh it against my peace of mind from being debt free.

Loan| Balance | Interest Rate | Monthly Payments | Early Repayment Possible
---|---|----|----|------
Mortgage| $545k | 1.58% | $3k | $27,250/year

I built up some amortization tables and started mucking around so this is where my uncertainty is. 

Case | Extra Payment | Total Paid
--|--|---
Base | $0 | $624k
Early Repayment | $27,250 once every year | $590k

The difference is only $34k which at first seemed negligible considering how much the early repayment is but considering the interest rate is as low as it is - could be right?

If I compare this to investing the @27,250/year instead, at say 5% ROI/year for 10 years, the gains are $87k minus tax.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Cash out Refi help,"I have 2 near term goals: 
- Fix my homes current Roof
- buy another home, rent current home

We bought our current house thinking with the intention of flipping. The rate was 3.75% 5/1 ARM. House has been flipped (kitchen bathrooms, front and back yards, but needs a new roof), but we decided to keep the property. 5 years is up, so the rate up'd to 5.0%. I'm currently in the middle of a refi, with a fixed 30 year at 3.25%. I don't plan on getting rid of the current house.

With that being said we have about $200k in equity. I was already planning on pulling out 66k to consolidate some student loans. However I can go up $105k total. 

Since that rate is really low compared to other loans I may want in the future.  Should I take out the extra cash now and use it as I go? I was thinking of keeping the extra money in an HYSA until I use it, making the interest in the extra cash effectively 1.0% (if interest rates stay the same). Right now I'm thinking of pulling out a total $100k in cash, from the house, but either way I am pulling out $69k to consolidate student loans. 

I have a stable job, wife's job is decently stable. Both of us are 31. I don't foresee the extra money in the mortgage payment being that big of a downside. 

Anybody see cons? I know that I am now securing debt to my house, I know that my mortgage is going up, but it seems like a decent deal...

I see that if I use some money to upgrade this house, I can potentially deduct that cost from our taxes. Does a new roof and solar panels count for that type of deduction? I'm estimating a cost of $20k for that work. Which would leave me $10k toward a down payment.

Or does using all the extra ($30k) money for a down payment on another home give me any kind of deduction or  capability I'm not thinking about?

Homes around here are in the $500-700ks.  Current 3bd/2b is valued at $625k. Next house we will buy,  ( if soon) will undoubtedly be around 670k. 

Most importantly thank you in advance for any help/ advice you can offer. If you think there are other more appropriate ways to use the money I'm all ears.

 

TLDR: home has equity, family is young; looking to pull cash out of the home to either fix up current house with new roof and solar panels or use the cash for a new home purchase in order to rent out the current. Need to understand pros and cons of my choices (how much to pull out and how to use the money) Or other options and choices could be thrown out.",finance

personalfinance,CC Balance Transfer Issues,"Hi everyone! About a year ago I was underemployed and racked up about $12K in CC debt. Now I'm in a much better job and ready to start cutting into that. My assumption is that my best bet is to transfer the balance to a card that has a 0% Introductory APR for a specified period of time (typically 12-18 months). So I've applied for a few cards and was finally accepted to one. 0% APR until Dec 2020 with a $5,000 credit limit. The problem is that I want to transfer all $12,000. What should I do? Option 1: Try again with a new company to hopefully get a credit limit of $7,000 that can take care of my whole debt. I assume that this will really hurt my credit score, but the plan is to take the next year to got those under control and then close the accounts once they're done. Option 2: Cut my losses here. Be happy that I get 0% interest for a while on the $5,000 and aggressively cut into the other $7,000 as it collects interest. The main reason I don't want to do this is because I don't have a lot of savings and would feel like I should throw every spare penny in my budget to this debt because of the ridiculous interest rate. I'd rather take some time to build my savings, cut into the interest free debt, and then when the interest kicks in decide how much to throw at the debt. I would appreciate any advice you can give!",finance

personalfinance,Wondering which to pay off first,"Long story short, have been getting my finances seriously straightened out this past year or two. This has included getting a job with a higher salary, refinancing aprivate and gov’t student loan, and paying off about $6,000 in credit card debt from being young/stupid/broke. 

I now make well over what I need to live (about $3400 a month) and bills are around $1400 (including rent). Car has been paid off and I happily drive my 2006 Honda with 320k miles all over with no issues. In short, it’s been great to get out of debt, slow as it’s been, and my credit score has risen inverse to my stress levels. No late payments in 5+ years, no adverse actions. 

Now, here’s the big ugly thing- I still owe $9,200 on a credit card with a 24% interest rate. No need to make excuses, but it got out of control and paying the minimum ($272/month) was all I could do for a long time. I finally told my mom about this and she offered to take some money out of her retirement (she can do a loan of $4,000 over 5 years with no penalties for early repayment and very low interest, which I will pay back to her) to help me. I’ll pay this back to her and pay far less interest to the card with the added bonus of having a smaller credit utilization score. She’s happy to help, and since I’m paying it back I’m happy to accept it. 

So the question is now centered on this- the minimum payment to her is around $40 a month. My credit card payment minimum will go down, not sure to what yet, but I’ll owe about $5,500 on it with that 24% interest rate. 

These are the options I’m weighing:

A. Pay the minimum right now to her, and put as much as I can a month ($1200 or so while still allowing for savings) to get the credit card paid off, then pay her off in larger chunks. This will save me interest over time on the credit card, and there are far less penalties for paying the minimum to her. 

B. Pay the minimum on the card and pay her off in a few months, because as soon as the loan is repaid she can take another out for $4k and I can pay off the remaining balance at the lower rate and with a lower monthly payment in case of emergency.

C. Pay her the minimum, and take out a 0% APR card to transfer the balance on the existing card once my score goes up from paying off the $4000. It should be around 720 or so if those calculators are accurate at all. This might have a 3% transfer fee of $165, but it’s far less than 24% APR. I then pay either her off quickly and then the card or vice-versa, since the relative cost for either is very low.

What do you all think? Any options I’m missing? I’m lucky to be able to really hammer these out in the next 6 months or so, but I want to do it in the way that makes the most sense.",finance

personalfinance,Should I just pay off the final two student loans or focus on saving? Figuring out if I should change my financial strategy,"Hey Guys!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm finally near the end of my student loans and would like some advice on how to proceed. A few quick stats/ info to make things easier:

Age: 28

Student Loans (all federal/ Subsidized);

4300@4.25%

4500@3.15% APR

&amp;#x200B;

I have a little bit of savings right now in investments and an efund:

4k@ wealthfront

1k@Ally

11.8K@stocks in the market taxable

1.6k in a ROTH IRA , 1.1k deposited for this year

17.7K@ Vanguard 401k --6%salary of a70k salary put in to hit max match by employer.

500 dollars sitting in a local bank account to keep it open.

Located right outside of NYC in Northern NJ 

&amp;#x200B;

So a few things i'm thinking of doing and maybe i missed this in the flow chat/ has a little bit of ambiguity since the interest rates are moderately low...

\- Should I sell/ liquidate my stock portfolio and pay off my student loans?

*If i do this, the biggest thing is there will be  a tax bill next april. I've gained \~\~14% \~\~1.2k of the portfolio in gains. So the tax bill gain is two fold, i'll pay capital gains taxes as well as lose my interest rate reduction on taxes. Maybe this is a moot point but I wanna talk it out and understand it a bit better.  The other big negative to doing this is it'll drastically kill my cash reserves right now which gives me a small bit of anxiety if I lose my job. Although what I can do by liquidating my taxable account is that I can move the rest of the money into my roth and let it grow tax free and then  build up the taxable account slowly after the ROTH to reap tax benefits.* 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Keep things as is and focus on the student loans?

*Stop saving, just focus on paying them down. Sounds slow and boring and tough to put everything I save into loans especially when I have the money but does create a safety blanket.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*-*Do a mixture of both and save money and pay student loans:

*Feels like the safe route to go but may just be dilly dallying on the loans*.

Then maybe try to bump the other 2 loans by $1000 each monthly in terms of payment so they get paid down sooner. And then invest whatever is left after taxes and life expenses.

Currently faced with this decision: pay off my car or pay down a credit card? 

Total credit card debt: $$25,422. Across 3 cards, all have an interest rate of 17.4%.

Because they all have the same interest rate, I’ve been taking the snowball approach (and it’s more motivating for me psychologically).

So, lowest credit card is at $6,053. 
I have $2,000 left on my car payment (interest is close to negligible) at $250/month payments (I pay $350/month after my insurance lowered by $100).

I have an inclination to make my funds stretch, take $2,000 this month and pay my car off to roll those payments into my CC’s.

That was really the thing that fucked everything up.

Also, I'm paying for my tuition with cash out of pocket (already have degree, so no financial aid), though I was unemployed when I started and put my first semester on a credit card, and I'm in my last semester. After I make my last tuition payment in December, I will have 6 months before Fedloan starts extorting me again, so I got that going which is nice, but that will probably be me trying to stay above water with winter utility bills. After I graduate, I'd be (eventually) moving laterally and starting over again in a slightly higher-paying field so I estimate I'd be making about the same.

I'm already eating on $30 a week, not cooling my house, only doing free activities, using the lowest plan of pre-paid phone with a 6 year old phone, not doing any unnecessary traveling, don't eat out, don't have a TV plan or Netflix/Prime/Hulu, and my internet plan is already the lowest one and I've already haggled with them to lower it, my total mortgage payment is the same as a 1BR apartment, we're not doing any home improvement, etc. so I'm not looking for suggestions for how to reduce expenses.

I've asked for more on-site work at my current job, so I can get an expense check for driving, but I haven't been sent much of anywhere lately so it's not been much

Should I just keep doing what I'm doing until I'm no longer paying tuition? Things aren't getting WORSE, but I'm not able to save or pay more toward my debt, so things are definitely PRECARIOUS. If I lost my job or got injured, I'd be fucked.

I haven't asked for a raise at my current job for over a year and a half. Part of me thinks there's no harm in asking, part of me thinks they'll say no cause I graduate in December and use it as a reason to get rid of me. Nothing indicates they're going to get rid of me, but I'm very paranoid and that's where my mind goes cause better the hell I know than the one I don't.

personalfinance,Car dealership pulled 4 hard inquiries to take out one car loan. Is this normal?,"I recently purchased a vehicle that I fully anticipated financing through my local credit union. I was able to secure a 2.99% fixed rate which I was satisfied with as a 22 year old with a sizable student loan balance.

The dealer stated that my credit unions advertised auto interest rate was good, and they and the dealership had done enough business together that they had a speedy process to get the loan approved and issued. I think great, let's do this.

Salesman tells me it's important to shop the rate at other competitive banks, which I guess I consented to by showing some sort of agreement, I don't remember the exact conversation. What I didn't realize is I was hit for 4 hard inquiries, 2 from other ""competitive"" local banks, 1 from the dealer. Why the hell did this happen? I only noticed this happened bc my credit score dropped bc of too many hard inquiries within 2 year.

Best rate I was given was with my credit union which I wanted from the beginning, so bc of that and simplicity of keeping my direct deposit and loan payment under the same roof, it all made sense.

&gt; The U.S. Justice Department is pursuing a criminal investigation into whether Johnson &amp; Johnson lied to the public about the possible cancer risks of its talcum powder, people with knowledge of the matter said.

&gt; The criminal probe, which hasn’t been reported previously, coincides with a regulatory investigation and civil claims by thousands of cancer patients that J&amp;J’s Baby Powder talc was responsible for their illness.

&gt; The grand jury was impaneled after the Justice Department’s fraud unit started an investigation. Investigators are probably looking for more internal communications that might conflict with the company’s public statements, said Henry Klingeman, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in New Jersey.

&gt; In addition to the consumers’ suits, some J&amp;J investors have accused the company of defrauding them, arguing in lawsuits that J&amp;J failed to disclose that its powder was tainted and that the company’s shares were artificially inflated as a result.

&gt; Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC trial lawyer now in private practice in Washington, said there’s no timeline for grand-jury investigations and no certainty it will result in charges. “This could be a high-profile government investigation that goes nowhere,” he said. “Regardless of the outcome, the timetable for such investigations can measure in years, not months,” he added.",finance

personalfinance,I need guidance on what I already know is a bad decision. Pulling from my Roth IRA,"So, about a year ago I went back to school to finish my nursing degree. I'm six weeks from graduating. We knew when we started things would be tight financially, and we would have to make it work by running up our credit cards, but the reward (stable well paying career that nearly doubled our income) was worth it. When we did the math, we could make it work. We didnt forsee that this year would include more stitches, x-rays, and 105 F degree fevers within our family than the previous thirteen years of our marriage combined. Idk how the fuck it happened. But now I graduate in six weeks, and the medical bills we have had this year equal roughly the same amount we need to coast through to me working again. I cant think of another option besides borrowing against the Roth IRA. It's just $3000, but the credit card debt from books and scrubs, doctor's fees, and $6000 in childcare I had to pay in order to go to school has kind of effed our credit as far as doing something else that I can think of. 

I'll be goddamned if I drop out this close to the finish line because of financial hardship. I get excellent grades. I perform so well at clinicals I've had several hiring managers tell me to come back once I have my license. 

Quitting is stupid. 

Withdrawing $3k from your roth IRA at 32 years old is stupid. 

My husband makes enough money to pay ALL the bills and have enough left over for food, gas, and some incidentals. The extra $3k would cover my graduation expenses (roughly $1k. Including my license exam fee - THIS IS A MUST. I can't work without my license. A certification class that I dont legally need, but it would be difficult to find work without and difficult to schedule the 40 hours necessary to take the class if I waited until I was working to pay for it, and a review/study course that I don't TECHNICALLY need, but if you haven't gone to nursing school you don't get a say in whether or not I should get extra study materials between graduation and NCLEX.)
Also, we have about $800 left in childcare expenses before they go back to school (summer= full time care) plus a couple hundred in sports fees (why tf should they have to skip a whole season when I graduate three weeks after registration is due. I then padded those numbers with a couple hundred bucks to round up to $3k to account for stuff like the fact that I'd need to buy new scrubs to start working to get the first paycheck to afford the scrubs I would have to wear starting on the first day, and school fees for the kids, and holding us over if there's a delay in testing, getting my ATT, dead battery on my car, etc. You never know, and I cant believe we hit a financial wall so close to the end. 

I guess my question is: can I borrow against my roth IRA? There isnt a ton in it, we just started saving about five years ago, but I'd be able to pay it back by Christmas. 

Is there a better ""pull 3k out of thin air"" option I haven't thought of?

Note: remember my husband makes enough to pay all bills and food and regular incidentals. Two months from now we will have my whole income that just needs to cover child care (during school is only $40 a week to watch them for an hour and put them on the bus to school) and the rest of my income can pay down debts and build savings. Shit is going to turn around so fast for us once I get my license, but the issue is getting there. So close, yet so far. 

I have no fear of not being hired quickly. We are in a nursing shortage, I can pass a drug screen, and I've made a ton of great connections at my clinical assignments in school. Plus my school helps graduates find jobs.",finance
personalfinance,Life is expensive. How do I proceed?,"After being a homeowner for 19 months it’s become apparent to me that I’m running out of money. Any emergency fund is completely gone at this point and it doesn’t look like I’ll be able to contribute to my IRA for the first time since I started it. 

My financials:

Income: $42k per year

Liquid funds: $3,000

Roth IRA: $36,902

Credit card balances: $3402.16 (no interest)

Mortgage payment: $1300 a month (paying an additional $165 per month to principal) *Has a $126 monthly PMI attached. 2.75% interest rate FHA Loan. 

Explanation/Questions:
The credit card balances are no interest because they are either promotions or I’m paying my full statement balance every month. However I do currently owe more than I have liquid for the first time ever. 

I guess my question has to be, since it appears I’m spending more than I’m making, should I stop paying extra to principal on my mortgage to avoid paying interest on a credit card? The idea was to refinance down the road and get rid of the PMI (need 20% equity) but it’s not worth paying credit card levels of interest on essentially the same money in this case correct? 

It seems like the IRA problem won’t be solved unless I spend less or make more. It hurts me to not contribute but I may not have an option.

personalfinance,Financially Overwhelmed: Divorce &amp; Lots of Debt... any help is appreciated.,"Thank you in advance for reading this and for any advice bestowed upon me.

&amp;#x200B;

Very complicated divorce, lots of details, but these are the main financial areas I am focusing on right now, with more details below:

\- More than $20,000 of Debt ($15,000 accruing an average of 24% monthly APR)

\- Monthly expenses greater than monthly income

&amp;#x200B;

I've been going through the divorce process for the last year now, litigating for the last 7 months, and have racked up over $20,000 in legal fees and credit card debt. 

I live in NY and although I make a great living at $70,000+/year before taxes (Usually around $1,500/Week, $1,200 after taxes), I've been going in the red every month. 

  
I'm not sure how much detail I should/shouldn't go into, as I want to be thorough, but don't want to turn this into a therapy session/pity party. Main expenses are:

\- Rent of $1,350/Month

\- Child Support $1,300/Month (Hopefully decreasing to $1,100 soon)

\- Car Lease $350/Month

\- Public Transportation $330 (Complicated as my Ex uses the car, but I use the MTA/LIRR for work/to see my child)

\- Interest Charges $300/Month, which are met when I make my minimum payments of $300 toward each line of credit

\- Groceries $250/Month

\- Utilities/Gym Membership/Toiletries/Laundry/Misc. $250/Month

\- Car Insurance $185/Month

\- Life/Disability Insurance $120/Month

&amp;#x200B;

**Total Monthly Expenses**   $4,410.00    (Probably forgetting something)

**Total Monthly Income After Taxes**   $5,160.00    ($1,200/Week x 4.3 Weeks/Month. Also Varies as I Make Tips) 

&amp;#x200B;

My credit score was 700, but now it's 570 with my limit practically maxed and with so much of it utilized. I'd get rid of the lease (with a lease swap, but there's only a year left until it ends, and it's very inconvenient to not have it when I see my son).

For the last year almost, I have been paying much more every month in spousal support ($800/week in total, which is how I built up so much debt). I haven't been able to pay my lawyer in a couple months as I haven't had the funds to. With my rough/varying figures, starting in August I'll be slightly in the black, considering I don't pay my lawyer and have no unexpected financial emergencies... 

I work 5-6 days a week, usually nights, don't have a degree, and am open to working more (but also don't want to burnout/hate my life...). I try to keep my mornings open for exercise/self-care. I have considered dog walking, food delivery, another restaurant job (not ideal), reselling things I find for free on craigslist, looking for passive/residual forms of income (but don't know of any yet, possibly modeling (not that I'm great looking, but am just desperate af...). 

I just want to get out of debt, and start saving (as that was the direction we were headed in before the divorce). Reading, ""4 Hour Work Week,"" by Tim Ferris, looking up videos on Youtube in regards to improving my finance management, and now I'm here.

personalfinance,"68, Retired; refinance to avoid IRA drain and tax?","Much lurking, first post! I am investigating refinancing our home to avoid drawing down our IRAs and the associated tax. 

Our debts are the car and the mortgage. The car has just over 2 years left on a low interest loan. The house is worth over $400K with a 6 year old 30yr fixed for $190K at 3.85%. Otherwise debt free for years with great credit.

I have been spread-sheeting all our spending for years. We are very happy with our present lifestyle and location. Our joy and bucket list is all about home renovation using our own substantial skills and energies. According to my predictive retirement spreadsheet, assuming average returns minus inflation is 3% and no extraordinary medical expenses, we have enough in our Vanguard 2015 to leave us with a paid mortgage and $150K at 90. We do have some wiggle room in our budget if we need to reduce spending. We will do so if predictions go wrong and will still consider ourselves to be very lucky people if some adjustments have to be made.

I am presently receiving low spousal SS to get the max when I am 70, which will be 2 years from now. This will result in a substantial draw on our IRAs at 22% fed+state income tax. After I turn 70 and the car is paid off, our yearly withdrawals will be 1/3 of the present, with a 4% total tax. The result is a draw of 1/3 or our savings over the next two years. 

I am thinking about refinancing with a new 30 year fixed and $100K cash out. This would leave the mortgage above water in case of a housing bust. I would bank this cash and use it over the next two years. This would result immediately in going to the lower withdrawal rates and tax rate. My predictive spreadsheet says we would be somewhat better off.  We would have $40k more at age 96, when the new mortgage is paid off. Of course I am pretty sure that we will not be living in our present home 30 years from now, but I think that predictions using that assumption will still be useful. The only downside I see is that putting that $100K into play implies the usual risk.

investing,My attempt to understand a yield curve inversion,"*They say the best way to understand something is to explain it. Here goes. I'm looking for a better understanding so if I've missed something or I'm not quite getting it then by all means, correct me.*

_______

Generally longer dated bonds have to offer a higher yield, because the longer the maturity the more chance that inflation will rise at some point and erode value of the coupon. 

Eg, say a 10 year bond pays 5% and the inflation rate is currently 2%. In real terms you're making 3% per annum, great. But what happens if in year 3 inflation shoots up to 10 percent? Suddenly your bond is paying you less than the rate to keep up with inflation and you're losing money in real terms. And the value of the bond - if you want to sell it - goes through the floor.

With short term bonds (say a 2 year maturity) the risk of inflation suddenly shooting up between now and then is lower, so the yield doesn't need to be as high to entice you to buy it.

This is in normal circumstances, and might give us 2year and 10year yields of 1% and 5% respectively. A graph of all the possible yields is called the yield curve and generally is upward sloping in a concave shape (bulges out in the shape of a 'r').

Sometimes the yield curve becomes flatter or inverted. This is either because yields on longer term bonds are falling or yields on short term bonds are rising. What's happening here is that investors are willing to accept lower yields on longer term bonds because they think that at some point interest rates will fall enough to mitigate the risk of inflation.

Eg if investors think that within 2 years there'll be a slow down that will incentivise the central bank to drop interest rates to 0%, suddenly this makes the 5% they're currently getting on their 10year bond look very attractive. Demand for these bonds goes up and if you bought when the rate was 5% you can make a hefty profit.

This is why if investors fear an impending recession it might cause the yield curve to invert. 

There are other reasons though, and recessions haven't always followed from an inversion (eg 1966). One idea now is that quantitative easing has had a distorting effect on global asset prices and the normal rules of the game no longer apply. Equally since the crisis new regulations have come in that require pension funds to hold more of their funds in bonds, which pushes down the price (and lowers the yield).

One thing I don't understand is how, if all this is true, the yield curve inversion is basically a reflection of investor sentiment. They think the Fed will drop rates relatively soon, so demand for bonds with maturities longer than that time frame goes up.

But as we all know, recessions are incredibly difficult to time. If they weren't they wouldn't come as a shock and nobody would lose money. 

So if bond investors are consistently predicting recessions with accuracy then why does everything go to shit in a recession? Is there a cabal of bond investors who are consistently predicting them with ease?",finance

I was thinking of applying for the Disover it Student Cash Back card. I am a full-time undergrad with a part time job, and I just want to use the card for everyday expenses so I can get rewards for spending money I was going to spend anyway. I also want to raise my credit score.

I have spent 8 hours today at my new job trying to understand how taxes for 1099 vs W2 work. I understand the different terms and the percentages but not their application.

I am an independent contractor at this job so I have to pay my own taxes. Well I can't understand this paystub at all it makes no sense.

https://i.imgur.com/8fVczbh.png

The Fed MED/EE Tax rate is 2.9 percent of gross income. Why does my paystub show half of that taken out already? Everything I read says I have to do it myself, yet there 1.45% of it is gone? 

The Fed OASDI/EE is charged takes a percentage of  your gross income, and if you’re an employee that percentage is removed  automatically out of your paycheck. Currently, the Fed OASDI/EE tax is 6.2 percent. Why does my paystub show that taken out already? I just don't get it. Each website and post I read overcomplicates everything.

Am I completely misunderstanding everything I am reading about taxes or does something look wrong here? Am I getting screwed more than an independent contractor already does? Can someone please just explain to me in English what my damn tax obligations are on this one, single paystub so I can have at least an idea of what is to come?

P.s.: I am aware 16$ an hour sucks. Thanks.

personalfinance,Best way to use Americorps Education Award?,"I just completed my second and final year with Americorps and thus have been awarded an education award of about $5900. 

The way I see it, I have two options: 

1) I can apply the entire award at once to my student loans (current balance of about $21000), and then start making payments out of pocket in October when my forbearance runs out. My loans are all federal loans, and my financer estimates payments of about $200/month, which will be difficult but not impossible to make. 

2) I can use the award to make my monthly payments starting in October, which will cover me for about 2.5 years, but my overall interest will be a little higher. 

I'm a teacher, and I don't make a very big paycheck, roughly $2000/month, and I also have all the bills a normal person would pay, which leaves me with about $300 to save at the end of each month. Once I have to start paying my loans, that'll go down to about $100/month. My current loans are [here](https://imgur.com/a/yhLfKO1). 

Would it be better to use the education award to make my monthly payments, or to just bring the whole balance down at once? If it's better to just pay the loans off all at once, to which loans should I apply my balance?",finance

personalfinance,"How often should you change the car you lease, and can you renegotiate the APR?","I purchased a two year old Bmw on January this year and went with the hire purchase option. I did this because I wanted to not have to stress about the car breaking, and in general was fed up of looking for a used car from a private person. I’ve had the car for 6 months and have been happy but I’m starting to reconsider if it was a good choice, so here’s some questions (PS I am UK based)

1: how often should I change the car? 
I bought a two year old as I did not want to take the initial price loss. I know they put a mark up on the car anyway, but how long should I keep this car and when should I think about changing it and for what year car should it be? 

2: can I renegotiate the APR?
Call me an idiot, but I wanted this car no matter what and the lowest they offered me was 12.9% initially. Once I checked with local banks, I was offered 8% which they managed to match. I know this is a high APR, but could I go back now and renegotiate? Of perhaps I say I want to buy the car out as the bank is giving me a better rate? 

I’ve even considered just giving it back and buying a car outright, but I’m going to be honest i don’t know how it all works, so will I get the £2000 deposit back or any of the months I have pay for? Or does it depend on the value of the car? 
I currently pay £290 a month for this car, which isn’t much as I bring around £2000 a month home. Thanks",finance

btc,"If cryptocurrencies are so good, why are so many governments don't like it?","**If people use bitcoins, instead of the state currency, the government can not ""tax"" them or give a ""value"" through the inflation ""tax""**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/q950vpvf6z931.jpg

The key to its success is something called the blockchain. The blockchain is a means of solving the double-spending problem: which is that because the currency is digital it is open to being copied and spent more than once - something banks stop with physical currency.

However, the blockchain acts as a digital ledger, whereby every single transaction (called a block) is securely linked together using cryptography and encryption. It's verifiable, available to everyone who owns Bitcoin and is immune to fraud and hacking - unlike centralised banks.

It enables one digital wallet (that can be stored on a phone) to directly connect with another securely and process a transaction.

If virtual currencies are so good, why are so many governments with the flea behind their ears? The Chinese government is embarking on a crusade against bitcoin. In India, the situation is not much different. There are other examples. Because?

The potential benefits of crypto-coins are real. Governments around the world are full of debt. Many of them will hardly be paid. Brazil( My country) is not an isolated case. Europe has a very serious social security problem. Governments promised worlds and funds. But their populations are aging. And, at the same time, fertility is falling. The account will not close.

What does a government do when it does not have the money to pay? Sell ​​tomorrow's lunch to pay for today's dinner. Some governments have been able to play this game for decades. So the scheme is so attractive.

For governments that manage to issue debt in their own currency, gambling is even more interesting. If or when investors are unwilling to hold public debt securities in the portfolio until their maturity, these governments that take debt in their own currency may call for creative mechanisms to ""monetize"" debt.

To ""monetize"" public debt, the key is to give liquidity and certainty attributes that equate government bonds with monetary instruments. For example, governments do this with funds from the Money Market. The key is always to find ways to get people to use government bonds as ""money.""

&amp;#x200B;

**But there comes a time when lenders lose confidence and stop rolling over debt. What's up?**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/6q69leeh6z931.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

Here governments can issue money directly. They can finance their debt with monetary printing. It's a default of a different kind. The trick is inflation. Today, you have $ 100 in your wallet. With that money, buy ten packets of a wafer. If the price of the wafer package doubles, you will still have $ 100 in the wallet. But your buying power will fall by half.

What if you have a government debt bond instead of a $ 100 bill (or deposit)? In developed countries, government debt is not indexed. So inflation works, solve the problem of the Treasury.

But in others (as in Brazil), there may be indexation. Then the government bond will pay inflation for the period + x%. How to pay off this debt? It is only passing a law changing the rule of correction of the titles. Or make a compulsory loan. Or freeze deposits. Or make a board. There will always be a cunning economist and a good talk advocate to wrap the fish. And it's not just in Brazil!

This is where the magic of cryptos begins to function. If people use bitcoins, instead of the state currency, the government can not ""tax"" them or give a ""default"" through the inflation ""tax"". State tricks do not work with bitcoin.

This is the first reason why having crypto-coins may be a good idea: it is insurance against government insolvency. Since the world is a world, governments break down periodically (especially after losing a war - more on the subject, below). Having crypto (especially a bitcoin type crypto), as well as having physical gold, is insurance against state insolvency.

But the advantages of cryptos exist not only for moments of catastrophe or crisis. Cryptos have advantages also in times of normality. They are, in principle, safer and cheaper than other forms of payment.

Crypto operations cannot be undone. You are not at risk of having your credit card cloned. The transactions are settled immediately in the blockchain. There are no fees. And it is possible to implement smart contracts schemes that better lubricate human collaboration. Wonderful!

There is more: today there are more than 2 billion people with access to the internet or smartphones. And the number just grows. The advantages of crypto-coins are then extended to all this sea of ​​people! And it is possible to include - banking, bring into the 21st century - an even larger contingent of people. Is not it great?

&amp;#x200B;

**In the view of governments, it may not be. There are four main challenges: monetary policy, taxation, exchange, and systemic risk.**

&amp;#x200B;

**1 -**

Monetary policy. Without a national currency, in times of crisis, the government can not finance its debt via monetary printing. Imagine a farm minister from a country where the money is lacking for everything. If things get too tight, there's only one way: to get the mint gang to work ... But if people's savings are in bitcoin, that old technique will not work!

In case of war, the impossibility of using monetary printing can have a dramatic dimension. Historically, warring governments have had to print money because it is never possible to raise taxation too quickly in too short a time. It is good to sow peace in the world. But from the point of view of national states, monetary printing has always been seen as a dimension of national sovereignty to deal with external aggression.

&amp;#x200B;

**2-**

Taxation. Modern governments are brutal spenders. You may think this is good - after all, the state of social well-being is expensive but it delivers health, education, transportation ... Well, in Brazil it's not quite like that. In international comparison, our state spends a lot, and it spends very badly. But let us leave this Brazilian ""detail"" aside. The fact is that governments of social welfare are expensive.

Well, how to pay the bill? A party may eventually be thrown into the lap of future generations via state indebtedness. But the bulk has to come from today's taxation. It is here that the crypto-coins put the rulers of hairs on their feet. Crypto-coins can make it difficult for state taxation. Mainly because they can be used to launder money.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/6wexycvi6z931.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

Some say that this type of problem can be remedied with measures such as those recently adopted by the Federal Revenue Service. Globally, the Libra of Facebook, when it comes to work, will have to facilitate the tracking of the identity of the holders of Libras. Will it work? Can be. Time will tell. But the fact is that governments are animals hungry for people's resources. It's hard to hold them.

&amp;#x200B;

**3 -**

Exchange. The exchange rate, after the basic interest, is the main price in an economy. To value it, devalue it, revalue it, this is the breadwinner of many government economists around the world. (A joke says that the exchange was invented to humiliate economists because controlling it and predicting its fluctuations is so difficult.) But the fact is that the implementation of all these challenging activities is easier as long as the state currency is used by all. What if she is not?

Notice that in Brazil we have exchange controls. It is no longer the madness of the military time, when even to buy dollars to go to Bariloche with the family on vacation the Brazilian citizen had to make guts to buy the rationed currency ... And everyone ended up in a doleiro. Things have changed. But there are still various controls and barriers. Will, the government gives them up?

&amp;#x200B;

**4 -**

Systemic risk. This problem is more subtle and the analysis depends on the type of cryptocurrency. Think of the Libra (in the case of bitcoin the analysis would be quite different). This is a stable coin managed by Facebook. From what has been announced, the Pound will work with full ballast. That is, Facebook will create a Pound only when it receives the corresponding state currency. Very good.

But the problem is that the settlement of Libras operations will have to be done through digital wallets. Will these digital wallets work like banks? Will they resolve to give credit based on the floating of deposits received? If this happens, the systemic risk focus that is on banks today will simply migrate to digital wallets. What if digital wallets break: who will bail them out? The Seventh Cavalry?

Trading,S&amp;P 500: Significance of the U.S-China Trade Talks,"The U.S and China trade negotiations have been going on for quite a while now, exhibiting ups and downs when it comes to the state of negotiations and at some point even appearing as if the hopes of arriving to a deal has grown dim. For the time being, talks between the two countries have been proceeding, yet no one could ever be certain as to what direction it may swing. People who trade the S&amp;P 500 index must remain watchful of the state of these trade talks since this proves to be a significant factor to move the S&amp;P 500. 

Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the chief equity strategist at J.P. Morgan stated in an interview that if a resolution is achieved between the two economies, the stock index could experience an upside of 800 points and could undergo an increase to 3,200-3,300. Lakos-Bujas, proceeded to state that right now, “Markets are on thin ice,” because of the possible effects of these conferences. The outcome of a resolution would indisputably bring positive news for market participants, but at the same time, there is also a risk of negotiations proving unsuccessful. This could  bring a downside to 2,500 for the index and would cause a 16.6% drop from its record closing high achieved on the 3rd of this month.

If the U.S. successfully arrives at a trade deal with China, it would give way to lessening trade barriers and provide assurance for U.S companies when it comes to their trade policies into the future. According to Lakos-Bujas, the importance of this deal overshadows even the Federal Reserve’s decision regarding their monetary policy or the results of the second quarter earnings being announced next week. This is  substantial enough to have a great amount of impact, even more than the corporate tax cut introduced back in 2017.",finance

personalfinance,(US) Moving expenses depleted my savings. My credit score keeps dropping. What to do?,"Its been a rough couple of months. I finished grad school in December and moved to a new city for a great job that I've been working at for a month now. The job and the city is great and I absolutely love it.

I am at the cheapest place I can afford, living as minimally as I can, and changed my Loan payments to 25 years instead of 10 for around $500 per month. Grace period ended and mandatory payments just started last month. (I currently owe just shy of $100,000 in federal loans undergrad + grad school combined). But the initial logistics of the move were more costly than I expected and I had to use a big chunk of my already scarce cash savings.

I have gotten my first two paychecks and I have a little bit of breathing room now as I am making good money ($65k for full time hours. I am wage and can work as little or as much as 40 hours per week). Right now I am just having trouble allocating my savings for big mandatory payments such as my rent $1000/month and loans $500/month. So for the past two months i have been paying the minimum on my credit card payments.

But my credit score has been steadily dropping and I am freaking out. I always prided myself in a high credit score because I knew if I was in trouble financial wise my credit would be able to help me. And it is plummeting big time.

It was at a high of 760 before I moved. Credit Karma Vantage shows it dropped 30 points last month to around 720 and a whole 60 POINTS down to 670. 670!!! Its never been that low.

My Discover and Wells Fargo FICO scores are more favorable but still showing decline. They are at 727 and 723 respectively. I expect them to drop lower too if I don't change things.

Obviously the rent payments wont end, the loan payments wont end and thats as cheap as I can get them. I have steady income coming in but feel like I am always behind and paying catchup from the initial move. I know my score is dropping due to the increasing balances on the credit cards and paying the minimums, as well as the increasing loan amounts and my overall Debt to Income ratio but I need the little cash I have for rent/loans and as an emergency fund.

What do I do to keep my score from dropping? Is it possible I can get it back up to the mid 700s soon?",finance

Just a brief introduction, I am 24 years old with a Supply Chain Management degree from a top 5 program in the US.
With that being said, I have received two offers after leaving a previous company of a year.
Offer 1: Aerospace &amp; Defense - private sector Base Salary: $55,000 paid semi-monthly 401K: Match 150% up to 8% !!! after 1st year. Vested 100% after 5 years. 3 weeks vacation, all federal holidays Tuition reimbursement to pursue Master's Med/Dental/Vision State income tax. 10 hours away from parents. 6 hours away from girlfriend / future fiancé
Offer 2: Commodity company. Public sector Base salary: $65000 paid weekly 401 K: Match 100% for 1st percent and 50% the next 5%. Vested 100% after 2 years. 2 weeks vacation and 10 holidays. No tuition reimbursement. Med/Dental/Vision No state income tax. 4 hours from parents. 30 min from girlfriend / future fiancé
I am most likely going to choose option 2 and I keep telling myself not everything is about money, but that 401K plan is hard to turn down. But I am wanting to be mindful that my parents won't be here forever and would like to be around them for my earlier career years. My plan is to work for option 2 for at least two years to gain the experience and get a feel for where I would become stagnated in the company, then pursue other options if necessary.
I will be still contributing to a personal Roth IRA.
Also, girlfriend will be graduating after one more year of uni with a Business Analytics degree and will most likely be making equivalent to me if not more.

\-Age 26

\-Married

\-Employment: Military 

\-Income(Regular Military Compensation): 77k

\-Currently living in Europe

Assests

\-Brokerage account: 107k in a total stock market/bond fund mix

\-Retirement: 78k in TSP(401k) and two IRAs

\-Whole life insurance: cash value of 29k which i plan to cash out and throw into the brokerage account.

\-Not gunna include any depreciating assets(vehicles, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

THE GOAL: Retire in 20 years at 46

&amp;#x200B;

THE PLAN:

\-Invest 31k every year into retirement which will be maxing 401k and two IRAs

\-Retirement accounts are currently ALL Roth

\-Whatever left over throw into the brokerage account

\-When i leave the military roll over all my ROTH TSP into my ROTH IRA accounts

\-From the years 46-59.5 live off the ROTH Contributions(31k) plus whatever is my brokerage account.

&amp;#x200B;

THE MATH

\-If i max retirement from now until age 46, given 7% returns, i will have approx. 1.6mil.

\-I will then start withdrawing 31k(you can withdraw roth contributions penalty free) yearly from retirement 

\-Even with withdrawing 31k yearly, at 7% return, the retirement account will have 3.2mil at age 59.5

\-For my brokerage account, even if i do not touch it for the next 20 years, at 7% return, it will be approx. 414k.

\-for the years 46-59.5 i will live off 31k(roth contributions) plus the 414k in brokerage.

\-None of these values include my 401k matching, the life insurance money being added to brokerage, or if i increase deposits to brokerage throughout the next 20 years.

&amp;#x200B;

THE PROBLEMS

\-not easy to max retirement, but i believe if i can do it with my current income i should be able to with my future xpected income increases as well.

\-Saving for a house down payment:  I have access to the VA loan.

\-Children:  I do not plan on having more than 2, however this will still raise my expenses absolutely

&amp;#x200B;

THE QUESTION

\-Will this plan work?? I welcome any criticism or feddback.",finance
investing,Is this even possible?,"We all know the US is in trillions of dollars in debt, student loan debt are reaching an all-time high at 1.56 trillion. Student loans are mostly backed by co-payers or/and the federal government. Can the government bundle these debts into a BTO/CDO and sell it to the big banks or private corporations? They can bundle some national debt along with student loan debt. If I have my fact straight, the government sells bonds to people to fund some, if not most of their spending. So I guess I am just trying to figure, what happens if the government can't pay back these people? Can the government default on their debts, to put it plainly. Enlighten me, please. Thanks",finance

personalfinance,"Pre-retirement father wants to resign by the end of the month, any consequences we should be aware of?","Hi all, long time lurker but really new to the finances game so please bear with me.

My father (age 59.5) is fed up with his job and after 20+ years of work with very little trouble (and what I've heard to be of good work ethic and reputation) was suddenly put on a week suspension. It's not a secret that the new management is (IMO) making things purposefully difficult for him to make him screw up and thus get written up, but that's a discussion for a different thread. Anyway he's making plans to resign by the end of the month and is planning to withdraw a portion of his 401k for emergency medical expenses by next year to avoid income taxes and the pre-retirement penalty. Because of my limited knowledge on the matter, I'm urging him to speak to a financial advisor about his future game plan and how to make his finances last but he's being a little resistant. So far, my mother and I are working full time so expenses will not be too problematic for right now. Of course I know it'd be best to talk to a professional about his specific circumstances, but are there any things we should be aware of and account into our game plan? Would appreciate any advice!

personalfinance,Using trade act to fullest extent?,"Hey all,

I will be laid off from my job at a major furniture manufacturer in 5 months. I am married and still live with family that has been somewhat supportive but doesn't have a great track record for really helping us all that much. My wife is type-1 diabetic and needs medical supplies so insurance is a must. We will both be 23 and 25 come time for the layoff.

I owe approximately $9479 at the moment and have roughly 7K in a profit sharing 401K account + my own personal employee match 401k. My mom has made it clear she will help to support us so that I can pay as much of my debt off as possible. $2081 of my debt is a 5% interest rate personal loan with unemployment insurance added. After 5 months this will be paid down to 1250 roughly, making just the minimum payment and tackling my car loan ($3800) and a high interest credit card 26% apr ($3000). I plan to tackle the credit card first.

I currently pull in $797 biweekly after all deductions (Have made $15.55-17.05 since working here for going on 5 years). My company may offer us a severance of either a week for every year or 2 weeks for every year of pay. It'll probably be in the range of $2000-3000. I will also be cashing in a week of vacation that I have accrued.

I put in for VA unemployment before for plant shutdowns and received $350 a week after federal tax. At the time since the shutdowns were just temporary, we didn't have to actively head hunt.

My car can be sold and has offers for $7500~ although it is something I feel personally attached to since I have worked on it and it is somewhat of a gem. I already have offers for it but I turned them down because I figured I'd need to be a little more desperate before cutting that excess. I have 2 other cars for my wife and I, one of which isn't the most reliable.

My intention is to try and get my wife medicaid coverage while we both attend school full time. Neither of us have our parents as options for health insurance and no way can we afford cobra. Her medical supplies on my employee insurance have been quite expensive (Just paid $800 out of pocket for a new insulin pump). We have handled literally I feel like everything in our young adulthood that needs to be handled with the exception of schooling.

I have minor college certificates for Industrial Maintenance and pursued Electronics while working full time but now may consider pursuing Engineering. My wife is pursuing her RN, starting in August. I know these certificates can only make me but so marketable. I want this opportunity to end up being a good thing for us and as we qualify for the trade act, I would like to pursue as much profitable schooling as possible which may mean returning to Electronics/Electrical Engineering which I have 5 more semesters of. Will the trade act pay out my unemployment benefits while I pursue this option and do you think medicaid will be welcoming of our request? I have worked my ass off physically and mentally for 5 years and all I have ever wanted is an education.

Do you think I am on the right path?",finance

personalfinance,Pay off rental mortgage or invest elsewhere,"I recently inherited some money and now I'm trying to decide what I should do with it.

I could go the usual route and open an investment account/buy a CD, however, combined with other savings my wife and I have we could pay off the remaining mortgage on the rental property we have held on to since 2008.

The mortgage is a variable-rate, currently at 5.125%.  For most of the past 16 years it has been below 3.5%.  If I pay this off is it essentially the same as investing the money at a similar rate?  The rental essentially breaks even.  Looses a little at the current interest rate.  Not carrying a mortgage would definitely make it a net-positive to our income.

Are there any tax pitfalls I need to worry about other than loosing the deductible interest, which I don't know is a huge benefit?

I don't think we will keep the rental property forever but at least another 5 years.  We will probably sell it and purchase a short-term rental/retirement property at some point.

Also, just for thoroughness, we don't carry any other debt besides a mortgage on our primary home and we have a decently funded emergency account.

personalfinance,HELP! Girlfriend got suckered into a bad car loan. Whats her next steps?,"My girl went to a car dealership looking for a car, because a friend had told her they could get anyone into a car. My girl has very bad credit, and a minimum wage job (she lives with me, and Ihelp support her). Turns out, it was the last day that branch of the dealership was going to be open, and it was close to closing time, so I think they wanted to squeeze out one more sale on her. She told them she wouldnt be able to afford more then $250/mo, that she had bad credit, and she had paystubs demonstrating how much she made. She didn't really understand anything they told her, other than if she signed they'd give her a car. Lo and behold, two weeks late when she gets her paperwork from the loan company, her payments are $550/mo, her interest rate is above 20%, and the full warrenty they told her as included was actually an additional $200/mo. There's no way she can affort this car, even with my help. She's now a week late on her first payment, the dealership she bought from is now over 2 hours away, and she doesnt know what to do. She traded in her car for the down payment for this, so loosing the car means she's without transportation. Would it be possible to switch the loan to a cheaper car from the same dealership, or should she just give the car up, take the hit, and look for something else?",finance
personalfinance,What gets taxed as ‘personal income’?,"I’m 21 and in the US, and I’ve only started teaching myself personal finance (its a long story, but one reason I’m dealing with my financial illiteracy so late is because I’ve been studying in the UK for the past few years and never had to focus on establishing anything in the US).

So I’m learning how tax brackets work and that you basically have to pay taxes on all income, but what counts? I understand how full time income would be taxed, but what about the kind of money I want to earn over the summer?

I’m doing an irregular part time job where my friend’s mom pays me to house/pet-sit. $45/day, but only for a few days per week, and only until September. Does that get taxed? 

I’m simultaneously doing an internship where I get paid a flat $200 at the end of the program. Is that taxable?

I write, and if I won a contest or published my work in magazines and got like $100 from that, would that be taxable? 

I heard that you don’t have to pay (or at least file) taxes for any amount under $12,000/ year, as that is usually what is deducted anyway, but does that mean I have to keep track of all my odd jobs throughout the year and make sure my TOTAL income from these  doesn’t go above $12,000?

At the same time, the federal tax bracket for 2019 shows you still have to pay 10% for any income below $9,700 so is the ‘not pay if income is under $12,000’ not even true/applicable?

personalfinance,Have some questions on what I should do with my house.,"Hey all, I was hoping to get some advice on my house. I purchased the house about 5 years ago for $137,000 with a 4.75% interest rate. It's a relatively nice and quite neighborhood and the houses here usually sell pretty fast. Lately I have noticed a lot of my neighbors moving out, and new ones moving in. Out of curiosity I asked my real estate agent what my house was worth, as I have been toying with the idea of refinancing to see about a lower rate. He came back with an estimate of around $170,000.

&amp;#x200B;

With this information I have thought about a couple of scenarios, and I really just don't know what I should do..or if they even make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Refinance, get a lower rate (I have very strong credit, 1 bank came back with 4.25% which is not as low as I hoped).
2. Rent my house out, and get another. This has become an unlikely scenario as I'd only get about $1200/mo in rent.
3. Sell it. Toss the equity in high interest savings and use that to subsidize the cost to live somewhere else.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of all the above listed scenario, refinancing is the one I seem most attracted to IF I can get a better rate, but I didn't know if someone else had better advice for me.",finance
personalfinance,Removing one person from a joint credit card?,"About four years ago, my mom and I applied for a joint credit card at PNC. The idea was her excellent credit history would get me approved with a higher limit &amp; better interest rate, since I at the time was a college student with no income and wanted to build my credit history. I've been the only user of the card since, always paid the balance in full every month.

Now, I've graduated college &amp; have a well-paying job, so I wanted to remove my mom's name from the account. This is just for my own sense of independence- neither my mom nor I are worried about the other ruining our credit, we're both financially responsible and have a good relationship, so there's no pressing NEED to separate myself.

I assumed that since I can provide proof of income and now have a solid credit history,  we could go to the bank and sign something together to change the account from joint to single. We went to a PNC Bank and the teller informed us there's no way to remove one person from the card. He suggested I close that account and apply for a new card in only my name.

Here's the thing: that's my oldest account. It's also most of my available credit (I have one other store credit card, but it has a very low credit limit), and the relatively high limit is reason I can keep my credit utilization hovering around 10% each month. I know that closing this credit card would be a MASSIVE hit to my credit score.

Was the PNC Bank guy correct? Is there no way I can separate myself from my mom without closing the account and harming my credit score? How should I move forward from here to eventually be separate from her while salvaging as much of my credit as possible?",finance

personalfinance,Graduate School Planning,"Hi Everyone,

I’m going to be starting a M.S. in Information this upcoming fall and I’m trying to figure out the best path financially for the road ahead. A couple of things:

I will have ~14,500 in the bank at the end of the summer

I have ~12k in loans from undergrad (3-4% interest rate)

My tuition + books will be around 5.5k per semester.

My expected job out of college is as a software engineer where I anticipate starting around ~70k (maybe this is low? Not sure)

Here’s the dilemma. I want to have the best possible setup for grad school without accruing a ton of debt. The way I see it, I have 3 options for living/commuting needs:

Living options:
1. Stay with parents
Pros:
-no rent
-low food expense

Con:
-must commute to campus either 20 mins by car or 45 by bus

2. Live near campus:
Pros:
-close to campus so no need for car 
-no time spent commuting means more time available for working a part time job (which I intend to do)
Cons:
-hard to find cheap rent in Ann Arbor MI area. 
-food expense increases

Commuting options:
1. Car:

My car recently took a shit and needs to be repaired. I estimate the repairs will be $1500 to fix. 

Parking on campus is an absolute bitch to find. I don’t want to drive to campus and be left without a spot and be late to classes/exams. A permanent spot is pretty necessary and the rate for the garage is $250 a month. 

2. Bus:

It’s free for students! However I lose a LOT of time using the bus. This is time that could potentially be used working a part time job.

Is it a dumb decision financially to take out loans given my current financial position? I have the option of paying down a full year and only having $22k in loans upon graduating. Additionally, I’ll be getting income from part time jobs/internships in between summers. Should I be concerned about being $34k in the hole if I do take out loans for all 4 semesters if I anticipate making $70-80k postgrad?",finance

Humans have allowed despotic governments to impose dictatorships over money. The closest thing we had to money was **gold**.
 
Gold’s utility as a monetary instrument derives from its **scarcity**. The confidence that we can’t easily inflate the stock of gold is why gold was useful for communicating value. In the same way that it’s hard to plan a road trip if the unit of distance fluctuated, the economy cannot make sound business decisions if money was unpredictable.

Bitcoin is the first **metric unit** for communicating value – amongst other features, Bitcoin is backed by its **confidence** in monetary policy.

Bitcoin,We need adoption now!,"I can’t even begin to tell you how mad I am right now. It’s taken a while to get to this point, with a myriad of issues accumulating over years time, but today was the straw that broke my back, not the camel’s.

The Banks which control 99.99% of the flow of money are FUCKING US ALL, and laughing in our faces while doing it. I need to pay for something (international transaction in EU), but for some reason they aren’t allowed to accept Credit Cards/PayPal since it is a preorder. (Dictated by laws or whatever). The only way you can pay is with a bank transfer, aka wire. (The company product is 100% legit, I’ve done business with them many times.)

So I go online in my banking app to do a wire transfer. Well apparently you cannot do it online, so I call my bank’s 14 hour customer service line.

“Sorry Sir, but to do a wire transfer you need to visit one of our physical branch locations and complete it there.”

“But I need to submit it now as it is a time sensitive payment, and it’s Sunday so none of your branches are open.”

“Yes, unfortunately you will have to wait until regular Branch hours on Monday morning. Is there anything else I can help you with today?”

I hung up on them after that because I didn’t want lash out on this dude who was just relaying the policies that someone else made, but boy was I ready to. I calmed down and looked at my other checking accounts policies on wire transfers (different banks). My hope was restored after a customer service rep told me that she could do it over the phone any time today. Then I realized that I would need to deposit/transfer money into that account in order to do it, because it is just a placeholder account with $20 in it so I can use the Credit Union’s other services. I’d use that bank full time (NavyFed Credit Union), but there aren’t any locations near me whatsoever.

So I logged back into my main account and went to transfer some money into the NavyFed one. What’s that you say, I won’t receive the funds for at least 24 hours? You are fucking kidding me! I can’t even access my own fucking money to buy something. Just like with private keys, you have no money if the bank has it. They have it, and they determine when you can and cannot utilize it. They also can decide who you can or cannot send your money to (like not allowing customers to buy crypto with their own money since crypto poses a threat to the bank’s total control).

Oh, and don’t forget about how they fucking rape the shit out of you with Fees and Charges. I need to spend $25 just to wire the fucking money! Just this week they also charged me $15 for a “maintenance fee” and $1 for a “paper statement fee”. That is $41 fucking dollars in less than 5 days just for me to be able to use my own fucking money. It is fucking theft, plain and simple, but rather than getting robbed by some junkies in ski masks, we get robbed by fucks in suits who are rolling in cash.

We have self driving cars, rockets that can fucking land upright after falling from space, and satellites that can zoom in on a penny from outer space, but it takes DAYS just for me to send money to a European country. They are intentionally strangling us and our money. They want to keep total control, all while stealing from us along the way. A few bucks here, a few bucks there, $2 every time you withdraw cash, etc, etc, etc... It makes me think about the movie “Office Space”, when the dude steals a fortune by just scraping pennies off of millions and millions of transactions.

Enough is enough. WE NEED ADOPTION NOW. Mass adoption, not just a few random online shops and tiny restaurants. That is what Bitcoin was supposed to be about. We have strayed so far away from that, so much so that actual adoption (at least with bitcoin) will never happen. People have hoarded it, price fluctuation has scared so many, and the big institutions have infiltrated the system. When I first learned about bitcoin I believed in it; I saw how we needed a way to allow people to control their money. The message has always been there in my head, but it faded somewhat over time. Bears and Bulls, charts, developments, whales, and drama with Vermin and the delusional nutjob crybaby took over the limelight. The majority of people who are involved in crypto now are just gambling to make money. They don’t care about adoption; some might say they do, but it’s not really true. They just want to make big $$$, convert to USD, and lambo through life. Hell, prior to today, I was like that for the most part. I always wanted to see progress, but I envisioned myself hitting a high point and pulling out almost everything and cashing out to USD.

Today was my true day of awakening. I learned about bitcoin and it’s goals/purpose years ago, and have been involved ever since. It sounds stupid, but I just now feel like I’ve reached true enlightenment (in terms of believing in the concepts that Satoshi Nakamoto(s) built upon). My involvement in bitcoin is going to change from watching charts and chasing profits to doing WHATEVER I CAN to push back in the face of the banks and give people real control over their money. Prices shouldn’t be what’s in focus, real adoption should. Bitcoin might not be the answer to this issue because of the issues I talked about above. If that’s the case, the solution has yet to be made. Bitcoin’s white paper is a great (currently the best too) foundation . Down with the banks.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Questions about Vanguard Company Sponsored Retirement Plan,"I recently graduated from college and began working full time at the company that I've been interning with for this past year. Since I am now a full time employee, I'm now eligible to sign up for the company's retirement plan through Vanguard. However, I'm a bit confused about the different types of assets to which I can allocate my contributions. 

The assets I can choose from under the core investments category are [company name] Stable Value, Institutional Total Bond Market Index Trust, Target Retirement Trust (there's like 12 of these, I'm not really sure what the difference is between them), Institutional Extended Market Index Trust, Institutional 500 Index Trust, PRIMECAP Fund Admiral Shares, FTSE All-World ex-US Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares, International Growth Fund Admiral Shares. There are also some bonds and stocks in supplemental investments category (Loomis Sayles Core Plus Fixed Income D, Wellington CIF II TIPS S1, Dodge &amp; Cox Stock Fund, T. Rowe Price Small &amp; Mid-Cap Core Trust D, DFA Emerging Markets Core Equity Portfolio Institutional Class, [company name] Common Stock Fund), but I'm not really sure how they're different from the bonds and stocks in the core investments.

My mom told me that I should just allocate my entire contribution to whichever asset has a fixed interest rate. Would this be the Stable Value asset? It seemed like all the other options had a variable rate of return. I feel that it might be a bad idea to just put all of my contribution towards one asset though? I've heard that when you're younger it's better to invest in higher risk/higher return assets like stocks, but quite frankly I don't like the idea of high risk investments. Would it be feasible to allocate my contributions to just the Stable Value asset and some of the bonds? 

If I choose one of the stock assets would I be able to choose to only invest in stocks for companies that are a bit more stable and established (AKA not tech companies)? Or are these stock assets like mutual funds where there's a predetermined collection of stocks that you must invest in and if they so happen to have a stock for a company you don't want in the collection, you don't have the option to opt out of just that one company's stocks?

From what I understand after reading the links in the PF Wiki, the Target Retirement Trust is an investment that adjusts itself to be lower risk as you get older. Once I lock the target year I want to retire, will I be able to change it in case I end up retiring earlier or later? Or is it possible to contribute to multiple target funds with different target years? Also Vanguard provided 12 different options for the Target Retirement Trust, what key parameters should I be looking at when comparing the difference between them?

Also I had a few questions about the process for the annual contribution increase. If I choose to opt out of the automatic annual increase, will I be able to increase the amount I contribute later manually? Also in a similar vein, would I be able to decrease the amount I contribute? This year, I plan on contributing 30% of my income since I currently still live with my parents. My workplace is very conveniently located nearby so figured I'd save on rent, especially since the city I'm in has a high cost-of-living. However, I'd imagine I would like to use some of my income towards renting my own place in the future, so I'd be nice to be able to decrease my contributions later.

Sorry for all of the dumb questions and wall of text! I've tried my best to understand these assets through the fund profiles on Vanguard, but I feel like there's a lot of stuff I'm misunderstanding. Any clarification or ELI5 resources to better understand these assets will be greatly appreciated! I did try searching through previous r/personalfinance posts using the keyword ""Vanguard"", but only found Roth IRA stuff, so if there's some other keyword I should be using to search for advice on this matter, please let me know.

financialindependence,FIRE while working in public/govt sector - who else is pursuing it?,"Wife and I are 25, making AU$52 and 60k/yr respectively and living in Sydney, Australia (HCOL. Almost VHCOL.) We've read a lot of posts from people working in high-income jobs, including some working insane hours or hustling to get up the corporate ladder so they can RE sooner, but this isn't us: Wife is a speech/language pathologist working for the Department of Education, I'm a full-time middle manager working for a publicly-funded performing arts company. We both chose our careers because it mattered to us that we're doing something that helps others and/or makes the world a nicer place, and we both want our work to be rewarding, rather than waiting until we're FI and retired to help other people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is anyone else here pursing FIRE while working for government or in public sector? How do you work towards FIRE when your income potential isn't limitless and working harder won't achieve a better financial outcome? Has anyone moved into private sector/more profitable work because of this - are we just being naive?**

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Lots of amazing feedback from US govt. workers - it sounds like you have got it sorted! Wife will almost certainly not be eligible for pensions as will likely eventually move to private practice where money is better for senior practitioners, but that's still a long way off. I wasn't clear in my own situation: Major arts companies are not technically government agencies and are instead independent companies which receive \~50-70% of their funding from state and federal government. Because of this arrangement, there's no pensions, no improved super/401k, and no health benefits, but our pay is directly tied to how much funding we get and so the ceiling is very low.  

&amp;#x200B;

We've got our numbers worked out and could FIRE by 50-55ish, but feel like the frugality needed over the next 25-30 years to make it work is going to be pretty frustrating. We both have modest tastes and aren't exactly keen to buy jet-skis, but knowing that the chances of our combined post-tax income exceeding AU$130k in a country where housing is insanely expensive is pretty frustrating.",finance

I haven't pulled out of any positions out of fear. I haven't bought any new stocks in a while (mostly because I don't see any value investments right now) and I've adjusted the mix of capital to have more conservative holdings (money market/Treasuries). So I've gotten a little more conservative.

Here's the problem: *EVERYONE* is doing this. Sure there are the folks over at /r/wallstreetbets who are like ""sell 12,000 shares of worm tea! buy 1,000 bitcoin! buy swaps on your mother's farts!"", but I'd have to think that most investors are sitting on a healthy liquid/near-liquid position because: (A) equities don't make sense right now; (B) interest rates are shite; (C) real property has fallen a little from 2018Q3 to now, but it's still pretty high; (D) anything I'm missing?

So here's my question. If everyone is sitting on some liquidity. Let's say there *is* a market pull back scenario in the next 6-12 months. Wouldn't those investors just deploy their capital, driving prices up again? What if we have a situation where there is pullback. People invest. Pullback reverses. Then what? Would the time it takes to re-deploy capital just coincide with economic recovery? What if that's just dead cat bounce on the way to the bottom?",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on whether/when to remodel kitchen,"Hey everyone, 

First time posting, with a sort of complex question. 

We currently own a home in a large city in the midwest, 216K, 4 bed, 1.5 bath, in a very desirable, walkable neighborhood (mortgage is $1280/mo.) Since moving in Aug of 2016, we've had a ton of major issues come up with the house (so much flooding, damages from weather, sewer back-ups, appliances dying, etc.) It has been a living hell since buying this house, and I could go on for hours about buying an old house..but that's for another post...

In Aug of 2017, we had to completely redo the full bathroom after every pipe burst or cracked, filling the walls and floor with water and therefore damaging every surface of the bathroom for months without our knowledge. Because of all of the previous issues, our emergency savings was completely gone, so we had to take out a loan (16k, 4%, 5 yrs) for the cost of the bathroom, and now have 12k left. There have been several other issues since then around the house, so we're having trouble keeping our emergency savings full. We're trying - its a battle. Husband recently rejoined the Army as a reserve officer to help supplement both of our full time jobs. We now make a combined 116k take home a year. We both get bonuses each year - I get between 5k-10k at Christmas, he gets 2-4k in April. We both have student loan debt, we pay about 820/mo for that. 

This winter, it was extremely cold, our pipes burst in the kitchen, and cracked most of the tiles on the floor of the kitchen. They're chipping away into sharp pieces even with a rug over it, we have two kids under 6, and it's honestly kind of dangerous. Insurance company has given us 5k to replace the tile, but the contractor is saying we have to replace a section of the lower cabinets, plus the entire counter-top because whoever re-did the kitchen in the 80's pulled the original cabinets out, then re-installed the old, 1930's cabinets over a new floor. 

We're considering just re-doing the entire kitchen to modernize it, especially given that we plan to stay here for a long time, but are trying to weigh the pros and cons. We think we can do it for under 20k, definitely less than 25k, especially with the boost from the insurance company and that we don't need new appliances. It looks like we could get a loan for that amount, interest rate under 5%, for a monthly of $600.  With our current bills, what we put into our 403b's, child care, monthly expenses for food/gas/etc, we have about 1100 available each month that we typically try to use for saving/paying down debts. 

Taking on this additional debt feels like a lot, but we feel kind of stuck - if we just update the floors right now to repair the cracks, we're still going to pay money out of pocket (probably 2-4k), and if we ever did want to re-do the kitchen, any work we do now will have to be re-done according to the contractor. 

Some of the questions we're asking ourselves that we'd love to hear other's thoughts on:

- Should we go ahead and take out the loan and re-do the kitchen? An important note on this is that home values in our neighborhood have been increasing significantly. A smaller house down the street sold for over $300k.

- Should we try to aggressively pay down the bathroom, then do the kitchen once that debt is gone? (that'll take us between 6-12 months, most likely)

- Should we try to do something to just keep the floors from being dangerous for a while and really save to pay for the kitchen out of pocket? (The contractor didn't seem to think there's much we can do without just replacing the whole floor. He can't find the tile to match anywhere, after almost 4 months of looking. It'll take us 1-2 years, unless another job change occurred)

- Should we refinance? We have about 198k left on the home loan. It seems audacious to even consider this at this early stage of owning the home, but we've talked about it some. 

- Are there other questions/potential avenues we should consider?

personalfinance,"Pay off student loans or mortgage, or increase our down payment?","I’m finishing up graduate school and looking to move our family (me, my husband - both early 30s - and two small children) to a much higher cost of living area. I’m not sure of the best way to use our savings so we can purchase our next house.

Currently, we have $40k from an inheritance earning 2% in a money market account. Our emergency fund already has 6 months of expenses. We have an additional $150k or so put aside in investments/retirement (will not touch this!).

We owe about $16k in student loans. Mine ($7500, 6.8% interest rate) are still deferred and interest free for another year. We pay $250 a month towards them - $125 completely towards principle for mine and about $30 over the minimum payment (4.4% interest rate) for my husband’s. We have $51k left on our mortgage (3.75% interest rate), paying the minimum each month. When we sell, we should walk away with at least $130k to put down on the next house. No credit card debt, no car loans, etc.

We make about $85k right now but it’ll be more like $140-150k starting next year with the job I have lined up.

So my questions: what should we be doing with the $40k inheritance? Should we pay off the student loans or mortgage? Or use it to increase our down payment for the next house? From my calculations, we should be able to afford (and will need, much more expensive area) a house of about $350-400k with my new job. What’s the best way to set ourselves up to get preapproved for that amount at our current salaries? Any other advice on things we should be doing?

I'm leaning towards the 15.5kW system.  I should mention I'm in western Washington state, so hoping the larger system will give us enough banked credit (net metering) to last us through the fall/winter months.

Both of those quotes include $6k for replacing our old 60amp electrical panel with a 225amp panel. That $6k may be less if we determine we have enough amperage coming to the house already, I need to confirm with our utility company.

\- SilFab 310watt panels (flush with the roof, they determined no need to angle them)

\- SolareEdge inverters (possibly 2 since we are splitting the design on both east/west sides of roof, leaving room for expansion)

\- IronRidge XR100 Racking System

\- IronRidge Flashfoot 2 Mounting System

&amp;#x200B;

Now we also need a new roof prior to this and that's going to cost about $17k (max) in addition to the above prices.  The roof replacement is a need, but the solar panels are more of a want.

We currently use about 1,300kW of electricity each month on average (regular house stuff + 1 plug-in hybrid with 13.2kW capacity we charge daily). We have an old inefficient forced air gas furnace that uses a lot of electricity and we have not done anything to improve our house for energy (old lights, missing insulation, etc).

Total cost of our energy bill averages $205/month (this is electricity + gas, our furnace is the only gas using device in the house), which is $113 electricity and $92 gas.

Another thing, we are currently paying PMI ($205/month as well) and this solar project will allow us to remove the PMI payments (we'll go over the 80% loan to value mark).  Even at the lowest estimates the solar panel will give us enough value to remove PMI.  Of course we'll likely get PMI removed next year due to rising home values anyway, but would be nice to accelerate this.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I can't justify solar if my monthly payment is above what I currently pay for electricity.

I have $10k cash to put towards solar + roof and will pull the rest out of investments.  I figure I'll need $27k total for the 15kW system + roof.

Roof: $17,000k

Solar (after incentives): $30,470

Total: $47,470 (assuming we finance the entire roof and solar, which is just used for a base line comparison)

A 15 year loan at 3.5% is $ 348.76 /month, well over what we pay now.  So I was thinking of how to reduce this.

&amp;#x200B;

Paying cash for the roof ($17k)

$47,470 - $17k = $30,470

15 year loan at 3.99% = $223.86/month, but this is just for electricity, so we still have the $92/month average gas bill on top.  $315/month total compared to our current $205/month.  Still not there yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Now what if we replaced our gas furnace with a heat pump (side benefit, this would also give us A/C which we don't have currently and our 20 year old furnace would be replaced, as I doubt our current furnace will last 15 years without some kind of repair cost). I figure $6k for a heat pump.

$47,470 - $17k (cash for roof) = $30,740.  Plus an additional $6k for a heat pump (reducing our monthly bill by $92)

Now we are at $223.86 a month and this covers all our energy needs, this is a lot closer to our current $205.

So, how to get that reduced even more?

Do I stretch the loan out to 20 years and just pay it down sooner or do I put more money down up front?If I put another $5k towards solar (in cash):

Cost $53,470 (roof, solar, heat pump)

\-$17k (cash for roof)

\-$6k (heat pump)

\-$5k (cash towards solar)

Loan of $25,470 (and total cash investment of $28k)

15 year loan at 3.99% = $187.12/month fixed for 15 years, then free energy after that.

At this point, our PMI savings ($205) more than covers the cost of the loan for 15 years and we save an additional $205 for not having an energy bill anymore (from utility company, other than the $12/month connection fee or whatever it is).

&amp;#x200B;

I figure 15 years is a good number, in 15 years our youngest will be 18 and hopefully leaving the nest shortly. :)

&amp;#x200B;

Now...does it make sense to spend $28k cash + $25k loan  ($53,470 total) and get solar, roof, electrical panel and heat pump in return?  Also of the $28k cash, $18k of that is coming out of stock investments.

At $205/month average we are currently paying, with no rate increases this is $36,900 after 15 years (vs $53k if we go solar).  Granted I'm including the cost of roof in there.  Remove the roof cost and we have solar cost $36,470 over 15 years vs $36,900 current utility bill over 15 years (not including price increases of roughly 3.5%/year).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for long post, really just needed to get this all down in one place.  Do other people go through this process when deciding on solar?

Need some advice. I've just completed year one of my MBA program (fully paid for, a mix of my own savings and help from parents) and am trying to plan out how to pay for year 2. I have a few work-study jobs that will chip about $10k off my tuition, but will probably need another $70k or so to cover the cost. 

My fiancé and I trying to determine if the best course of action would be a) taking out federal loans with a 6.7% avg. interest rate or b) he would cover the tuition via cash he has on hand and then I would pay him back instead of paying back a federal loan. 

Our worry about using the cash is that it would leave us without substantial cash reserves for the next 3-5 years, which may become an issue as we consider buying property etc. However, avoiding the \~$20-25K we'd end up owing in federal interest might be worth it. 

Has anyone been through anything similar or have any advice on this? Any help about the pros &amp; cons or tax implications of either option would be hugely appreciated!

Bitcoin,Cryptocurrencies: A misunderstanding of necessity,"Bitcoin was originally created with transactions in mind as it had to be. Without working, secure transactions, it would have failed as a medium of exchange, and therefore would have been good at nothing.

I would argue that the side effect of the creation of Bitcoin, namely the massive hashpower, most decentralization, and immutable monetary policy is the real reason for its massive adoption.

The funny thing is, all these altcoins can claim to do better than Bitcoin is instant, low-fee transactions. However, this is missing the point. Cash and other payment processors can already do instant feeless transactions, so there is no reason to use something other than the already established system if that is all you care about.

The latest 'altcoin season' we saw was dumb money entering the market. 

I think the rise of shitcoins is forcing people to understand the difference between those, and Bitcoin. I predict this will cause Bitcoin to hit at least 80% market dominance before the next bull run takes it to 90.

I just graduated college and need to start paying my student loans, but I also want to enjoy within reason. I feel pretty bad about spending any money since I have debt, and I'm a little overwhelmed because I hoped that my parents would be able to contribute a little, but due to some economic hardship, they won't be able to.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently: 130k in student loans (30k in my name, 100 in my parents), with each loan around 3-5% interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still in the grace period (just graduated in May) and am working and will start my full-time job in a high COL area with NO income tax in a couple months.

&amp;#x200B;

By the end of the summer, I'll probably have about 25k in liquid assets from jobs I've worked since high school. My job pays about $105,000 and has pretty good benefits. I also get a signing bonus and some equity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Estimated monthly income after taxes &amp; 401K max:** $5700

**Monthly expenses:**

**Rent**: $1500

**Misc. Expenses** (Food, entertainment, toiletries etc): $1200 \[This is high but overestimating in case with moving expenses etc\]

**Travel** (to see SO) or dates when they visit: $250

**Loan Payments**: $1500

**Savings**: $1000

**Leftover:** $500 (leaving this as flexible money in case something is higher than I expect)

&amp;#x200B;

**My question basically is, is this a reasonable budget / repayment plan?**

* Should I clear out my current savings to pay the loans and just start fresh with the $1000 a month?
* How do I invest when all I have is $1000 a month in ""free"" money (should I split this up someway between savings and investing?)
* Any other lump sums - signing bonus or vested stock:  should I instantly cash out and put it into my loans?

personalfinance,Parent's Mortgage Assumption by Child over 18,"There are two options for my parents home mortgage that I need help understanding. The numbers used below are approximate. Some details may have been changed to protect privacy.






**Option 1**





Father owns a home worth 500k. The remaining mortgage balance is 250k. The current interest rate is 5% fixed. The mortgage company states the following clause:





If a child over 18 remains in the home as a primary residence, the mortgage company allows said child to assume the remaining mortgage. The company does require to child to credit qualify and pay a closing cost of approximately 5k (closing cost varies due to the market).




I searched the internet for the term ""credit qualify"" and could not find anything. What does this phrase mean? If they are asking if I qualify for a mortgage of 250k, the answer is no because I am a student and have minimal to no wages.





On one hand, we would like to remain with this company and this interest rate because they will allow for mortgage assumption by an over 18 child. On the other hand, the monthly payment is 2k which is very difficult for the father.





**Option 2**





The father has an option to refinance the mortgage with a different company. The new company will not allow mortgage assumption by a child. That is the downside. The benefit of the new company is that they approve a 3.5% fixed interest rate with a 3k closing cost. This would reduce the monthly payment to 1k.





The father is disabled, elderly, and only has social security retirement as his monthly income.





I am concerned about losing my family home. I understand that if the monthly payment is less, my father will be able to afford to remain in the home. My father's concern is that if I never have wages high enough to qualify to buy this house, we will lose our family home. While I may never have high enough wages to purchase the house, if I were to assume the mortgage, I could always cover the payment by having roommates. 





What is the best option?





TLDR: Need advice on mortgage options

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't expecting to need to move out quickly, so I'm not super prepared. I only really have enough money for first and last month's rent, and even that is a stretch. Also, my credit score is really bad, \~550.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I only have one source of credit history, which was a credit card that I got, pulled the cash advance from, and spent without paying back a dime. Eventually the account got charged off. Ridiculously stupid, I know, I don't have any excuses.

I really, really want to make this work, and stretch as hard as I can to finally feel independent for the first time in my life.

""How do you write a program that is autonomous, and would thwart economic policies set forth by the central bankers going forward?"". 2008 was probably big motivation to get it done. I think Satoshi is still alive. Literally told no one he was Satoshi. Hid the fuck out of his private keys, or even better destroyed them, to essentially guarantee the success of the project. By destroying his keys, he took himself out of the equation, so as not to be tempted to spend it, ever.  


Where charlatans like craig ""satoshi"" wright have it all wrong is that, the real satoshi never profited from Bitcoin.

This is going to be a bit of a novel as I lay out the potentially relevant facts of my life plan, so if you choose to read this whole thing, thank you very much for your time.  There are questions, delineated by subject matter, at the end involving joint homeownership, the mechanisms and maximums of taking loans from your 401k and other ways of paying for property, and the tax benefits of marriage, etc I might be missing.

Background/income:

I am a 22 year old baby banker who started work 2 weeks ago.  No debt (poor background, high tier college).  \~3.5k in liquid savings/checking.  85k/year guaranteed salary with annual significant salary raise (5-15% conditional on performance), end of year bonus (\~10k), and 2 year contract.  Reasonable expectation the 2 year contract will be extended into an AVP position with significant salary bump and better hours upon expiration.

I live in Manhattan, which means my rent is expensive as all hell, and taxes are a b\*tch, but given my work hours I don't have any other options - a commute over half an hour means giving up sleep.  Thus I have a 15 month lease.

GIRLFRIEND

I have moved in with my girlfriend of 3 years (she's 24), who will begin work as a medical scribe in 4 weeks ($15/hour, FT).  Her income is crap for the area but vaguely irrelevant - she just needs the last two classes she's in right now and patient contact hours for her PA school application.  Gets a $10k grant from Americorps for education, parents are willing to pay 10k/year, there's a scholarship with a 2 year contractual position lock in underserved areas in exchange for a free year of school, she's debt-free out of undergrad, and she's a signatory of my lease (and applying for that scholarship and renewing her license in NYC, etc.) for the purpose of gaining in-state tuition by next July.  We're probably looking at out-of-pocket costs around $35k to get her an advanced degree over the next 3 years, plus two years of low-pay rotations in an underserved area in North Manhattan/Queens following that (salary is tough to estimate - like 60-95k, 90-115k out of school).  We will use any government subsidized graduate loans and deferred-interest loan deals we can get unsecured which should knock that down to around 20k.  I am debating whether to pay this out of pocket myself in her final year or to get her unsecured loans - important later. (which, for the final year of PA school and given our joint financial health, should be easy).

ROOMMATE (the one that matters)

I have a roommate who is working through the same program at the same institution with the same time frame and the same pay/payscale/budget as me working a very similar job, though he has some student debt to work through over the next 2 years.  He has a long term girlfriend (been dating for two years) who is attending medical school close by in New Jersey, though she does not live with us.  We've known each other for about a year, and get along excellently.

BUDGET, MONTHLY

[https://imgur.com/IXY9736](https://imgur.com/IXY9736)

Yes, I know the Food/Drinks/Going Out is wicked high - I'm in the networking phase of a relationship-driven job and haven't settled into a full schedule yet.  This is a VERY conservative estimate with some mildly outlandish assumptions to make sure I'm on the safe side.  It is also inclusive of the \~$40 I spend on laundry and dry cleaning each month.

Rent is somewhat inflated as I am not including my girlfriend's income at all, covering her portion of it myself in this budget, and we have a free month amortized across 15 months.  It's closer to 1450 all in, but I'm including the face value here so you all understand the costs we're looking at and their relative sizes.  It cannot realistically be reduced beyond this point - I have 3 roommates and live with my significant other in what is reasonably close to the farthest commute I'm willing to have in the cheapest area with such a commute that all roommates including my girlfriend can commute from.

The mattress (along with mattress cover and pillows) is financed at 0% over 2 years, it was my splurge item when moving, because I spend 70% of my time outside of work in my bed.  It's worth it.

I am amenable to increasing retirement contribution annually as a percentage of pre-tax income from 6% to 10% or more, depending on answers to the following questions.  Yes, it's a bit low, but I value liquidity at the moment.  Contribution rn caps out the 100% employer match, dumped into passive funds (a blend of indexes domestic and international, 5% in bonds, weighted average expense ratio of .09%).

The net excess is basically all getting dumped into savings - mostly oriented towards liquid savings that will be converted to personal investment accounts until they are needed.  1/3 emergency fund will be held in cash, the rest in aggregate bond funds or low-beta sovereign bond indexes.  If I can access it for down payments and can save it more efficiently, however, I'm happy to hear advice on what to do with the excess savings.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTA BENE:

I have a two-year contract and a 15 month lease that will likely be extended a further year. Most of these questions are relevant on a 15 month to \~3.5 year time horizon, at which point myself, my girlfriend, and my roommate will all be sure of the dispositions of our own futures, both in terms of relationship with each other and income/educational futures, and can make informed decisions at that time.  I am not looking for advice about 'don't rush into things when you're 22' - this is in slightly over two years and VERY conditional on everything working out.  What I want to think about now is potential efficiency, funding costs, whether it's worth doing at all, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

QUESTIONS:

0) ADVICE

General Advice/Meal Prep: Advice on things in my budget that are particularly troubling that I didn't cover? Advice on cheap places to eat near midtown Manhattan (50th street in Hell's Kitchen), easy and convenient meal prep recipes, or anything else you thing might be helpful to a reasonably well prepared but decidedly unseasoned young person?

Assume I've read all the advice on how debt is bad, how to save for retirement (Roth vs. 401k, etc.), the necessity of an emergency fund (I'm building it), etc.  But given what I've been reading, y'all some helpful bastards, so I figured I'd be humble and show I'm open to being corrected if I am straying from the proper path.

1. MARRIAGE  
Considering marrying my girlfriend next year, probably her second semester as a student (we'd want to make sure our relationship can survive a year of us both working and a year of me working longer hours and her doing intensive education).  After that hurdle, however, it would save me nearly 10k/year in taxes.  Plus, when she turns 26 in June of 2021 (I'd likely marry her around February 2021), she'll no longer be on her parents insurance - though her parents are willing to pay her insurance while she is in school, it would be much cheaper for them if they were able to simply remunerate me for the costs of getting her insurance heavily subsidized through my work through spousal privilege.
2. JOINT HOMEOWNERSHIP  
My roommate and I both have intentions of getting, accepting and keeping the associate job following our 2 year stints, which have significant job security.  If we do move jobs, we are in an industry that is primarily concentrated in Downtown Manhattan (at least in the USA).  We are therefore reasonably certain of staying in Manhattan at least in the medium term (i.e. until having kids), with that certainty beginning in two years, and with a hefty salary bump (functionally doubling from current compensation) at that time.  
We also both ABSOLUTELY F\*\*KING DESPISE paying rent.  It's pissing thousands of dollars a month into the ether, and the idea of paying someone else's mortgage for the next 3-4 years is eating away at my soul.

* Therefore, we are strongly considering - conditional upon the receipt and acceptance of the associate offers in 2 years - jointly buying an apartment (3BR) in Downtown Manhattan, preferably in a condo that can be put on the market as a rental unit.  I have potential/probable lessor for the third bedroom, who will start in the same position we are in now in 2 years time whom would pay $1500-1600/month for three years and consider it a bargain, though he is not necessary to the purchase, just a way of ameliorating costs.  We'd be looking at home values of \~1-1.2 million, and would enter a 30 year fixed with a \~19% down payment.  Our bank offers promotional mortgage rates to employees (.25 minimum, potentially .375% off) and we would, at that time, have near top-tier credit.  
We're open to all sorts of options and shenanigans in terms of buying the home - forming a joint S Corp to buy the condo and 'rent' it to us as our primary residence, simply drafting a contract setting out joint interests in the property based upon payments into the property that will be recorded on a monthly basis with an executable buyout option given sufficient funds by one party (whomever is the primary chooser of the condo will have the option) with reasonable notice, etc.
   * \&gt;&gt; 2a) is that in any way a good idea? Why or why not?  What am I not considering?  
\&gt;&gt; 2b) if it is, what is the possibility of 'borrowing' from my 401k to fund the (likely to be quite sizable) down payment?  How much of my 401k can I borrow? What are the rules and 'interest' rates that I have to follow to pay it back?  
\&gt;&gt; 2c) advice on structuring the joint ownership agreement/where I should go to find such advice? What would be your primary concerns?  
\&gt;&gt; 2d) Is building equity at a relatively rapid pace worth this headache? (we'll have eventually minimum of 3 always, maximum of 5 full time high incomes (85-200k/annual) paying towards the mortgage around year 3 of the mortgage)  
\&gt;&gt; 2e) advice on owning rental property? Is it worthwhile to make sure it's a rental property to make sure we can move out while still owning it? (say, if both joint-interest roommate parties choose to move to other cities to raise children, but the home is already paid off and no one wants to live in it - better to just sell it, or rent it out in that case?  Seems like it would be a good idea to preserve equity value/optionality, but I don't know much about owning rental property)",finance

Bitcoin,What industries/companies would suffer badly if finite token currencies replaced fiat currencies?,"Another deflationary question I am grappling with: What industries/companies would suffer badly if finite token currencies replaced fiat currencies?

I don't see anything wrong *per se* with fiat currencies / credit, but really only the way in which they come existence. If we would simply not overprint there is nothing inherently wrong with fiat currencies and they'd be the equivalent of e.g. gold or bitcoin of which there is a finite supply, just a token really.

My issue with fiat is that the fractional reserve banking system that underpins our current fiat currencies. The fact that they come in existence as an interest bearing loan only exacerbates the issue. Because where does the money come from to pay that interest?  We're in a doom loop where credit **has to expand,** ***forever and ever*** and as such you see our Fed Reserve go through hoops to lower interest rates to keep that going. Every cycle has lead to lower tops and deeper valleys. In Europe and Japan they are already cresting under the 0 line.

When credit expansion failed in 2008 and the Fed's pimps (aka he banks) no longer were making loans the transmission channel was broken and the Fed has to bypass the banks and engage in outright money creation (really demand creation) by doing QE.

Now, if we were to go on a tokenized currency of which there is only a finite supply, the holders of those are going to think twice/thrice before spending it, and as such it will drive a lot of businesses out of existence. Basically all crud/bullshit companies who do not add any **real** value will loose out bit time.  In effect, companies who can only exist because of low interest rates I see on the chopping block. Clear winners would be the food industry, healthcare, telecom.

But what are some companies that would die on the spot? Could an Uber live? Would instagram survive? What about 

PS: Bitcoin would lead to massive massive mass layoffs with billions of people out of work

PS2: Climate change would love that: Less miles driven in fewer cars to shitty jobs. All make work and it's carbon foot print would disappear overnight.

I have a quick question re: W4 allowances’ worth (in $).

My husband’s Gross Income for 2019 is $60,000 while mine is $38,490. We are Married Filing Jointly.


&amp;nbsp;



Up until yesterday, each of our W4 was set to 1 allowance. 


&amp;nbsp;



Had we not touched it, we would have ended up paying over $10,000 in Federal Taxes this year (and have received a Refund of over $3,000 after filing next year).


&amp;nbsp;



Wanting to avoid that, we went through the IRS Withholding Calculator and were invited to update our W4s to:  **4 allowances for my husband**, and **6 allowances for me.** Doing so would bring our Refund down to $25.

We roughly have $1,833 left of Federal Taxes to pay.


&amp;nbsp;



Wanting to take advantage of a Paypal / Discover It 5% cashback (doubled at the end of the year), I am looking into **paying a portion of these $1833 as Estimated Taxes** to the IRS, through Paypal. I would however like to further adjust my/our W4 allowances so that whatever amount I pay as Estimated Taxes would not be withheld on my/our remaining 2019 paychecks.

ethereum,"How interest rates work on Compound, an automated money market and the Internet of composable risks","[Compound](https://compound.finance) is a smart contract protocol running on top of Ethereum that allows users to supply and borrow six tokens (Ether, DAI, USDC, BAT, Augur and 0) with a duration-free interest model. 

&amp;#x200B;

[*Listed to the full episode*](https://epicenter.tv/episode/295/) *–* [Read the full transcript](https://medium.com/epicenterpodcast/ep-295-compound-an-automated-money-market-for-ethereum-tokens-1511993d3444)

&amp;#x200B;

**Friederike**: So in essence there’s a supply pool and then me as a borrower, I can borrow from that supply pool and the interest rate that I am being charged is determined by what exactly?

**Robert**: It’s determined by market forces, which are enshrined in an interest rate model. So philosophically there’s really two ways that interest rates would be set. They can be set by a user specifying the terms that they’re willing to participate in which they can be set algorithmically, you know, given the complexity of developing an on chain system we actually opted for the second approach which is 

&gt;setting interest rates algorithmically and the Compound protocol uses an interest rate model to determine the interest rates at a given time. Fundamentally, it’s based on supply and demand when demand to borrow an asset is low, interest rates are low and when demand to borrow an asset is high, interest rates are high. At any given point in between, given the preferences of the individual users, you get an equilibrium interest rate. If it’s too high, people stop borrowing and it goes down. If it’s too low people are attracted to the market and it goes up.

**Friederike**: So would it be fair in your opinion to say that Compound to money markets is very much like [Uniswap](https://epicenter.tv/episode/292/) to exchanging tokens and that there’s an algorithmically governed automated market maker for the interest rate or the exchange rate and there’s not really someone who’s actually setting the rate other than that automated market maker.

Robert: That’s exactly right. Yes. It’s extremely similar to Uniswap in a lot of ways and that the system functions without an order book at all, you know, Uni swap functions without an order book for trading and Compound functions without an order book for interest rates.

**Friederike**: But does it also mean that I am never guaranteed a set interest rate neither as a lender nor as a borrower, I can only know what the current interest rate it is, but it could change either way after even a few blocks.

**Robert**: That’s exactly right. Yes. 

&gt;So that’s the one thing that you’re giving up control of when you use Compound versus a system that has duration. In some sense because there’s no duration to your participation you can't say "" I’m going to lend for 30 days or going to borrow for 30 days."" You’re basically taking the best prevailing terms every 15 seconds. And so this can fluctuate, as the markets get larger and have our supply and borrowing in them, the interest rates becomes significantly more stable, but in the short term, it is a little bit unpredictable. I think over time this will continue to improve and we’ve seen tremendous stability increases as the protocol has existed for longer amounts of time, but you’re right there is no guarantee.

[Listen to the audio on headliner](https://make.headliner.app/download/ef9bc550-6a7d-4858-b9cb-0b6b56151b21)

**Meher**: Me personally, it seems that we are almost going to this like internet of composable risks, so when I have ether I can put the ether up into Maker and get a derivative asset which is the DAI. Now, of course the DAI has some additional risk on top of Ether because now this DAI is now dependent on the Maker system, the well functioning of the Maker system. Now I have this DAI. I can put it into Compound and I can get Compound DAI out of it. But now Compound DAI is exposed to the risks inherent in Maker as well as Compound. And now maybe imagine like this future version of Truebit or some system like that where I want to let’s say run a verifier, some kind of node and I put Compound DAI as my stake in that node, and then I run that node and that node makes me some interest in an off chain system. And so when I do that I could issue the third asset which is like staked Compound DAI. So if you think of stake Compound DAI, it’s like this composite asset with three risks or four risks almost, there is a risk of Ether, risk of Maker, the risk of Compound and the risk of whatever staking solution you are using to stake Compound DAI. So you have composed four risks together you have like and you have like multiplied those four risks into an asset and you are earning in like returns and all of those four assets at the same time, but you’re also exposed to the risk of all of those four assets. So it almost feels like we are moving into this world where risks effortlessly composed together and create like synthetics that represent all of those risks as a bundle and all of those returns as a bundle. 

**Robert**: Absolutely. I mean, I think that each of these layers when composed together can either add or remove risk, right? So you’re adding the risk of each platform individually. When you create a system that you described you have the risk of Maker and there’s risk associated with Maker you have the risk of Compound and there’s risks associated with Compound. There’s the risks of Truebit and there’s you know associated ones, but they can also offset each other interesting ways where it’s possible that two layers in conjunction are actually a better asset with less risk than either them individually. A great example would be you know, if there’s a layer of this just buying insurance. It’s possible that that insurance is a waste of money and you know the event never occurs, but by combining it with Compound, there’s income that offsets the cost of insurance and it’s possible to the net product of those two layers is less risk and more upside. And I think all of this is in just such an early chapter that we’re going to see, you know, a thousand new experiments proposing different layers together and experimenting with the use case to come up with systems that are fundamentally creating value. And that’s going to be really exciting to watch.

personalfinance,"Need help with taxes (US) - My wife is self-employed, how can we better prepare for next years tax payment?","Hello r/personalfinance \- throwaway account as there are some personal details I would rather not have on my main.

TLDR - wife is self-employed, i'm not. We have a kid now. How do we get out of the hole in taxes so we aren't paying more in fees &amp; interest?

My wife and I were married last year and boy oh boy was I not prepared for the tax impact. She is self-employed (hair stylist), most of her income comes via cash/check and she is able to deduct a lot of expenses - product, some travel, booth rent, etc. But she has never paid into federal tax during the year, rather opting to pay out the year after in payment plans. Little did I know that if you do this, the IRS tacks on interest. I hate paying interest.

I have always worked for an employer so this is new territory for me. I have adjusted my W-4 from time to time, decreasing the withholding towards the end of the year to get my tax filing as close to $0 as possible - although I skipped out on doing that last year because of the unknowns of being newly married.

For year 2018 we ended up going the married, filing separate route - her accountant ran the numbers and it was slightly cheaper this way. Still out of pocket \~$6,000 on her end - so we are paying $500 per month this year plus interest fees.

Anyone out there in a similar situation have advice? Do we just start paying in quarterly estimates on top of the 2018 payment plan? Do we save separately and try and pay out in a large chunk next year? Do we need to think about setting up an LLC for her?

More details:

* Job 1 (employer) - $82,000
* Job 2 (self-employed) - $40,000
   * deductions - \~$10,000
* 1 Child
* No other source of income, negligible interest income

personalfinance,Need input on Construction-to Permanent Loan . I'm not money smart and I feel like I am in over my head.,"My husband and I are having a house built in the nest two months or so. We had a house three years ago but moved and have been renting ever since.

&amp;#x200B;

My in-laws are family sub diving part of their land. We are looking at around a little over an acre of land. No survey or appraisal has been done yet because we are still waiting for a soil test to be done. I have seen similar land in the area goe for about $8-10k. The land is paid off and there is currently no lien on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Our builder has given us a building proposal and it's about $155k including septic, some grading and connecting to county water. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are planning to ask for $160k from the bank for a construction loan-to permanent loan. I worry because that really is not enough leeway for any unexpected costs but my husband thinks we can make it work and the builder says he was generous in his estimates. Will be putting down 20% and using the land as collateral (I think that's the word I need to use) because from what I have been reading banks like 25%-30% down on construction loans. My credit score is considered great and his is good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our gross income is only about $70k. I get bonuses occasionally but usually nothing of significance.  Only debt we have currently is a $400 car payment. We are living with the in-laws so that is helping us save some money from not having to pay rent (we are contributing some money to them, around $200) 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of my questions

* Is there anything else I need to think about before I start looking for a loan? 
* Is there anyway to save money on closing costs because that's one of my biggest worries? A lot of money is already being put into down payment. We MIGHT roll it into our loan which I know hurts us in the long run. Or maybe use less points on the closing costs and have a higher interest rate. Interest rates are really great now but of course that could change while the house is being built. 
* Because of where we live and how much we make we could qualify for a USDA loan but I am not sure if that's really a good option because it seems it's best for people who can't put a substantial down payment down?",finance
personalfinance,Could this balance transfer be a good idea?,"Looking to transfer balances to help pay off debt. We've paid down a lot of debt but still have 2 cards that need to be paid off.

Card 1: Wells Fargo CC. I've had it since I turned 18, so shitty terms. paid if off years ago and just recently had to charge 2k on it due to very unforeseen circumstances back in December and January. Interest rate is 24 percent. So of course I'm kicking myself now. Card is in my name.

Card 2: Discover Cash Back Card. In my husbands name. Balance of 3600 dollars. I can't find the interest rate but the mininum payment is 83 dollars a month and they charge 60 something a month interest. so it's fucking high.

Looking at a USAA CC to do a balance transfer. We do mostly everything through USAA anyways, so it'd make it easier. Terms of the card: (Copied from their site so sorry about the text changes)

**$200 statement credit** after $500 in Qualifying Purchases made by 10/31/2019.

* **0% Introductory APR until 12/01/2020** on all purchases, balance transfers and convenience checks. After that, you will receive a variable Regular APR of **15.15%**. There is a **3%** fee for each balance transfer and convenience check.See note2
* **No annual fee.** No penalty APR. No foreign transaction fees.

We would obviously aim to pay it off before the 0% period ends, and the interest rate is much lower anyways.

Bitcoin,Decentralized Derivatives,"I'll preface this first off as usual with admonishment towards people who dislike derivatives. Derivatives are not inherently bad, they are in fact necessary, to think otherwise is financial ignorance. Comingling, rehypothecation, and accounting fraud are bad, and it can be prevented with the blockchain. Don't push bad investing and trading skills onto a market that needs infrastructure.

&amp;#x200B;

The big issue is that there will be continued abuses by states and governments attempting to censor and commit fraud and otherwise political and financial repression and unequal laws against the poor by centralizing the derivative market. It is how predatory finance capitalism in America is largely able to control people (the world). Because it is centralized.

&amp;#x200B;

Next you have platforms like Kraken that do offer some margin capabilities, but you have extreme counter party risk. Kraken can take your money based off of any stupid pretense, and you are trading against them instead of peer to peer like bitmex. You don't own your keys.

&amp;#x200B;

The direction that layer 2 solutions are going in, combined with federated side chains and innovations on top of binance's new chain such as with Thorchain are a much more sensible outcome in the long run. I'll try to explain a few of these technologies

A) Thorchain is probably the most promising since it rewards liquidity nodes on the network and plans to integrate multiple chains and lightning network while using binance chain to jump start the initial dex offering. 

b) Tradelayer is a layer 2 solution from the omni layer developer that can be adapted to meet regulations and KYC if absolutely necessary, but allows for non KYC liquidity nodes, and being layer 2 means its definitely proposed to interact with lightning network. It functions similarly to lightning, performing the computation needed for margining and settlement similarly to the many exchanges offchain with lightning. 

c) RSK bitcoin smart contracts which will basically enhance anything operating a DEX with liquidity nodes and the need for complex smart contracts. 

d) Virtual machines with Ren VM that can process smart contracts and link together liquidity provider

&amp;#x200B;

Those are just a few. But with Ren and Liquid swap, they are still largely proprietary and deliberately facilitating corporate clients. This is what bitcoin needs to move away from. We need open source solutions that will perform liquid swaps functions for the masses, for retail.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Best way to invest small increments after monthly budget/spending?,"Quick background: 26 yo, single, corporate job with regular bi-weekly payments and annual bonuses. 

After bills, spending, etc. I’m usually left with $300-700/month that I’ve typically moved to savings, however I now have $10k built up and should be putting this money to better use.

Current debts are student loans ($21k, 4.4% weighted avg) and car note ($16k, 4.69%).

I am making contributions to 401k and RIRA, but am not maxing these out. 

Based on my interest rates, I believe the logical  first step would be to increase my contributions. I’ve put this off so far because if I make any big purchases in the month then this excess income is quickly nullified. Having the extra funds around gives me a better peace of mind financially.

My short term financial goal is to buy a house, aiming for end of 2021 so let’s say 30 months. I would like to do so with a sizeable down payment, preferably without having to withdraw from my 401k. I am aiming for $40-50k which I believe is achievable with my annual bonuses and proper investments.

So what should I be doing with this extra $300-700/mo? Should I increase my 401k contribution by $150-200/pay cycle and borrow from it when it’s house buying time? Should I invest the monthly excess using E-trade, ML or Robinhood? Pay down debt?

I would like to keep $6k as an emergency fund which gives me $4k to play with now. I know I should be throwing extra money at my debts to pay them off, but I think it’s a small sacrifice of long term wealth to help meet short term goals.",finance

personalfinance,"Looking fo advice for my debt situation. Went from zero debt to $30,000 on credit cards in 12 months,","Hey PF, I'm early 30s, Married, In Tennessee. 

TL/DR - Should I pay some cards off with a HELOC?

So, Over the last 12 months, my life has got so much more meaning, but on the flip side it has also become financially wrecked and I could really use some advice. 

12 months ago I had zero debt (Except for mortgage) was making $7,000/mo and my wife was brining in $3,000/mo. $12,000 in savings. Our house is worth around $240k and we owe $140,000 on it. My wife has $100,000 of student debt, which we started paying down a bunch when we got married and now it's at $80k. We found out we were pregnant with our first child. We were overjoyed. 

Then, a series of events took place where things have spiraled out of control Financially. First, my car died. I got a used truck which has been great since for $14,000. A truck because I've done and am doing renovations, and I'm on quite a bit of land (the renovations are going to be on hold now). I took out a loan to get it as my credit union gave me a 2% APR and my family was pulling over 100k annually, so I thought why not? I can splash a bit. Then, My air conditioner died. Damn. $7,000. Got it at 5 years interest free. Then somehow our house got bed bugs. Damn. $2000. Then I got a $6,000 Dental bill. Damn. Things at this point started to get a bit concerning. I started to cut wherever I could. Then, I found out that the same day as my first child was due to be born, I would be losing my job. BIG DAMN. Then, the best day of my life came, and my child was born, sadly there were complications with both the child and my wife a couple months into being parents. Thankfully they're both fully healthy now, but unfortunately almost all the pre-birth medical costs were in 2018, and all the complication bills were in 2019. So that meant I had to pay up to my deductible twice in a very short space of time. $10,000. Damn again. I then had a close family member die in my home country so I had a week off of my handyman earning to fly back there, also had to spend about 2k on the trip. 

We were Pulling $10k/mo so I had started to load up my credit cards with bills using 0%/15 month APR cards to give us time to pay them off but then I lost my job and I've now been unemployed for 7 months. Brutal.  

So, I find myself $30,000 in credit card debt. Some of that is my fault as I had a month of terrible mental health about 3 months into being jobless. I was irresponsible with about $1200. Feel like a fool about that. 

I've been working handyman jobs pulling about $2500/mo. So we're at about $5500/mo income with $4600/mo of regular expenses including minimum debt servicing. That leaves about $900/mo for extra debt payments but that means in 9-12 months when my cards are no longer 0% I'll only have paid around $10k leaving me with $20k at shitty credit card interest rates. Obviously if I get employment close to my old $7k/mo level I'll be fine, but after 6 months, I'm having some doubts. 

Wondering if I should take out a 20k HELOC at 4.1%? We'd be leveraging 8% of the house, which is about 14% of our equity in it. 

For over a decade I've been a proud no-debt, Dave Ramsey-esque financially frugal person. Now I feel like a failure under a mountain of debt. 

Any advice would be nice.",finance

I am interested in learning more about Grover's algorithm, so I have some questions for you folks:

1) Is the algorithm theoretical or do we know for absolute fact it will work once quantum computers exist?

2) It seems from the above linked PDF that the key schedule makes up most of the gate count and complexity of the circuit. If we modified the key schedule of AES from it's current implementation to a new more-complicated implementation (*explained below) would it then be rendered immune to quantum-attack? Basically my question is: Would a complicated but practical key schedule render a quantum attack useless by requiring an absurd amount of quantum gates?

*Class 2C key schedule: 256-bit key is fed into SHA2-512, which is then fed into Blake2b, which is fed into bcrypt, which is fed into a Argon2 (1GB memory) to form a stream of N-bits where N is the required length of the AES-256 key schedule.

personalfinance,Should we buy a house?,"My husband and I are in our mid 20s. We currently rent.  Our debt is from a car ($15,000 roughly) his student loans ($5,000) my student loans ($21,000- they are in my name but my parents are paying them off) and... here is the painful part, $10,00 of credit card debt from not being smart about spending during a service year after college.  My husband makes about $71,000 a year. I am getting my master’s in speech pathology in state which means I will eventually need to take out 10-20k more in debt, but for now I am using an education grant from my service year.  

We recently moved to a lower cost of living area (Albuquerque) and I have been aggressively saving and paying off the credit cards (all other debt in on a payment plan) while budgeting.  We have $3000 in savings, and the renewal on our lease is coming in September.  My husband has looked into programs that can help with a down payment, and says it is doable this year.  I am hearing advice that you shouldn’t buy a house with large amounts of debt.  I have no doubt that we could pay off our mortgage month to month. Our current rent is 1239 plus pet rent, and it seem pretty simple to get a small place in this area with a lower monthly payment than that.

2. If I was able to get a subsidized loan, could I pay it off right when I finish school(or during the 6-month grace period)? Essentially paying no interest. Or is that not how subsidized loans work?

personalfinance,"Graduating This Spring, 100k in Student Loans","This upcoming May I will be graduating from my university. All in all, I will have about 100k in loans. Here is about how they break down:

&amp;#x200B;

Loan A: \~$83,000 in private student loan debt at  \~7.60% interest. It is currently accruing interest.

Loan B: \~$20,000 in federal loans, at 4.49% interest. About half of this is accruing interest. The other half is not until I graduate and begin making payments.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, ultimately, I wish I could have cut a good portion of these loans out, however, my father unfortunately gave me some fairly bad advice from the start, such as urging me to get private loans and ignore federal loans, which I later learned was a mistake, among a multitude of other things. Also, my university absolutely screwed me out of a specific scholarship which would have overall saved me about \~30k, of which I am currently fighting a major battle to receive, however, I want to assume worst case scenario that I will not be getting this scholarship.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have very good credit, 770+, so refinancing Loan A at a lower rate (Optimally, I can get a rate as low as \~3.2%) and longer term and making fairly lower payments in favor of my other accounts that would grow faster, such as a 401k, seems like the way to go. For Loan B, looking into relief programs and such seems like a possibility once I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

I am graduating with two bachelors degrees, one in Finance, one in Real Estate. Looking at all my peers and recent grads, it is reasonable to expect I will be making between 50-60k out of college in my area. I plan to live fairly frugally, it would be reasonable to expect to spend around \~$600/month on rent if I split with my girlfriend. Here is another big caveat, I have $25,000 currently sitting in a high yield savings account. This money was from back child support that was owed to me when I was younger, and was court ordered. I have not spent any of it, and did not want to touch it until after I finish school in order to give myself some financial breathing room later on. Most of my family that was able to help me financially has passed on or is otherwise not in the picture, so I do not have anyone to really rely on. Once I graduate I am on my own.

Me and partner have a 401K we want to withdraw , it's not a very big amount (6K) and partner isn't able to contribute to it since earlier this year. 

Our plans are to use this money (2.5K) to finish our emergency fund and remainder for fixed expenses to give us (with remainder + already saved money for fixed expenses) we are able to get ahead 3-4 months on fixed expenses while we would be able to aggressively save more for our goals.

Our plans are to leave the U.S. and start a business in an emerging country not too far away. So I told her it doesn't make sense for us to keep this small bit in this account and withdraw it in 40YRs because she isn't able to contribute nor is it useful rolling over into a different plan as we don't want to put our investments in the U.S. economy. 

The problem is through Fidelity it says federal estimation is 20% , does that cover the penalty and the state income tax as well?? Should we withdraw it now and pay the penalty or should we just wait till she's at retirement age. I'm leaning towards withdraw now because it'll be more useful than a meager amount in 40YRs. She doesn't plan on working in the states or living here long term and we both share similar goals of opening up somewhere more affordable. Lost here and looking for advice on the proper decision to make and all help would be appreciated.

My parents said they will pay for college but taking the loans will help. They also never let me have a high school part tine job so I could focus on my education. They'll let me have a job in college once I get used to my schedule but freshmen aren't allowed to have work studies.

I'm going to college for animation and I understand what skill level I have and with networking I know I could get a good job. During college I was thinking of starting a webcomic on Webtoons in order to bring in even a little cash if it takes off.

I just wanted to know what else I could do make cash to save for the future. I know planning 4 years in advance sounds stupid but I don't like the idea of moving lower than middle class.

Also most good jobs for the animation industry are in California so I know I'll have to save a lot.

I don't know any way to make money besides a job, Webtoons, stocks, or bonds. The latter of which won't be of much use in only 4 years.

My parents told me not to worry about money yet but that's not worrying is not my natural mindset. What can I do?

personalfinance,Is it worth delaying a few loan payments in order to maximize the student loan interest deduction?,"I started paying back my federal student loans in earnest earlier this year. They had accrued a total of almost $4000 in interest, most of that by the loan with the highest interest rate of 6.8%. I'm enrolled in an income-based repayment plan and at my current income, I am required to pay $5 per month on each loan, but I have been able to pay at least $300 each month so far, with everything except the minimum payments going to the high interest loan. When planning things out, I noticed that at my current rate of repayment, I will pay about $3500 by the end of the year, 100% of which will go towards interest. That will exceed the maximum deduction of $2500 per return. 

Is it worth it to hold back a few payments (except the minimum $5, of course) until the New Year in order to be able to deduct as much as possible on my 2020 return? I'm self-employed, so even though my current income is low, my marginal tax rate is quite high. If I'm understanding the deduction correctly, moving $1000 in interest repayment to next year could save me between $200 and $300.",finance
personalfinance,Wondering if this idea for repaying student loans is smart and/or worthwhile,"So first the situation. I have about $54,000 left in Federal student loans (was a little over 60k this past October). I am currently paying around 1400 a month in payments (including a bit from employer). My minimum is about 650. So repayment is going well. By my calculations I should have them paid in about 3.5 years now, not including bonuses and raises between now and then. I make about 70k before taxes, and maybe another 5 or 6k in bonuses (variable). 


So the way I am currently paying is anything past the minimum is going to the highest interest loan. Currently it's all split among about 10 loans, with rates ranging from 3.4% to 6.8%. 

My idea is, get the minimum repayment plan. I see that I can get one as low as about 220 a month. This is the extended graduated plan. This means that the other ~$1200 can go towards the highest interest loan (as opposed to only about 750 right now). I'm fairly certain this plan is generated by the minimum at the start being nearly interest only, and increasing the minimum over time.


Basically, I'm wondering if I'm missing something. To me it seems this would let me shift a larger portion of my payment to the higher interest loans and save on interest over time. I guess it feels weird that no one mentions this, and I can find nothing online about this strategy. So I'm not sure if it's just not worthwhile, or if there's something I'm missing.

The debate over representation on the Bank's notes could resurface after this decision.

Jane Austen will continue to be the only woman, apart from the Queen, whose image will be seen on the four notes.

There was also a campaign calling for a historic figure from a black and ethnic minority background (BAME) to feature on the new £50 note.

In response to Maidstone MP Helen Grant, who raised the issue in Parliament, the governor said: ""The Bank will properly consider all protected characteristics, and seek to represent on its banknotes characters reflecting the diversity of British society, its culture and its values.""

## How will the banknote change?

Steam engine pioneers James Watt and Matthew Boulton appear on the current £50 note, issued in 2011.

The new £50 Turing note will enter circulation by the end of 2021, Mr Carney announced at the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester. It will feature:

* A photo of Turing taken in 1951 by Elliott and Fry, and part of the National Portrait Gallery's collection
* A table and mathematical formulae from Turing's 1936 paper ""On Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem"" - foundational for computer science
* The Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) Pilot Machine - the trial model of Turing's design and one of the first electronic stored-program digital computers
* Technical drawings for the British Bombe, the machine specified by Turing and one of the primary tools used to break Enigma-enciphered messages
* A quote from Alan Turing, given in an interview to The Times newspaper on 11 June 1949: ""This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be""
* His signature from the visitor's book at Bletchley Park in 1947
* Ticker tape depicting Alan Turing's birth date (23 June 1912) in binary code. The concept of a machine fed by binary tape featured in Turing's 1936 paper.

gaming,Minecraft’s Lore? [Theory],"I believe I have a theory that I think solves the minecraft lore, more specifically, what happened before you start your adventure. There are certain things that I might not be 100% sure how to explain but I would love your help with those. Fingers crossed this doesn’t get lost in new haha. Anyways, let’s start with the fact that I believe Minecraft takes place after an apocalypse. I don’t think the entire Minecraft world takes place in the aftermath of this tragedy but I’m sure that the land we build on is. I believe that the player character, Steve, comes from the area that avoided this apocalypse. I think he’s a castaway who landed in the apocalyptic land. The reasons I think he’s a castaway is because of how he looks dirty and his clothes are tattered and ripped. But the central focus of this theory isn’t about the current day Minecraft world, but rather in the world before. I very strongly believe that hundreds or maybe even thousands of years ago, there existed an advanced civilization which built things (such as monuments, cities, temples and many other things), tamed and civilized the wild land, cultivated plants and animals, made music (using the disks and noteblocks), had an economy and had jobs. During this time I believe there was also a plague which turned people into zombies, similar to what the villagers have, and all the zombies are simply the people of the old world who succumbed to the plague. Eventually, this society got too big of a head and wanted more. When they created a portal which led to a new dimension (The End), many people protested which led the creators of this portal to create a massive stronghold around them to defend them from protestors. The civilians and soldiers went through to the dimension in order to try and defeat the dragon, but sadly, they failed. The dragon transformed these people into horrid disfigured creatures which we call endermen. Some of these endermen managed to escape back to the overworld, but ultimately, it was in vain as they were still doomed to be trapped in their awful bodies, forced to desperately try and pick up and place blocks to try and be the normal people they once were. I think the remaining people who hadn’t transformed were quickly slaughtered by the endermen (most likely because they stared at them because let’s be honest if your neighbors turned into monsters you’d probably stare at the too). The ones who weren’t killed off were most likely killed off by time. Eventually, you just won’t be able to breed anymore. The endermen are friendly and desperately try and communicate with Steve with garbled “hi’s” and “what’s up’s”. They become enraged when you look at them because they hate what they have become and doesn’t want people looking at them. Eventually, their civilization fades away and is engulfed by nature. The ocean water level rises and swallows their cities and monuments, their temples are engulfed by jungle plants and trees and sand. Their mine shafts, left dormant for centuries are occupied by monsters. Sometime after the apocalypse and before the arrival of Steve, a new civilization rose from the ashes. They took the lands and desperately created settlements to hide and survive in this apocalyptic world they called home. The villagers. Over time, these villagers have made advancements to their society and 1.14 has showed the most recent and arguably most positive advancement. Now once again, sometime after the apocalypse and before the arrival of Steve, another character arrived in the lands. It is unknown if he was a castaway or a descendant of the people of the former civilization but he had the same mission as Steve, to defeat the Enderdragon. Ingame, we can see that he had nearly completed his quest by placing the eyes of ender in the portal. But alas, the portal is left unfinished and abandoned, showing that this person was most likely killed. The next event to happen is the arrival of Steve and we all know how that goes. Steve defeats the Dragon and avenges the former civilization and conquers the world once more.

Extra: 1. I believe many mobs such as pigs, cows, sheep, chickens, squids, fish, creepers, spiders, slimes, polar bears, pandas, cats, wolves, ocelots and others all existed before the apocalypse. 2. There’s a chance that somehow Steve and his people have built an immunity to the zombie virus 3. Woodland manors, pillager camps and witch huts were all built post-apocalypse by the Vindicators, Pillagers and witches. 4. Music disk eleven is most likely the final moments of a man during the apocalypse who is being chased by an enderman because he looked at him. The man most likely ran to a cave to escape the enderman. Once in the cave he looks through his inventory, tries to light flint and steel, is discovered by the enderman, desperately tries to dig out and his finally killed by the enderman. 5. Emeralds were most likely the main form of currency pre-apocalypse in the civilization being that its unable to make tools and armour like the other ores and its significantly more rare than all the other ores. 6. The hustle and bustle of this civilization most likely made the mobs that existed at the time (Creepers, spiders, zombies, maybe skeletons) seek refuge in caves. After the civilization became quiet, many mobs left the caves, but many stayed 

Holes in my theory (help would be appreciated): 1. How skeletons were created and why do they only wield bows. 2. How did they activate the portal if their were no endermen yet? Eyes of ender could simply be an alternative to the original resource used but if that’s the case what was the other resource that’s capable of activating an End Portal? 4. If the ocean monuments were built by humans, where did the guardians live pre-apocalypse? 5. Did they explore the Nether pre-apocalypse? 6. How did Endermen get to the Nether? 7. Did the villagers live alongside the pre-apocalypse society or did they exist later.

Mnuchin's speech leaves me with mixed thoughts.

There should be little to no dispute about what the original bitcoin whitepaper entailed when it was written and published in November 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto intended to create a financial system that is free from the effects of the federal reserve.

Did he foresee taxation? Possible Embracement from the United States' government? How about acknowledgement from the President? How about the events that we see unfolding in Washington?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

business,Common Situation and Solution of international shipping,"Hi, this is Song Fei from TrackingMore.com. From today I’m gonna write a  series of articles about international shipping. And today I want to discuss with you about all the situation which a seller ma be face when the package has been shipped.

### A. Domestics Issues.

#### 1.  The typical damage or loss of goods in transit may be cause by the below reason:

(1) To pursue better profits, some couriers prefers to choose remote shipping agency, which takes a long time from a remote agency to courier.

(2) Long logistics lines. For some long distance cities, vehicle bumps and transhipment collision are typical situations, which will lead to less of goods or damage of goods.

(3) Individual freight forwarders withhold high-value assets, such as computers, phone, etc. This is a rare phenomenon, which is not common but does occur in the usual logistics.

(4) Products damaged due to violent sorting or unregulated operation by logistics operators.

#### 2. Three main issues may happen in National Customs inspection:

(1) Counterfeit products. All countries are firmly cracking down on counterfeit products, so Customs inspection is always strict on counterfeit products.

(2) Products prohibited by Customs for exporting. Such as batteries, powder, liquids, precious metal and other prohibited products

(3) Try to escape from Customs clearance. For some products which need commodity inspection, a lot seller will hide them in other products and claim other names. Once this behaviour was found by the Customs, the goods will be refunded, and a huge fine is on the way. Therefore, sellers should strictly follow the laws, export products under accordance with the Customs regulations, and figure out the need for export list materials, such as commodity inspection certificates, customs declaration documents and so on.

### B. International Risk.

#### 1 Failed on aviation security inspection.

We all know that products which are harmful to freight interference signals,  flammable and explosive products, and fake brand products can’t pass through the inspection.  Therefore, if there are dangerous goods in the goods transported by the merchant,  the certificate of the dangerous goods shall be provided to airlines. If there are any battery products, the MSDS shall be prepared; and sell fake brand products.

#### 2. Risk In Transit.

It is easy to have a lot of problems in this process when the air parcel passes through a lot of transit when it reaches the destination country. The loss during the international logistics transit process, the delay of package delivery caused by bad weather, the violence sorting of the sorting employees, and the breakage of the outer package caused by the transfer and unpacking, are more likely to occur in transit. If a merchant wants to ship fragile products, an easy-to-be-broken label must stick to the package, and choose foam, the bubble bag, the wooden frame or the wooden case accordingly. Strengthen the product of the goods and ensure product safety before shipping. For high-value products, the merchant is advised to purchase the insurance; For high-speed-demand goods, the merchant should carefully choose logistics methods and avoiding post shipping.

#### 3. Custom Claims Issue.

Common Custom claims are:

(1) Buyers are unwilling to clear customs due to the high tariff. This is usually happening in Brazil clients.

(2) The products are under restrictive import category of buyer’s country.

(3) Infringing products are seized by customs.

(4) The declared value doesn’t accordance with the actual situation.

### C. Solutions for international shipping

Knowing the potential risk, we can prepare accordingly. In order to avoid these problems, companies should understand the customs clearance requirements of the products in the destination country,  and try to prevent legal risk.

1) As far as possible truthfully declare the value of the products.

 If the guests strongly request low declaration, keep your evidence. The name of the claimed product should be as detailed as possible and avoid writing only “gift” and “accessories”.

2) Commercial express to Brazil must provide the recipient’s VAT tax number.

3)Electronic products mailed to Europe, especially Italy and Spain regularly needs CE.

4)The package cannot be abandon or destroy in these eight countries: Spain, Portugal, Poland, Ukraine, Italy, Russia, Brazil, and Israel.

### D. Choose suitable logistics.

For high-speed demand products,  commercial express is a better choice. The express fee is indeed higher, but it can be tracked all the time, 5-7 days to delivery, and low risk of loss.

For normal demand products, air packet is a better balance. Air packet accept parcel under 2 kgs. Cheap, convenient, global post-mail, unified price, but the speed is not stable, the update of shipping information is slow, and high packet loss risk.

The logistics are different in different countries, particular claims are different.

1) In western Europe, Northern Europe, and southern Europe, DHL and TNT both have reliable customs clearance. TNT has an obvious advantage in the Netherlands and Belgium.

2) In Eastern Europe, the DHL advantage area is Lumaya, Bulgaria, Moldova, Hungary, etc., and the EMS advantage area is Greece, Russia, Turkey and so on.

3) In Asia, FedEx and DHL are recommended in Korea, Japanese, Thailand and east-south Asia. In Indonesia, DHL is highly suggested for custom claims.

4) In Canada and America, FedEx, UPS and DHL are recommended.

5) In Mexico, FedEx is recommended.

6) In Argentina, Brazil, EMS is recommended.

7) In Central and South America, FedEx has an advantage on price, but to be careful of customs clearance risk.

8) In Oceanica, DHL and UPS are fast, but the price is high; TNT and FedEx offer a lower price, but lack of business network.

9) The Middle East region is suitable for choosing Middle East Express ARAMEX and EMS.

10) Commercial courier in Africa is very expensive and too many remote areas.

personalfinance,Help in understanding Student Loans,"Hello /r/personalfinance! Long time listener, first time caller. My wife and I are in the process of setting up our budget for the next few years and I have a few questions about her student loans. Like many people her age, my wife took out some extremely predetory loans to pay for her college. We have been paying minimums on these loans for about 8 years now. After looking them over last night, I am seeing that her interest due on the loans is now almost gone leaving us with the principal balance on the loans. We were planning on throwing more money at them as our income has increased, but now I am wondering if it is even worth it as, from the way I am seeing it, we are over the hump in loan and any extra we pay to principal doesn't matter as the bank already got their interest money. I am correct in this assumption? I am pretty sure that these were variable interest rate loans and the rate has gone up over time but does this even matter now that most of our payments are going to principal? Any insight would be much appreciated. Thanks for your time.",finance
technology,Cryptocracy: A Discussion of how Crypto Could Affect Governance,"Forget the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies and bear with me through a brainstorm on what we could do with blockchain tech in governance.

Imagine an application you could run on your home computer or at a public library or internet cafe, we'll just call it the terminal.

It's similar to a web browser or social media platform. You log in, and access your preferences, records, communications, and transactions.

However, it's a decentralized blockchain app used to aggregate citizen data, facilitate productive social contracts, and even legislate local, state, and federal policy.

Let's start with the preferences menu.

Here, you specify several options. Some examples:

&gt;I support ______ to represent me on the city council.

&gt;I support ______ to represent me in congress.

&gt;I think people in my town should pay __ percentage of their income as tax.

&gt;__% of that tax should go to education.

&gt;__% of that tax should go to the police.

&gt;I think proposition &lt;link to citizen-proposed bill submitted in forums&gt; should become law.

These settings could be polled in real time, creating a public, accurate, up-to-date database of what we'll call a kind of dynamic 'voting.'

This data could be used to instantly tap into the will of the people, where ideas proposed by anyone could garner support on the forums and be forced to a vote on whether they become law.

Terminal ID fraud would be difficult as all of these preferences would be tied to a cryptographic identity with a public transactional history that could be audited and verified. Security would be a major consideration, of course. Multifactor auth would be needed, perhaps biometrics, passwords, facial recognition, and/or other factors.

My education, work, medical, criminal and other history would remain private unless specified public and could be verified by issuing signing requests to both parties.

Examples:

&gt;I want to work at company A.

&gt;Company A issues a request to both my ID and a previous employer/school ID.

&gt;Our IDs respond with a signed transaction hash saying 'I have degree X' or 'I worked at company B for five years.' Hashes are compared, verified, and trust is established.

&gt;I go to doctor A.

&gt;Signing requests issued to me, previous doctor, or insurance company, etc.

&gt;Relevant, approved portions of my medical transaction history are supplied to my new doctor. No paperwork. Accurate, verifiable data is provided quickly.

Social programs could be transformed.

Examples:

&gt;I wish to make $______ of my spare cash available as a hardship loan at the interest rate of ___ to be issued to an individual with no more than ___ failed-to-repay statuses in their loan history to be repaid by date ______.

&gt;I would like to mentor a citizen with failed-to-repay statuses to help them get back on their feet.

&gt;I am offering $______ to anyone who can mentor a person with over __ failed-to-repay statuses to be delivered after two years of a clean record by the mentoree.

You can possibly imagine where this could go. We invest in each other through the use of this terminal to create incentives to foster growth and acceptable behavior.

How about an insurance group?

&gt;I agree to put $___ into insurance fund group ______ each month, where members can request withdrawal claims subject to the community's review.

&gt;I agree that each claim review I participate in credits $__ on my behalf to the fund if I cast my withdrawal/deny vote with the majority.

Again, a brainstorm here, but you can see how it may be possible to create incentives for performing duties like claim administration.

The overall goal of this system would be to amplify, empower, serve, and protect the will of the people and to create a system of trust, transparency, and efficiency that works to consistently improve the community.

When people violate laws, depending on the crimes, they could be offered opportunities for redemption by agreeing to be coached by someone who is again, rewarded by the community for successful results.

Kid gets into a lot of fights? Let's say you used to as well, but found a way to manage your temper. Get paid to help the kid learn your tricks. Get paid again if he gets a job or helps another kid stop fighting later.

Drug addict? Same stories. Use the public blockchain data in the terminal to match people with the right skills to the places they are needed.

Job interviews? Resumes? Certifications? All available instantly. No HR paperwork nightmares, just a contractual transaction on the chain.

What about these more controversial incentives for anti-drug or anti-gay communities:

&gt;I am willing to pay $____ to assist in moving individuals with ______ characteristic to a town where that is legal and accepted.

Or:

&gt;I am willing to pay $____ to assist in moving individuals who want to pay higher/lower taxes into education to a town where they match.

Or the opposite:

&gt;I want to relocate to a town who values ______, and am open to offers of assistance.

I'll stop for now, but I wanted to pose some questions to the community here.

What other uses of this imagined decentralized governance application come to your mind?

What are the serious dangers or challenges you see in the adoption of this or similar technologies to the governance space?

Do you think this kind of technologizing governance would be a net positive, do you forsee disaster?",technology
personalfinance,"Opinions on refinance, potentially cash-out, for lower interest rate","We bought our home last winter at 5.25% interest (30 year fixed) for $280k. We now owe $233k and pay $1520/month. 

We are looking into a $10k cashout refinance to buy a small portion of land adjacent to our lot. Because the local real estate market is really hot right now, our mortgage guy (we approached him about this) thought we could get the house appraised at $315k to get $10k cashout for a loan amount of ~$250k with a monthly payment of $1490. That seems almost too good to be true to get $10k back and still pay less per month. I know we’d owe more on the loan but it is still less than the value of the house and we wouldn’t need PMI. Am I missing something here? I’ve been reading up on old posts on cashout refinances and it seems like usually the monthly payment goes up.

Either way, we were considering refinancing to get the better interest rates right now. If we don’t do the $10k cashout, we could lower our payment to $1370/month and increase the loan amount a few thousand to cover closing costs. At that point I guess we could look into a HELOC to get the money for the land? I’m not sure what would be a better deal. 

I feel like it has been tough to wrap my head around all this and I welcome any suggestions for learning more about refinancing.",finance

personalfinance,"My(M32) father (M60) took a lot of loans under my name, and now is unable to pay them. I am now drowning in debt with no way out. Advise needed.","TL:DR: I'm massively debt ridden and see no way out.

Sorry if this is a little long. My situation is a little complicated and I am suffering from massive depression due to this, unable able to move ahead in my life, unable to sustain relationships.

Since as long back (since I was 6) as I can remember, my father has always been under debt pressure. He has always been running from bank to bank to secure loans. Many times he has not been able to pay his monthly instalments. He was actually very wealthy and had a great business but multiple divorces (he's married 4 times) always screwed him financially. Plus his lavish lifestyle. Later, when he couldn't borrow more because of his defaulting credit score, he changed his name to start fresh with the banks. 

After I graduated, I got a good job and started making decent money. I used to always give atleast 70% of my salary to him, sometimes all of it, because I knew he needed it. I stayed at his house and we eat together, so I thought of it as paying my ""living expenses"". It is in my nature to not spend beyond my means I've always lived on a shoestring. I hardly shop, hardly eat out. After 3 years of working, paying healthy taxes, never crossing my credit card limits and always paying my credit card bills on time, my father figured that I would have a very good score. And indeed, I had a very healthy score. So, he took huge amounts of loans under my name. I quit my job (I've always been entrepreneurial and the 9-5 wasn't for me) and started working in his business. He convinced me into it. He opened a new a company of which I was the Proprietor and he took a business loan for it. Similarly, he has opened companies under my sister's and my grandmother's names, just so that he could secure more loans. 

He couldn't pay his dues back so he took cash loans on very high interest rates from loan sharks. One big loan he secured after handing over the papers of our house. Here is a summary of our loans and monthly instalments:

* The biggest one is a loan of $250,000 we took by giving our house as security. Our house is worth around $750,000. We have to pay the bank $4,000 every month, for the next 50 years. We have paid back till now $50,000 of the principal amount. We have been paying since 2 years, but last month and this month we were not able to pay. We cannot pay them next month too. The house is under the name of my grandfather and my father. I am the legal heir to it.
* Car loans: We own 3 cars. We have paid off all the payments for 1 car. The other 2 cars we have to pay $150 and $500 a month for the next 2 years.
* Another business loan: we have to pay $500 every month for the next 3 years.
* In business, we have debtors of around $60,000.
* We have monthly expenses (electricity, utilities, food, office space rent) of $3,500.
* From loan sharks, we have to pay them weekly. In a month, we pay them a around $3500. Only 3 month of payments are left.
* My credit card is maxed out at $2500. My dad has 2 credit cards, each maxed out at $1500.
* In back taxes, we owe around $15,000.

Because of no working capital, our business is suffering and we are only making around $4000 a month. If we had working capital, we can easily make $500 a day, which means $12,000 - $15,000 a month. Basically working capital would enable us to get a plant of lease of $800 a month and manufacture goods ourselves. My dad has been trying to convince banks to further lend us some but no bank is willing because now me and father both are defaulters.

I see no way out of this, apart from selling the house, which is not a really good option considering the property market in my geography is in a dire state at the moment.

I know I am not responsible for this, but I have accepted full responsibility because it is my signatures that secured the loans. I only did it to help my dad. He has been assuring me since past 15 years that ""I will be debt free, just this one time please."" Out of respect to him because he is my parent, I always complied. 

I have thought of many things. One is, leaving the country and getting a job and just staying out of debt because being debt ridden is the worst thing a human can do to themselves. If I do leave, my dad can always let go of the house and all of his debt. I am a Chemical Engineer from a top institute, plus I have experience working in Fortune 500 companies and a have a good track record with my former employers, so finding a new job in another country where I have a lot of friends won't be that difficult I presume. I want live debt-free.

What should I do? Is there any way out of this?",finance

energy,USA Moves Backwards on Energy Efficiency,"From Politico Morning Energy

&amp;#x200B;

DOE Secretary Perry, former governor of Texas, will publish in the Federal Register today his approval of a petition from conservative ""Competitive Enterprise Institute"" to create a new class of shorter cycle, less efficient dishwashers — marking the latest in a series of rollbacks that aim to weaken rules on light bulbs, furnaces and other appliances,

**The moves are sure to be challenged in court** by advocacy groups, which argue DOE is violating is obligations under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. But Energy Secretary Rick Perry told reporters it comes down to \[his\] ""common sense"", not just statute.

**""From time to time a statute gets written** with a really good intention but reality does not follow that intention,"" he said last week. ""That's why we're looking at these rules and regulations from a common sense approach, we're looking to get the best result we can.""

**Perry's philosophy can be seen in a series of DOE rulemakings.** The agency last week also proposed a rule  in response to a petition from natural gas suppliers and utilities to allow a class of less efficient natural gas furnaces. In February the agency proposed to withdraw an Obama-era rule that would ease efficiency rules on half the light bulb market.

**But the moves face criticism on the Hill,** where Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), who chairs the E&amp;C Energy Subcommittee, told POLITICO: ""To me there is a real divergence between his definition of common sense and my definition of common sense.""",energy

personalfinance,Advice for a student?,"Hello!
I'm about to enter my sophomore year of college and am feeling kind of defeated already. I had to take out 5500 in federal loans to cover my freshman year (roughly half are sub and half are unsub) I wont have to take out any for next year but might for my junior and senior years, as I will be completing nursing courses that have attached fees (maybe about 2-5k more in total).
That doesn't scare me too bad as a nursing job should be able to pay that off in under a year, right?  However, my car is on it's way out and I might have to take out a loan to buy a new (used) car. Good idea? I only make about 7-800 a month. I have about 1800 saved, but dont want a beater cause I cant afford to put in for repairs every month.

personalfinance,Refinance or not?,"I bought my home in 2016 for $263k with a USDA mortgage (0% down), original principal $273k. For those unfamiliar with USDA loans, there is PMI, but it's much lower than other loans with less than 20% down, but you can't get it removed, even after reaching 80% LTV, it's there for the life of the loan. I also took out a HELOC to pay off student loans ($30k, converted type of debt, and at the time the interest was still tax deductible with no sign of that changing). I have no credit card debt save for my monthly expenses (getting cash back rewards, pay off in full). I am considering taking out an auto loan, however, as my wife and I are starting to consider kids and neither of us has a vehicle particularly well suited to transporting children.

Loan Details:

|Mortgage Original/Current Balance|$\~273,000/\~250,000|HELOC Original/Current Balance|$30,000/24,000|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Mortgage Interest Rate|3.375%|HELOC Interest Rate|4%|
|Mortgage Term|30 years|Anticipated Payoff (no other changes)|January 2026?|
|Mortgage Monthly P&amp;I|$1194.53|Current Principal/Interest|$272/128|
|Monthly Escrow Payment (insurance/taxes/PMI)|$65/189.98/107.01|HELOC Annual Fee|$35|
|Mortgage Total Minimum Payment|$1556.52|HELOC Minimum Payment (1% of balance)|$240|
|Mortgage Total Actual Payment|$1700|HELOC Actual Payment|$400|

With the decreasing rates, and with talks of the feds lowering things even more at the end of this month, I'm strongly considering going to a 15 year fixed with enough cash out to pay off HELOC (makes the interest become tax deductible again - our taxes currently tend to border around itemizing vs. standard deduction, even after changes).

There's a lot that makes me question the value of doing that, though.... My wife and I want to move to a piece of land and build a home, possibly as soon as the next year or two (this is WAY up in the air and depends a lot on cash flows once baby(ies) is/are involved). I can't find a calculator that can actually help me figure out when/where the break even point would be because they only compare the closing costs and new interest to the old interest, but I have that pesky PMI to factor in as well, and it would almost seem, sometimes, like my break even point would be a year or two (because that's $1284/year). Not only that, but it would seem like a slam dunk because the payoff for the home would be 15 years from now instead of 27 years from now without much difference in my monthly expenses - that is from calculating a 15 year fixed refinance total loan of $275,000 at 3.375%, added calculator P&amp;I to current monthly insurance/taxes (removed PMI from escrow payment) to estimate minimum payment around $2200, currently paying $2100 for the same debt.

I'm an engineer, so I'm pretty solid on my math skills - it seems to me like being able to deduct the interest, the faster payoff, the same monthly expenses, and removing the PMI all adds up to making a larger impact on the equity in the house and makes this a slam dunk - but I worry I'm seeing the trees and not the forest.

My loan was sold and is now being serviced through American Education Services. 

I will be getting out of the Army in January and AES is telling me that the interest rate will return to the original amount. I have made a lot of headway by overpaying the loan and the payment going back up will severely reduce my ability to pay the loan off quickly.

Being that this is a private loan and it is unsecured, is it likely that another lender will refinance it at a lower interest rate. I would like to keep it near 4% if possible but anything under 11.9% is going to be better.

personalfinance,Twice a year I have to front my company up to 8k (with no idea when I'll get it back). How do I better plan for this?,"I work a job with two busy seasons for travel (three months twice a year), only about ½ of which I can plan ahead for. The other ½ is a “I know it’s Tuesday but we need you on the other coast on Thursday” sort of thing, which gets *really* expensive. Each travel season I rack up 5k-8k in travel costs (over a 2-3 month period), which I pay upfront and then expense back to my company. Getting my money back takes 4-10 weeks, which means not only am I paying a hefty amount of credit card interest while I wait to get my money back, by the time I get it all back it’s just time to start racking up more expense charges. I feel like I can’t keep up. The interest I have to pay for my travel eats away at what I have to pay down my debt.

The issue is that I do not have 8k to front the company, and I have to liquidate my savings, put what I can on my credit card, and ask my mom for loans for the rest (amazing of her to do but humiliating for me). I make 63k, have about $1500 in personal CC debt, and due to some now paid off medical debts, have a credit score in the mid-600s. The limit on my credit card is $4500, so I’m already above the 30% usage threshold just due to my own bad life choices. Because I don’t make much money, carry such a huge balance, and have such shitty credit, I can’t ask for a credit limit increase, and the only cards I could get are at a higher interest rate than what I already have. The last Capital 1 “selected for you!!” offer I got was for like 30% APR. 

Under no circumstances can I use a company card (they are only available to c-suite executives), and I cannot expense the interest I rack up, I have to pay it myself. Going into the travel periods, I have no idea how much I will have to front the company or when they will repay me. Although I budget as much as possible, this makes it really difficult to plan well. Obviously, I’m doing *something* wrong here. I’m missing *something*, I just don’t know what. I’ve of course talked to my leadership about what a problem this is for me, but was told that this is just how it is. How do I better plan for the unknown? When I’m not in a travel period I feel like I’m doing ok financially, I’m paying down my debt responsibly, saving for retirement, and putting away a good savings fund. But then the next travel season comes and destroys all of that. What can I do better here?",finance

economy,Why is there a bond market rush now with negative yield bonds?,"I've been reading a lot about economics over the past month to try and gain an understanding of it and finance. I've been mostly reading Bloomberg articles and researching terms and theories on investopedia.

In the last day or two there have been a lot of articles about the flood of investment into the bond market and the subsequent amount of negative yield government and corporate bonds. These articles say that it's due to the anticipation of the fed interest rate cuts coming up on July 31st.

If I've understood it correctly there's two linked reasons for this.

1. In anticipation of low yield bonds being issued after the fed cuts rates, investors are buying current bonds with a higher interest rate.
2. As the demand grows for these current bonds, prices rise and therefore yield drops since there is an inverse relationship between the two. If I've understood it correctly this relationship occurs because say if a current $100 bond with an interest rate of say 5% (so $5 a year) goes up to $110 then the interest rate will fall below 5% to match the $5 a year amount. Otherwise investors would just buy new $100, 5% bonds.

But my question is that if the fed is due to cut interest rates, why is money going into the bond market? From what I've read I've gained the understanding that generally as interest rates fall investments migrate from bond markets to the stock market, because A) corporations are likely to increase productivity in lower interest rate environments and B) new bonds will have a lower yield.

Where am I going wrong in my thinking? I appreciate I've read a lot about general trends and there are lots of subtleties. For example perhaps investors aren't looking at the stock market too much due to the current trade wars. Or perhaps this whole negative bond yield situation is a stepping stone to a migration of investment from bonds to stock. Or perhaps the stock market is already priced for the upcoming fed cuts.

personalfinance,Wait Until Fed Cuts Rates To Refinance Student Loans?,"Looking to refinance ~$200k in student loans @ weighed 6.1%. Currently have offers from multiple companies for refi rates from 4.5-4.7%. 

I'm not big on trying to time the market, but from what I have read it seems that the Fed it's 99% likely to cut rates at their end of July meeting.

Does it make sense to wait until then to refinance? Or is it more likely that refi lenders have already built in anticipated cuts? Are there other variables to take into consideration? 

Waiting a couple weeks to refinance likely won't affect my potential savings due to accruing interest, but if I can get rates closer to 4 that will result in a significant savings in the long run.",finance

btc,US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin reacts to Libra and the prospect of cryptocurrency,"YouTube: [Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin URGENT Speech on Cryptocurrency](https://youtu.be/c7olI6mnjsM) 27:31

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin made these prepared remarks (emphasis added) and answered questions: 

&gt;
&gt; Last month the Libra Association, a consortium of 28 businesses including a Facebook subsidiary, announced that it is developing a cryptocurrency called the Libra.  The Treasury Department has expressed very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financiers.  Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs, human trafficking...  **This is indeed a national security issue**.
&gt;
&gt; The United States has been at the forefront of regulating entities that provide cryptocurrency.  We will not allow digital asset service providers to operate in the shadows, and will not tolerate the use of the cryptocurrencies in support of illicit activities.  Treasury has been very clear to Facebook, bitcoin users, and other providers of digital financial services, that *they must implement the same anti-money laundering and countering financing of terrorism (known as AML/CFT) safeguards* as traditional financial institutions.  **Money transmitters** of cryptocurrency must comply with the relevant bank secrecy act obligations (known as BSA), and register with the financial crimes enforcement network, known as FINCEN.
&gt;
&gt; **Many people are not familiar with FINCEN.**  It is a bureau of the US Department of Treasury.  *FINCEN's mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit use, combat money laundering, and promote national security through the dissemination of financial intelligence.*  Last year alone it collected over 20 million BSA reports, and has collected over 300 million in the last 11 years.  FINCEN implements the bank secrecy act's regulation and has **federal regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement authority** over money service businesses and banks.
&gt;
&gt; The rules governing money service providers apply to physical and electronic transactions alike.  As money service businesses,  **cryptocurrency money transmitters** are subject to compliance examinations just like every other US bank.  To be clear, **FINCEN will hold any entity that transacts in bitcoin, Libra, or any other cryptocurrency, to its highest standards**.
&gt;
&gt; I also recently established the Financial Stability Oversight Council's Working Group on Digital Assets.  This FSOC group enables US financial regulators, such as FINCEN, the Fed, OCC, CFTSC, CFPB, SEC, and other key stakeholders to work together to combat risks posed by cryptocurrencies.
&gt; 
&gt; As the president has said, bitcoin is highly volatile and based on thin air.  We are concerned about the speculative nature of bitcoin and will make sure that the US financial system is protected from fraud.  Given the international nature of cryptocurrencies we are also going to great lengths to ensure that effective regulation does not stop here at the US border.
&gt;
&gt; Last month, led by the United States, the Financial Actions Task Force, known as FATF, the global standards-setter for AML/CFT, adopted comprehensive measures on how countries must regulate and supervise activities and providers in this space.  This was a major step toward harmonizing international regulations concerning cryptocurrencies.  We have also had extensive work at the G20, and I will be addressing this again this week at the G7 finance ministers in France.
&gt; 
&gt; To be clear, the US welcomes responsible innovation, including new technologies that may improve the efficiency of the financial system and expand access to financial services.  That being said, with respect to Facebook's Libra, and other developments in cryptocurrencies, *our overriding goal is to **maintain the integrity of our financial system** and protect it from abuse.
&gt; 
&gt; **Treasury takes very seriously the role of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency, and will continue our efforts to protect our country and secure the US and global financial systems.**

personalfinance,Cashing out retirement for moving costs?,"I have worked in my current position until I could find a job with my chemical engineering degree. Currently I have $1,187.20 in my retirement 401K plan and now that I am resigning HR is asking if I want to roll it over to my Federal retirement plan at my new job or cash it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

The resignation sheet says I will have to pay a 20% tax but if I have it rolled over to my Federal plan it will not be subject to an additional 10% tax. Now, if I decide to cash out at 30% total tax I will have $830.90 left to help with moving costs. I already have my apartment's first month rent paid so that's not an issue but I would really like to have that extra buffer there. Should I just cash out and have that nice padding to help pay for expenses, buy groceries, new apartment stuff? I will have roommates so I just need to buy a new mattress and some other random things for my bathroom and bedroom (I'm bringing everything except a bed) and will have another 6 weeks of wages at my current job to also help pay for things (roughly $3,000 after taxes, my monthly bills, last month of rent, and student loans). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am moving from the Midwest to the East Coast in the DC area and just taking my car (no UHaul). My Federal retirement is a much higher rate and I am opting to take more out of my check each month to invest in my retirement so I think $830 on top of my $3,000 in wages is well worth to just have in my pocket to pay for gas, one night's stay at a hotel, and food during the move. Is this an okay move? My current job never matched well and will have worked 15 months here.",finance
personalfinance,"Too many financial problems at once. Need advice and a plan to get back on track. (car repair, lost income, roommate moving out)","When it rains it pours and right now my finances are making me want to curl up in a blanket watching Netflix and drinking hot cocoa till the storm passes.

So here’s the situation. First, my daily driver started having mechanical problems to the cost of $2000 after tax. Thankfully my husband caught the problem early and we had some ability to plan and I wasn’t left stranded on the side of the road. In a previous post I brought up the option of trading in the vehicle to finance a new one. We did seriously consider this option but determined it would be best to just spend the money to fix the car and keep driving it till it’s paid off ($6700 remaining). It’s a 2008 Subaru legacy with 155k miles. We own our second car outright.

On top of this situation two income problems arose. First my husband is going through mandatory unpaid half days once a week. At his $16 an hour income these four lost hours a week add up. He is looking for new work but without any college degree finding a good replacement won’t happen overnight. Second, I’m a graduate student who is on contract 9 months of the year. During the summer we are not guaranteed any funding. I was supposed to be funded part time for July and August, this money fell through due to issues and changes with the organization that was supposed to fund the grant. There is a whole bunch more going on here that I could get into but isn’t entirely relevant to the present conversation. So I am currently quasi unemployed looking for a part time job that I would have to quit in two months. I also have no retail or food service experience (always worked in offices). I’m putting my resume out there so we’ll see what happens.

Lastly, my husband and I were sub renting out our basement to roommates. They just gave us 2 weeks’ notice that they are moving out. So that extra $500 a month is gone for the time being. We never needed this extra money to pay our rent and bills and had been using it for debt payoff. However, it would have been really helpful considering the above mentioned issues.

So where does that leave us? We have drained our $1000 emergency fund to help with the car repair. If we have no additional income come in during the next two months, we need about $1700 to get the car fixed and pay our bills till the school year starts back up and I start getting paid again. 

1.	We need cash (not a credit card) to pay some of our bills (like rent). All of our bills are automated through checking currently though they can be changed if absolutely necessary.
2.	I do have access to graduate student federal loans. Up to $16,000 (not that I would take anywhere near that much out) at 6.08%. Since I am in school they would be deferred though would gather interest. The loan would hit my bank around late August, which is too late to completely cover our lack of finances but can be a low interest means to pay back higher interest options to get cash now.
3.	My husband and I both have pretty good credit (around 700) and have a great relationship with our local credit union.
4.	We have about $14000 in credit card debt we’ve been working to pay down. This is across four cards. $4400 on a 0% interest balance transfer card that we pay every month and otherwise pretend like it doesn’t exist, we cannot add anything else to this balance and still get the 0% interest offer. $3500 on each of our credit union credit cards ($7000 total) at 12% and 14%. Both cards have $5000 limits. Lastly we have $2500 on a card at 24% interest and a $3500 limit. I don’t like the idea of getting another 0% balance transfer card, I’d rather just pay down on what we have and stop just getting new cards.

Here was my plan:

1. Pay for the rest of the car repair (about $1000) using the 12% and 14% credit union credit cards. I’d split the difference. Since these cards are not in both my husbands and Is name we like to try and split costs on these cards to keep it even, despite the interest difference. The other two cards are in both of our names, as a note.
2. Get a $700 unsecured personal loan to get us through till school starts back up. This will allow us to pay our bills and keep us afloat.
3. Take out $1700 in student loans to pay back the personal loan and car repair debt that went onto our cards. I’ve thought about taking out more to cover additional credit card debt but have largely seen people recommend to avoid this method of debt repayment and to just grind out CC debt payments.

Is this a good plan? Would there be a better one? Are we completely SOL? Should I just curl up in a blanket with Netflix and hot cocoa? Advise is appreciated.

Two good things: We paid off the last of my medical debt last month so that’s a huge weight off our shoulders. I have less than a year until I graduate with a Ph.D. At that point I can get a normal job that pays at least double if not triple what I currently make and has some health care coverage beyond the student health center.

Edit: I do NOT need advice on finding short term employment. I need advice on my proposed plan and the best way to utilize short term credit options till I start full time employment again in less than six weeks.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

24M LCOL 50K Income 

I had an opportunity to buy a house at under market value a couple of years ago with an FHA loan before I got seriously into tracking my personal finances thanks to this sub and others. House Value - (Zillow) 160,000. A house two doors down with one less bedroom and identical everything else is currently under contract for 190,000. I haven't moved forward with any of this to get an exact appraisal on my home so I would like to estimate this at breaking even (or close) if I were to sell. 121,000 is what I currently owe on the house and my interest rate on the loan is 6.2, my purchase price was 131,000. My payments are 1000/M with PMI, Taxes, and Insurance figured. 

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I have been talking about taking the next step in moving in together, she currently lives about 75 MI from where I do and I commute there already for my current position so end up staying with her most nights to cut the commute down anyways. It seems sensible to both of us to move in to an apartment together closer to where I work and where she already lives. This would cut my monthly housing expenses down to \~500/MO, take a couple hours off my work day, and save on fuel expenses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a complete loss about what to do though, I made the mistake in buying the home, and know that. At the time I had lived with my now ex girlfriend for a period of five years and didn't expect the life changes that came so quickly after I purchased the house, I bought with the intention of living in the house for ten or more years as we had plans to start a family in the future. I would like to know at which point would it make sense if any at all to try to refinance the property to remove PMI and lower the interest making the monthly payment low enough to be cash flow positive for renting the property out through a manager (not something I am interested in doing myself). Or should I just sell the home and be completely down with property ownership? 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I'm not even sure what my chances are of getting the refi or having the refi change much if I were to go through that process. Homes in the area are renting at 1000-1250 a month.

personalfinance,Student Loan Advice,"Hey I'm new here but I want to get my student loans in order since I recently graduated and started a new job. I currently have 3 parent plus loans totaling around $102,000 with an average interest rate of 7.10%. 

My question is, would it be best to refinance these loans into my own name through a private institution to get a lower interest rate. From my understanding the cons of doing this are, I lock myself into a plan where I can no longer adjust the payment term and I lose out on any government forgiveness programs.

Right now I do not qualify for any forgiveness plans because my parents do not work for any agencies where loans may be forgiven over 10 years and I was thinking that since I'm going to be paying these off for the next 10 - 15 years anyway I may as well get the lowest interest rate I can.

My credit is pretty good at around 720-750 so I should be able to qualify for around a 5% interest rate from what I looked up already.

Secondly, my father recently passed and my mother is going to be giving me around $20,000 from a life insurance policy. I was thinking that I would take this money and invest it in some way (not sure about how) and hopefully make use of that in 10 years time since I will most likely be able to afford my loan payments based off my salary; however, my mother thinks I should throw it all into my student loans. 

Any advice would really be appreciated. I am starting to feel a little overwhelmed and would just like to know all my options.",finance

personalfinance,"Found out I have ~$900 sitting in an investment account, what's the best way to use it?","Hello all. Over the weekend, my parents told me about an investment account that my grandfather opened in my name when I was born. There is currently $922.72 in the account. While in the grand scheme of things, I know this isn't that much money, I do want to make sure that I use it the right way.

Some background: I(24), in the past few months, have realized that I have managed to dig myself into a financial hole through irresponsible spending, money management, and credit card debt through my college years. Not a big hole, but a hole nonetheless that is beginning to add pressure and stress to my life. This sub has actually been a huge help in getting me to realize my wrongs, as well as the steps to take to remedy them. Huge thank you to all of the posters and commenters for your advice. Over the past few months, I started using YNAB to budget, as well as finally opened an online savings account with Ally to start building an emergency fund. Budgeting has really helped me get more of a grasp on where my money goes, and just in the short time using the system, I've already found myself a lot less stressed about making bills and payments on time. It has also allowed me to start saving (finally).

Here's my situation at the moment:

I work full time at $11.25/hr. I'm able to pay all my bills, minimum payments, and necessities, with enough to put into savings each week and have a little bit of fun money leftover. I don't think I'm in dire straits.

**Debt**

* Amazon Store Card - $1289.69 (28% APR)
* Captial One Platinum Card - $297.80 (25.49% APR)
* Debt owed to university - $1268.50 (&lt;2% APR)

**Savings**

* Ally Savings Account - $100 (the beginnings of my emergency fund, I am putting in $50 out of each weekly paycheck)

I know these numbers are a bit pitiful, but that's why I'm here to fix that! I also have federal student loans, but those aren't even on my radar (I'm on an income based repayment plan and don't currently have to pay anything on them). The debt to the university was incurred when I dropped out. I am on a payment plan and am very very slowly chipping away at it each month. My parents said that the investment account was originally started to help with school costs, but that I am free to do what I wish with it now. 

My question is, what would be the best course of action now that I have the knowledge of this account? Do I put it towards the credit card debt to curb the interest, and knock one out completely? Do I top off my emergency fund so I'm able to start more aggressively paying down the debt with a cushion just in case? Do I just leave it to keep growing and continue as is? How does one even withdraw from an investment account in the first place?

Thanks in advance for any advice. This sub really is great.",finance

personalfinance,Just got an out-of-the-blue job offer. How do I set salary expectations in a new and obscure field?,"I know that salary negotiations are one of the bread-and-butter, boringly common posts on this sub, so thanks for even opening this post. TL;DR in bold.

I've got a really weird situation on my hands. I've been a US federal government contractor for nine years. The project I work on is one of a kind, and there's no equivalent position to mine outside of this project. In fact, I've been contacted by recruiters who thought they had an equivalent position, and it ended up being completely different. I have an excellent reputation all around; with my company, with adjacent contractors, and with my federal agency. I've made a name for myself by helping to improve the way we do our work, mostly through software bug reporting and feature requests, but I'm known as someone who understands the project and on a regular basis I have higher-ups asking me questions and sending other folks to ask me theirs.

I got a call yesterday from one of the adjacent contracting companies, they work on our in-house software. Our federal agency told them to reach out and hire me in a new position. The position is roughly equivalent to a QA analyst, only they're wanting to hire me because of how thoroughly I understand the program I work on, not my coding skills. The new position entails relocating 2700 miles. Initially, the contractor reached out just to make sure I was interested, now they're working with the agency to come up with a relocation package and job description. While they're doing that, I've been asked to come up with a compensation request.

How much can I expect? I currently gross around $57k. My wife adds another ~~$20k~~ $35k (sorry I'm a dummy who doesn't proofread), and she may or may not be able to make a transfer. In addition, the cost of living is higher (it's scheduled twice what my salary is currently based on), and we'd need to pay for a second car (I currently have a work car). If look at QA analyst positions (again, rough equivalency) in that part of the country, I'm seeing $70-133k depending on experience. I've been working on this project for almost a decade, but they're hiring me for a job doing something completely different than what my experience is in. My BATNA is staying where I am, where I'm happy, and where I'm likely to get a promotion in a few months.

My plan is, benefits being equal to what I make now, to accept no less than $100k, to hope for $120k, and to ask for $130k. The agency specifically asked for me by name, and are building a new position suited to the contributions I've been making. I'm not sure if the new contractor knows how much I'm likely to be making now, but it's likely that they're going to pass on my cost to the agency, and they definitely know how much I make. Is it okay to expect to double my salary?

**TL;DR can I expect to double my salary if I'm moving to a higher cost area, if my wife is losing her job, and a new position is being created specifically for me?**

You guys rock.

EDIT: I think this is helpful: If I turn down this position, they will not hire someone else. In the past, they've tried to arrange things so that I can attend high level meetings, but due to the way the contract is written, I can't do that in my current position. I believe that this is a stepping stone between my current position and taking over the position of one of the folks at the agency that I've been working most closely with.

I actually just realized I can look up that person's salary, because government. They started 15 years ago making $85k (115k adjusted for inflation), now they make $140k.

EDIT EDIT: Okay, that was a super stressful week. I gave them a pie-in-the-sky salary request to start, they balked and gave me a counteroffer at the bottom of the market range, then wouldn't budge from it. I'm not taking the position. It's just not worth the stress at work and the stress of moving. Thanks for all your help!",finance

personalfinance,Juggling spending across two credit cards carrying balances,"So historically we have always spent alternating between two credit cards that were both paid off in full when due.

 Recently, circumstances made it so I have to carry balances on both cards as cash has dwindled. I have a $2k balance on one and $3500 on the other. 

My question is what is the best strategy going forward as far as the card to use for spending? The one with the smallest balance? Continue alternating cards as I have in the past? Switch to using debit/cash for daily spending while also paying down both balances?

Edit: a personal loan was also an option I was considering as I do have good credit. I could pay off both cards and start paying the loan off at a much lower interest rate but I didn’t want to jump the gun so to say and add a 5 year loan if I’m able to catch up on these cards in 6 months.",finance

personalfinance,"$24,000 in debt. Declare bankruptcy or get a personal loan to help pay them off?","3 1/2 years ago I bought a house and moved into it with my sister and her fiance. We were all doing good sharing expenses, I was happily paying 1/3rd of everything while the two of them covered the other 2/3rds. They suddenly moved across the country leaving me to pay 3 times the bills that I normally had been. When that happened I was in a decent job making okay money but I had a long commute and with all the gas, general expenses and not making enough money to support myself, I find myself, about 3 years later, in massive debt.

I have a much better job now, making almost twice as much as I was. After I pay my mortgage, utility bills, car insurance (car is paid for), I have at least $1,000 extra a month to support myself on.

I have 4 credit cards with balances on them totalling about $24,000. The interest rate on them range from 15.15% to 18.24%. I feel like I could easily pay them all off within a few years if it wasn't for the interest. I pay more than the minimum payments on them every month.

I talked to my bank and applied for a personal loan of $20,000. They gave me a rough estimate using the highest interest rate they could give and said my monthly payments would be around $540 for 4 years. That's completely doable for me and would easily payoff 3 of the cards. I could probably even pay off the loan sooner than 4 years. The problem is, I was denied.

My grandparents have told me they would help me get a loan as they have much better credit and better debt to income ratio than I do, but it sounds like they can only get one for $15,000 but I'm unsure of the interest rate.

They also suggested I could file for bankruptcy instead. It would wipe all of my credit card debt off and I could actually live comfortably and save up some money for the first time in almost 4 years. But that worries me, a lot. I want to buy a newer car soon, would bankruptcy hurt that? I also want to move within the next 3 years and build or buy a house which would require a new mortgage. Would I be able to get a mortgage loan 2 years after declaring bankruptcy?

All 3 of my credit scores when I bought my house were over 800. Now I think its in the low to mid 700's. I've never missed a payment or been late on a payment. The only bad thing I have on my credit is just the large amount of debt I have.",finance

personalfinance,Credit Score Development vs. Rapid Debt Payment,"**Background**

I'm in my late 20s.

I wrecked my credit out of college by not paying / properly differing my student loan debt (\~$25,000) while living hand to mouth. I had very little financial literacy beyond not racking up further debt, and honestly at that point  couldn't even see a point in which my life within the foreseeable future in which credit score would even matter. I ended up with a ton of late payments (each of the bundled federal loans was treated as a separate account that had late payments) and eventually defaulted on the loan that, combined with no credit history to speak of previously (didn't use credit cards), drove my score down until it cratered at 492.

Eventually I got my act together. I ended up with a job that now pays almost $70,000 a year, covers my housing expenses separately, and provides full healthcare coverage. I then started the year long process to rehab my loans. That process finished in October of last year and the loans transferred to another provider, though it wasn't until January that I was able to get the balance of the accounts accurately reflected on my credit score (lots of disputes), and for a brief time it reflected \~$50,000 in loan debt. When that $50,000 cleared to \~$25,000 my score jumped 150 points in a two month period (to the high 690s).

I while that rehab process was happening I also had to buy a replacement vehicle, most of which was financed (used car, \~$10,000), which I've been making payments on for three years (\~$5,000 in principle left - yes, the interest rate was terrible).

In the last six months I finally started reaching out to open a couple credit cards to start building credit history (one card in February, one card in April), both of which I pay off entirely each month. I travel frequently for work, and not having a credit card had become a tremendous headache with rental cars. The first card ended up with a far smaller available limit than I'd hoped ($1,000), which led to the second ($2,000). I'd like to request a credit line increase on the second at some point, just to help potential utilization issues down the line. I've probably cleared something like \~$7,000 through the two cards in the last six months between hotels and rental cars required for work travel, but again, have aggressively paid them down, often making payments multiple times in a month to clear available available credit for the next expense. Cash flow is *not* a problem.

Since the high in February in the high 690s, I've seen my credit score slowly bleeding a few points every month. My last report from Experian showed a 680. I expected taking out new lines of credit to sting for a month or two, but the drop month after month with no changes to payment history or utilization (I've never carried a balance into the next month) is sort of freaking me out, and really frustrating me since I was only a couple points short of 700, and it keeps dropping.

Now, with all that said, next month I get reimbursed on some work expenses, get a bonus, and can reasonably expect to come into a total of something like $30,000 in cash. Essentially enough to completely clear all my debt. That seems like a no brainer to me - pay off the loans, stop the interest payments, especially on the remaining principle on the vehicle, but being somewhat new to trying to manage credit score and the like, I had some concerns that getting rid of essentially all of my periodic and longer accounts, save two new credit cards, could have a negative impact.

At this point my largest concern is trying to build my credit score and set up long term success. My expenses are low other than the car payment and student loan payment: phone bill ($50), utilities (\~$150), car insurance (\~$100), Netflix (\~$15). *I know the general sub rule here is 'pay down loans first, pay them down fast, do not keep them for credit score', just wondering if there are specific factors that might lean it one way or another, given my generally (very) stable financial position and credit woes.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**Seeking some specific guidance on the following:**

\-Why my credit score continues to drop and ways I can help it

\-Whether paying off completely my two (oldest) accounts immediately will have negative or positive short and long term effects on credit score, and guidance on way forward there. Interest rates on the student loans vary

\-Suggestions on ways to improve credit score generally beyond continuing on-time payments and low utilization

\-Suggestions on the best ways to open additional lines of credit / expand available credit

The Four Sectors of the Global Collective: 

Guidelines for Collectives and Individuals

&amp;#x200B;

In order to create a society that is the antithesis of the one we currently have, a litany of changes are necessary. The most notable of these is a fundamental reformulation of the way our social institutions behave. Today’s institutions exist to preserve themselves and the status they hold within our culture. Institutions that are static, meaning that they resist change to stay in place and maintain control, are both inefficient and counterproductive. We need a set of institutions that are dynamic as opposed to static; a set of institutions that embrace change at every moment in order to become more streamlined and efficient as they evolve. The following is a list of suggested institutions for The Global Collective. These four sectors will replace our current political, economic, and educational institutions. 

Collective Guidelines

1. Fundamental Education and Periodic Inquiry

a) The institution of education will be considered the most integral part of the Global Collective. Groups of  people will  participate in the collective pursuit of knowledge. These groups will be led, but not controlled, by individuals with  significant experience in the specific field of study.

b) In addition to study of specific fields of interest, every individual will receive the same degree of general education. The end goal of this general education is to cultivate individuals that are well informed, critically thinking, and inquisitive. 

c) Both groups and individuals will be encouraged to ask any questions they might have. Furthermore, at periodic intervals, groups will be asked to take a step back and ask how and why everything works the way it does. These groups will also be challenged to see if they can come up with any improvements or tweaks that could more effectively streamline a procedure or process.

2. Resource Sustainability and Future Projection

a) Availability and quantities of resources will be updated in real time so that rates of usage never exceed rates of production. These updates will be automated to the highest degree possible.

b) Levels of efficiency will be assessed and recorded so that action may be taken if a procedure or process is unsustainable.

3. Constructive Cooperation and Analytical Diagnostics 

a) Groups of willing and capable individuals will address and attempt to solve any societal problems that  may arise; these  individuals will do so under the guidance of the scientific method so that they will remain objective throughout the process.

b) Problems will be analyzed as they arise. The root cause of dilemmas will be diagnosed when possible.

When the root cause of a problem can be determined, the solution should come from addressing the problem at its source; as opposed to addressing the symptoms caused by the problem.

c) Groups of people will be encouraged to examine problems from different perspectives. Analysis of problems from varying perspectives will provide fresh insight into different methods of solving problems.

4. Societal Integration and Dynamic Feedback

a) Groups of people will be encouraged to participate in recreational activities. These recreational activities  will promote both the release of stress and the strengthening of social bonds between group members.

b) Open expression of thoughts and ideas will be encouraged in any and all arenas. Upon completion of any activity; educational, constructive, or recreational, the participants will be asked to provide feedback about  the procedure or process.

Individual Guidelines

1. Comprehensive Education     a) Background information relating to desired goal is provided.    b) Instruction is given about how best to achieve said goal by individuals who have already done so.   c) Instructors will answer all questions to the best of their ability.

2. Resource Management     a) Any resources or facilities required for goal attainment are provided.     b) Guidance and assistance are provided by experienced individuals. 

3. Goal Attainment    a)Time and effort are put towards desired goal, and either the goal is reached, or the individual falls short.   b) Future guidance is provided to individuals striving to achieve the same goal.    c) If an individual’s goal is not realized, reasons are noted to assist other individuals in the future.

4. Expression and Feedback   a) Suggestions and feedback about the goal attainment process are provided; suggestions are noted and implemented if doing  so is practical.     b) Any artistic or creative urges relating to the goal attainment process are encouraged to be expressed.

On the Maintenance of Social Equality

Class differentiation has existed since the foundation of civilization, consequently, it is hard to imagine a world in which it does not exist. But, our society is rapidly transitioning out of the industrial age and into the technological age. If we are able to effectively phase into the technological age, the creation of a utopia becomes a realistic possibility. As technology continuously improves, eventually scarcity will become an outdated convention. In a world where scarcity is no longer an issue, goods are produced in enough abundance to be freely available. If goods are freely available and have no cost assigned to them, the means of class differentiation disappear. 

In order for society to move past classism, society must also move past the definition of oneself by their material possessions. The importance our current society places on possessions is a product of consumer culture. Moving past the dependence on ownership of objects is essential to the maintenance of social equality. Admittedly, there are a lot of nice, luxurious things in the world. But, the bond a person has with an inanimate object can never come close to the comradery of life-long friendship. Real-world connections with others are what truly matters. Furthermore, a greater quality of life can be achieved by devoting one’s time to pursuing passions. This will create a greater degree of fulfillment than spending one’s life pursuing status symbols.

The profit mechanism is the root cause of the majority of the problems our society faces today. Not only is it the source of the chasm between the upper and lower classes, but it is the cause of extensive harm to our environment. Some people would argue that competition for the sake of profit encourages innovation. But competition in the context of profit is counterproductive, because competing parties are only striving to be marginally better than their rivals. If a company were to make a significantly superior product than their competitors: then they may spend too much to produce it and not turn a profit. Furthermore, a vastly superior product that doesn’t become obsolete within a few years would put the producer out of business. Planned obsolescence goes hand in with cyclical consumption, and cyclical consumption goes hand in hand with unnecessary waste of resources. And lastly, the profit mechanism encourages harm to the environment. This is the case because practices and policies that have the least impact on the environment are often the most expensive. If a company can make more money by sacrificing the wellbeing of the environment, they will do so. The profit mechanism must not exist in a world that is to remain viable for human life.

Many individuals find the root of their identity in their nationality. By no means is culture a crime, but at times national prejudices serve as a wedge that drives groups of people apart. Without the existence of nations, the separation of peoples into competing factions becomes more difficult, and the creation of collective cooperation at a societal level becomes more realistic.

Religion, and the devotion to one’s personal God, is a very sensitive issue. But the fact that preference of one benevolent deity or another can oftentimes inspire deep seated hatred between groups of people, is concerning and unsettling. My hope for the future, as should be yours, is that people are able to look past their differences and put more emphasis on their similarities. By doing this, we will actually be adhering to the Golden Rule instead of deviating from it.

On Improving the Quality of Human Life

In the Global Collective, Education will be the most fundamental part of our society. Currently, education is primarily geared towards preparing people to enter the work force. This means that all the resources and energy of educational institutions are spent grooming students to be active participants in an endless cycle of consumption. Learning solely for the sake of knowledge is a practice that is almost completely extinct in today’s world. The majority of people see knowledge or college diplomas as a means to an end; the end of having a good job and enough money to be happy. But this pursuit is a fallacy. True happiness can be found in the pursuit of knowledge and engaging in logical discourse with those around you. In the Global Collective, exchange of information and ideas is essential to the continuous improvement of our citizens.

In the same theme of not defining oneself by their possessions, people will also not be defined by the luxury of the house in which they live. Housing situations will be both practical and pragmatic; never lavish or excessive. People will have the choice of living alone, in communes, or with family members. 

The major emphasis of healthcare will be on prevention as opposed to reaction. A high degree of diseases and conditions that arise in today’s healthcare systems are easily preventable if there were more proactive measures in place, as well as a better mindset about health. A new healthcare system with a holistic approach to health and medicine will work best for both the providers and recipients of care. 

Many people would argue that violence is an inescapable part of human nature, but I would have to disagree with this assertion. The only reason human civilization has progressed this far and become this advanced, is our ability to work cooperatively. There is still a lot of room for our improvement, and this improvement could be more easily accomplished if the broader societal mindset placed less emphasis on individuality and more emphasis on collectivity.

The setting and realization of goals, as well as the expression of thoughts and ideas, are essential parts of leading a fulfilling life. Not only are these activities fulfilling, but they can be therapeutic as well. Active engagement with the people around us and the world around us will help to combat the recurring dysfunction that we see in the world today.

Concluding Remarks and Hopes for Our Future

Transforming our culture from one of excessive waste into one that is sustainable into the future will be a long and arduous process. But, it is a process that must be undertaken if we want to have a future to speak of. We are at a turning point as a species, and we must collectively choose either failure or success. Making sustainable living choices as an individual is a step in the right direction, but these choices can only go so far when the broader mindset is one of apathy and indifference. The beginning of this long road starts with informing the people around you that there is a better alternative to the way the world works. But this better alternative will never be realized if we cannot work together to change the status quo of our culture. As more and more people become aware of the state of dysfunction our current society is in, more and more people will have a thirst and desire for real, comprehensive change for the better. Eventually, as more people are awakened, it is possible that world governments, and not just individuals, would want to sign on to the idea of The Global Collective. When this happens, an interim federation of countries that agree with the ideals of The Global Collective can be formed. As momentum continues to grow, and a majority of countries join the federation, the realization of our goal is within sight. Once every country signs on and joins the federation, the federation will cease to exist and The Global Collective will be realized.

The ideas set forth in this document are in no way intended to rob people of their individuality. They are instead a means to level the playing field from which people begin. Individuals in The Global Collective will not define themselves by the amount of money they have, the kind of car they drive or by the size of their home. Our citizens will be defined by the contributions they make to our society, by the original thoughts they share with others and by the positive effect they have on the world around them. Every person in The Global Collective will be encouraged to realize their full potential. Furthermore, within The Global Collective, dishonesty subversion and manipulation will not be seen as means toward obtaining an end. A broad shift in societal mindset is required. This can only be achieved with collective solidarity applied over the course of several decades. The end goal is the realization that your own well-being is not above and beyond the well-being of others, and that the well-being of our planet in its entirety is a necessity. You are a part of a greater whole, with a greater purpose; if the greater whole realizes its full potential, then all parts within that whole will realize their full potential. 

The framework put forth in this document is far from perfect, but it is a significant step in the right direction. Eventually, this will be more than just a list of ideas on a piece of paper, it will be a way of life. The greatest requirement is the ability to act. If the propositions in this document resonate with you, I implore you to take some degree of action to help me expand this message. At the very least, take the time to discuss these ideas with a friend. To be more involved: Take pictures of this paper and share them with others or make photo copies of this paper and pass them out to others. If you desire change, do not fail to act; make the world a better place to the best of your own ability. The positivity you put out will return to you in one form or another.

This document is overtly encouraging a revolution. But, such revolution can by no means be achieved through the use of violence. Violence is contrary to the ideals of The Global Collective. Any revolution involving violence would only lead to a continued repetition of past mistakes. We require a revolution to end all revolutions. We require a revolution to destroy the idea of social class. Our revolution can only be achieved through non-violent non-compliance. The best way to stop the system that is currently in place is by refusing to participate: we must collectively refuse to be a part of the endless cycle of consumption. The cycle of consumption only benefits those at the top, and we need a system that equally provides for all citizens. We will make our voices heard. Human beings are much more than cogs in a machine that exists only to reap vast profits from both the subjugation of the down-trodden and the rape of our mother earth. If all the small cogs of that machine collectively refuse to turn, the entire mechanism will come to a grinding halt. And, at this point, there is no other option. Our biosphere is rapidly approaching a level of damage from which it will be unable to rebound. It is fundamental to realize that all parts of our planet are interconnected. We all come from and return to our biosphere, and willful destruction of that biosphere is literal suicide. We, the silent majority that will no longer remain silent, choose life instead of death. We choose integrity and truth as opposed to dishonesty and subversion. We choose to invest in our future rather than to stagnate in our past. We choose to go forward hand in hand, side by side, instead of using the backs of others as stepping stones to the top. We choose an existence of substance, meaning and value as opposed to one of mediocrity, repetition and squandered potential. But, most important of all, We choose to do it together and not alone.

My name is Nicholas Kolozvary and I am the author of the text contained in this document. In order for these goals to be realized, a great degree of both networking and feedback are required. Please reach out to those around you and discuss the best means of actualizing comprehensive change. Whether or not you agree with my ideas, please contact me to offer any advice or constructive criticism you might have. If you would like to download digital copies of my document, in full size or handout form, visit the Omnitopia website listed below. Also, any tips about how to network and organize this movement would be greatly appreciated. Doing this alone is an impossibility. But together, any goal is achievable.

personalfinance,Seriously Bad Mortgage,"Coworker has an interest rate of 8.9%, raising to 9.9% in September. It is a 5 year fixed ARM. He has had this mortgage for 13 years and the principal never budged. This was a crap mortgage, even for an ARM. It’s the 6 month LIBOR + 7.9% margin!

Flash forward to today. Kid’s been a bit reckless with his credit with 2 accounts in collections ($1000 and $9000) and a 530 credit score. No one will even talk refinance with a score that low.

Another kicker is that this mortgage isn’t backed by Fannie or Freddie. He is above water LTV $94000 note / $100000 house.

I consider myself to be pretty proficient in finance, but this one has me stumped. Is there anything he can do? Legal avenues? Alternative mortgages?

personalfinance,"Amending taxes unilaterally for transferred tuition tax credits - Ontario, Canada","Thanks in advance, this is kind of convoluted. 

Does anyone know if it's possible to unilaterally ""untransfer"" federal tuition tax credits in a tax amendment? Or even change that at all? 

In 2015, it was my first time doing taxes and my parents' accountant transfered nearly all of my tuition tax credits to them, even though my tuition was being paid from an RESP under my name, and was therefore considered my income. Due to this I've had to pay thousands in taxes on RESP money. 

I feel that I was misled since the accountant said that he'd be claiming my tuition under my parents, not a tax credit. I am looking to try and make an amendment, however wanted to see if anyone knew if something like this was even possible.",finance

Two questions: is this a good way to pay for it? And where can I get the lowest interest rate and the least loan origination fees: the dealership, my bank, or somewhere else?

personalfinance,UPDATE: I took your advice (mostly). So now here is my plan.,"Off of this thread:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/c9a2r8/first\_time\_making\_a\_real\_budget\_and\_debt\_payment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/c9a2r8/first_time_making_a_real_budget_and_debt_payment/) 

&amp;#x200B;

I chose to pay for the car in cash and bought a used Honda CR-V for $3400.  I realized I was looking at the monthly payments compared to my take home pay, and ignoring the fact that I was still going to commit myself to 20K-25K worth of more debt.  I'm OK with owing on a car and making car payments but I could set myself up for so much more success if I can get by over the next two years with minimal car costs.

I did take out an online auto loan for $8000 at 8%.  I wanted to have cash on hand for when I bought something and did not know what I would spend so I wanted head room.  I could pay that back in full right now and there is no prepayment penalty.  But I am thinking about paying off my credit cards with the money instead.  Essentially lowering my interest rate from 24% to 8%.

**Will the lender care what I do with the money as long as they get paid on time each month?  In fact wouldn't they prefer I  did not pay it back so that they can earn interest off me?** 

I'm nervous about owning an older high mileage car but I feel good about not committing $300/month towards an auto loan. I used a debt repayment calculator and realized how much the $300 was going to accelerate my debt-free plans.  Especially after the Discover card is knocked out, the rest of the debts fall off so quickly.",finance
personalfinance,Options for consolidating credit debt with poor credit score,"Hey guys,

My current situation is I'm just shy of $20,000 in credit card debt with my largest balance on one credit line being $10,100. I'm starting a new job in August and have been out of work since April. My 2018 income was 57,000 and a monthly pretax income of $4775. My credit score has taken a beating since leaving my job in April, dropping from over 680 to now just above 600.

personalfinance,Does my Autoloan and Interest amount make sense?,"To keep it simply I have an autoloan of 22K. Minimum payment is $497( made it a short term loan @6%?

Anyways I make $1500 payments each month to pay it off. I noticed that sometimes the interest amount fluctuates.

For example:

My first 3 payments at $1500- the interest amount was $110, 84.60, then 85.60.

After paying off more of the principal, the interest amount that was billed for the last two $1500 payments was $307 and $214. 

I thought after paying down the principal amount the interest rate will follow..? But it seems like the opposite? I have currently paid off 75% of the loan within 1 year but still notice my interest amount fluctuating drastically(100s of $) why is that?

btc,Fed Chair Powell FULL Senate testimony on monetary policy – 07/11/2019,"[Youtube Fed Chair Powell FULL Senate testimony on monetary policy – 07/11/2019 (1:42 crypto section)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSRfoBp_Fq0&amp;t=6230s)

Highlights (Peppered with a LOT of nervous-sounding throat-clearing)

* Brief mention of stablecoins, he says no other crypto is capable of scaling like Libra could.
* Question about USD reserve currency status - could Bitcoin subvert it?

*“People have been talking about \[the actually adoption of Bitcoin\] since  cryptocurrencies emerged, but we haven’t seen it, that’s  not to say we won’t—and if we do, then yes, you could see a return to  an era in the United States where we had many different currencies, in  the so-called* ***national banking era***\*.”\*

*“I think things like that are possible, but we really haven’t seen  widespread adoption, Bitcoin is a good example, almost no  one uses it for payments. It’s a speculative store of value like gold.”*

*""The US lags in realtime equitable payment systems, other countries are way ahead of us"".*

&amp;#x200B;

I see some surprising revelations in this testimony. First, it's highly unlikely that a central bank chairman would believe ""just hodl bro gold-like SoV 4eva"" nonsense about BTC. So he's likely parroting the mainstream ""Blockstream/Twitter Maxi party line"". I can think of several reasons he would do this. Also he tacitly admits that Bitcoin can't threaten the Fed fiat system due to its limited capacity. Also, he completely ignores all other cryptocurrencies (which are FAR more scale-ready than BTC, hint hint BCH) and mumbles something about stablecoins.

Finally, in Powell's hand-wave to the ""national banking era"" he is fastidiously avoiding the *real analogous historical banking period*, the Wildcat banking era, also known as the Free Banking Era.

personalfinance,Another round of variable vs fixed rate loan refinance,"I am going to be refinancing my hefty (both in dollar amount and interest rate) student loans from medical school and am trying to figure out going fixed vs variable interest rate on the refi. Most of the advice I see is lock it in with the low fixed rate and don't bother with the headache of variable rates. All my forum scouring pointed me to a general consensus that the variable rate will inevitably take over the fixed rate and in the long run it is unlikely to be worth it. Or better put: variable is typically not worth the potential risk and/or anxiety that comes along with it.

&amp;#x200B;

When are the reasonable situations that it's worth it? There has to be some combination of short enough duration of payback, big enough starting difference between variable rate vs fixed rate, etc. that work right?

&amp;#x200B;

I have $280K-ish in total principal after capitalization. I have every intention of paying it down super aggressively and thanks to a high salary in a low cost of living area I should be able to do so by setting my payment above the minimum each month (aka prepaying). 7 years is the absolute max length I want to pay this loan and honestly \~3 years would be preferred. The rates I've been offered and am choosing from are:

5yr fixed 3.51% - $5131/month

7yr fixed 3.74% - $3821/month

5yr variable 2.74% - starting at $5035/month

I'm not listing the others since I'm not considering longer terms and the 7yr variable was around the same rate as the 5 yr fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

If I plan to prepay to a total monthly payment of $6K, $7K, or even $8K my DTI ratio would be comfortable-ish ranging from \~0.25 to 0.33 (my monthly payments would equal 25 to 33% of my gross monthly income) and I would pay off the loans quicker with less total interest obviously. I am strictly looking at my student loans and my salary as the only debt and income when calculating the DTI since my wife's salary can take care of our other debts (car payment, mortgage, etc). At $8K/month the loan would be paid off in 3 years - good timing to re-evaluate moving vs staying, buying a new home, considering other jobs etc as we will then be debt free (not including the mortgage).

&amp;#x200B;

With this prepay plan it seems like it would make sense to take the 5yr variable right? Even at $6K/month I would *always* be paying well over the minimum payment and I would be paying more money into the principal earlier (\~$180 more per month at 2.74% vs 3.51%).

&amp;#x200B;

Devil's advocate: even if the variable magically averaged 2.74% for the life of the loan it would only shave, at best, 1 month off my payments compared to even the 3.74% 7yr fixed rate (\~$6750 total interest saved at 6K/month, \~$5650 total at 7K/month, \~$4850 total at 8K/month) for a total of &lt;2% of my starting principal or \~$135/month less over the 50 months it would take to pay the loan off at $6K/month. The other benefit of the 7yr fixed is if for whatever reason I needed to drop the monthly payments for short term cash on hand I would be able to have an extra $1200/month in my pocket when comparing the minimum payments.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

I used [this student loan calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/college-planning/loan-calculator.aspx) to crunch my numbers since it allowed me to alter monthly payments for prepaying, see the payoff dates, see total interest paid, showed the amortization calendar, etc. Super handy.",finance

ethereum,Is DeFi based on a false premise?,"I'm a huge fan of the various DeFi protocols (MakerDAO, Compound, dYdX, Dharma and many more) that have sprung up on Ethereum - they show the power of composable protocols, smart contracts and retail finance.

However, one concern is that their success all seems to be based on the supposition that the value of ETH will rise (over the long term). Whilst this may be true for a while (or not ;-)), presumably at some point the value of ETH will stabilise.

&amp;#x200B;

Interest rates (e.g. for DAI, USDC) and DAI itself are based on over-collateralisation which really only makes sense if you're expecting the underlying to appreciate in value (or there is some value to holding the underlying, i.e. it is a house you can live in). Without that AFAICT protocols like MakerDAO &amp; the other lending protocols don't really make any sense to use.

I pay $355 a month for car payments, $260 principle pay. And around $90 in interest. I only figured this out now after more than half a year of paying it, because I just created an account to see the details of the car payment. There are 21 more months left to pay off this car. I’ve spent at least $6,000 this year on oil changes, water pump replacement, control arms for suspensions, piston misfiring engine problems, new wheels, brakes, AC, all sorts of problems and I’m sick of paying so much for repairs. Every week I spend $50 on premium gas since the car burns gas so fast.

CryptoMarkets,Mnuchin could have started nailing the coffin down on LIBRA,"[in case you didn't see the press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDmhT9UZPIk)

[press release](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm731)

This might be soooo two days ago, but if Mnuchin thinks the total investments in Bitcoin and/or cryptocurrency as a whole is just a rounding error in the global financial books, then why is he addressing them in a special press conference? To be fair, he did make it clear that only transactions via cryptocurrency that break current laws are the ones that need to be scrutinized.

The whole thing reeks to me like a red herring to distract us from what is actually happening, but I could be way off on that one. I also think it's not a coincidence that this announcement is coming just weeks after the LIBRA announcement which has gotten people been pretty riled up about cryptos, including the [POTUS](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1149472282584072192) himself. 

Point is, if the (growing) market cap of cryptos is a rounding error, Bitcoin can't really be seen as such a big threat, not one that would justify a press conference, and certainly not one that would justify specialized law enforcement appointed by the highest-ups at the Department of the Treasury to handle. I'm keeping my eyes peeled to see what kind of crimes the feds come up with in a potential crusade against cryptos.

personalfinance,"First time poster, looking for confirmation about paying debts.","Hey guys!

&amp;#x200B;

Sooo Ive been lurking here for a bit and through viewing other posts I think I've setup a good plan to eliminate my CC debt.  I just wanted to see what yall thought about it.  I knuckled down and started actually budgeting, first trying Mint and YNAB before settling on my own google sheets method. Given that i have remained static at the same amount of CC debt, I feel comfortable that once I get the balances back to 0 I will be able to keep them there :D

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have about $10,000 in CC debt, spread over 5 cards, with various interest rates ranging from 20% to 26% (yikes!)

&amp;#x200B;

I have an auto loan with about $3000 left, at 9.5%

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $9000 in student loans, at 4.6%

&amp;#x200B;

I have $200,000 Mortgage with a 4% rate.

&amp;#x200B;

That sums up all my debts.  I have budgeted spending %17 of my income for the next few years on paying off my CC, Auto, and Student debt.    I plan on doing minimum payments on my Mortgage, student loans, and auto loan.  I will target the highest interest rate CC for all my extra payments, the rest of my cards will get minimum payments.  Once that first card is paid off, whatever amount I was paying per month on the first card, starts getting used to pay off the next card and so on until the CC debt is gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Doing normal payments on my auto loan it will be paid off about 6 months before my last CC is paid off, allowing me to accelerate the payoff of that last CC even more.

&amp;#x200B;

At that point I will be in a healthy place, and will snowball that 17% over to my mortgage all as extra principal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas/tips/tricks that I should be aware of?  I assume this is pretty much the optimal pay off method but figured I would ask.

personalfinance,Using opportunity of low interest rates,"Hello everybody,

&amp;#x200B;

for some time I've been planning this little money game of mine. Currently in my country mortrage interest rates are around 1% what is crazy in my point of view and I see it as opportunity to gain some money. In short we (my gf and I) would like to take a mortrage at one of her flats and invest acquired money.

&amp;#x200B;

More closely situation is that my long-term gf own 2 flats which she is both renting, mortrage would be around 35/40% of its value. Then I would invest this money in some selected common funds. We have very healthy financies with more than 6 months of our monthly expenses saved (our income is made of my salary, payments from two flats, some family support \[gf is still studying\] etc. etc. so there is almost zero chance losing all of it at once) and monthly money excess which would pay the mortrage payment three times. All this would take timespan of 3-5 years and ideally would gain much more than 1%. Also in my point of view this would make it easier for us to save money, when you have to pay :-) Also we are in no way planning to buy flat in the city where we are living now in these 3-5 years, we want to try living in different locations first.

financialindependence,Incremental Tax Comparison with ACA Healthcare Considerations,"I couldn't help but wonder how Affordable Care Act (ACA) payments might impact an individual's decision to contribute more earnings to roth vs. traditional.  I decided to do some research on my own and see if I could come up with any key takeaways.  I am not a tax expert by any means.  Please kindly let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements or changes.

&amp;#x200B;

I mostly wanted to develop numbers that would show what your marginal tax rate for certain MAGI levels during early retirement might be.  The same findings could be applied to someone who has not retired early but is trying to find the optimal income range to make the most out of ACA subsidies.  For early retirees, this could be compared to current marginal tax rates that you might be paying.  Obviously, take these numbers with a grain of salt, laws could change at any point in the future.  Also, state considerations were not included in this analysis, so everyone will also have to make adjustments for their respective state.

  
The methodology I used was to simply add any sort of out of pocket ACA expenses into the tax bucket.  Think of it as, any healthcare costs are an unavoidable expense.  For that reason, we can assume personal healthcare expenses and tax can be combined for comparison purposes.  This allows us to determine something that is very similar to marginal tax rates except that it will be during a time at which someone is eligible for ACA subsidies.  This was done by comparing what each incremental tax plus out of pocket ACA payments would be at various optimal income points.

&amp;#x200B;

These are using U.S. average healthcare costs (2nd best silver plan) based on the above website.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on these results, I would recommend trying to target a MAGI of $12,139 during early retirement using your roth conversions if your current federal tax bracket is 12% and you expect to be single with no kids.  This is vastly different than what most people may think which is to target a MAGI of $38,700 which is the top range of the federal marginal 12% tax bracket when ignoring ACA subsidies.  Again, laws could change in the future so I would not recommend trying to optimize based on ACA subsidies unless you are already close to your target early retirement date.  State specific criteria should aslo be considered.  Also, remember that once you are collecting social security the formula changes or if you are no longer eligible for ACA subsidies the formula changes again.",finance

My two biggest loans are as follows:

I have $11,000 in student loans with an estimated monthly payment of $50.00. I plan to pay this off in 3 years at approx $305 per month at a 5.5% interest rate.

I have a $15,998 car note which I pay $450 a month toward - this will be payed off in 3 years with a 4.64% interest rate.

My biggest monthly expense that will take affect between 3-6 months after graduation is as follows:

Monthly rental payment of approx. $1000.

My plan is to budget to pay off the car note and student loans in 3 years. This will be $755 a month that will be automatically deducted from my paycheck.

I currently have just over $3300 in savings and $2050 in a Rollover IRA with Fidelity.

Ideally, I will have these loans payed off by age 25.

Can someone please asses my financial situation and advise me if this is a good plan or please provide alternatives and suggestions. Any other advice is greatly appreciated. Please don't sugar coat. I will do whatever it takes to achieve the American Dream.",finance

investing,Foreign Impact on the Yield Curve and Signalling,"Seems lately there's been a lot of comments/posts talking about the importance of the inverted yield curve and how it's signalling an imminent market/economy collapse.  I thought it might be beneficial to contribute to the yield curve mania with my limited understanding of it and explanation for why it's inverted.

&amp;#x200B;

My main issue with all these posts is it appears to me (Disclaimer that I have very little experience investing) people are basing their decisions off of one single indicator.  If someone applied that same logic to stocks (e.g. ""I decided to buy this stock solely because they have a 10% dividend rate"") they would more than likely get ridiculed.  Especially if they chose an arbitrary point of data, which is what people are doing with the yield curve.  I think it's far more beneficial to examine and talk about the reason behind the yield curve making the movements it does

&amp;#x200B;

This may be an overly-simplified view of the yield curve but the way I see it there's a combination of 4 factors that would cause the yield curve to exhibit pressure to move one way or the other:

1. An increasing 3 month treasury yield that can be caused by 2 reasons:

a. Decreased demand for 3 month treasuries

b. Increased supply of 3 month treasuries

2. A decreasing 10 year treasury yield that can be caused by 2 reasons:

a. Increased demand for 10 year treasuries

b. Decreased supply of 10 year treasuries

&amp;#x200B;

I'm unable to find any numbers on how the supply of different denomination treasuries changes so I'm going to go ahead and assume that those are held relatively static by the fed for all intents and purposes.  This means at it's core, the issue that causes the yield curve to move in an inverted direction is that **people have a higher demand for long term debt.**  I think it makes sense that people favoring long term debt would be a factor in a recession since it shows that there's a lack of confidence in the economy.  

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't think is being consider is the increasing impact that the global economy has on the U.S. economy.  U.S. notes have been increasingly owned by foreign investors at a much higher rate than any other group ( [https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2018/03/09/on-the-supply-of-and-demand-for-u-s-treasury-debt](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2018/03/09/on-the-supply-of-and-demand-for-u-s-treasury-debt)).  Because of this I think it may make sense that:

A.  The largest factor in the current yield curve inversion is increased foreign demand for long-term securities that's more due to uneasiness in the global economy as opposed to uneasiness specifically targeted at the U.S. economy.

B.  It's not a perfect comparison to look at the yield curve now and compare it to what happened 10-50 years ago when such a big factor of it has had such a large change.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, investing is a very personal choice that's dependent on your own tolerance for risk and goals, so continue to do what you want with your money, I just thought this was an interesting perspective that I never see talked about in yield curve discussions.  Also happy to hear any critiques people have about my chain of thought.  I'm relatively new to investing and eager to learn why I'm wrong.",finance

So, I was financing the Focus for a 48 month term, paying $121 bi-weekly. I paid one year on it before trading into the Elantra. The finance amount on the focus was around $11,000 total. I made a really quick (possibly uneducated) decision on the 2016 Elantra, and now have an 84 month finance term, paying $165 bi-weekly, around $28,000 total on the loan. This is because of negative equity, and the loan remainder from the Focus.

Basically, I need advice on the best possible course of action to shave my payments down. I don't really want to be paying this thing off for 84 months, and especially at $165 bi-weekly.

Thanks for any advice, kind people of Reddit.

Edit: The sale price on the Focus was $7,995 when I bought it, the Elantra GT sale price was $14,992 when I traded.

Edit 2: I make $2500 monthly, pay 379 monthly for insurance on this Elantra, loan is held with Scotiabank with a 4.49% interest rate. I'm with my folks at home right now, and am lucky enough to not be paying rent as of now. So my monthly expenses total just over $1000 right now. My savings total $6000 right now.",finance
investing,Can someone help me solve a hedging exercise?,"Here's the question:

Your EU based company receives in half a year a payment of $250,000.

personalfinance,Gut Check on Finances @ 28,"Good Afternoon PF Redditors,  


First time posting here.  I have a strong desire to learn about finances, to obtain better finances, and to work on improvement. I've been doing it under the radar for years.  However, I'm at the point where I'm going to be bringing on another person into my financial life. I'm getting married next year.   


I've been searching to kind of get a sense of where ""most people my age"" are in terms of finances, but it's an odd little bit of data to really get.  The responses are varying wildly. So, I figured I would just ask - and take some true, hard, advice on where things are / where they should be, and possible ways to improve.   


Below is a run-down on my financial life:  
Age: 28  
Annual Salary: 84,000 (Software/IT Field)

401k Balance: 54,000  
Roth IRA Contribution: 500/month  
Roth IRA Balance: 8100  
Housing: Owned, paying mortgage (1300/mo), 165k left to pay  
Car: 165/mo, \~ 600 left to pay (Will be paid in December)  
Checking/Savings Funds: 10,000\~ (I don't do a true ""savings"" account, it's just a separate linked account, no real interest earned).  
Student Loans: 6000 left, paying 200/mo. Highest interest rate is 5.8%  


Spouse Salary: 38,000 (Education Field)

Household bills (electricity, phones, subscriptions, food, etc): \~1200

&amp;#x200B;

We are pretty ""comfortable"" right now, but I don't feel like we should get too terribly comfortable. We're not in \*that\* good a position to do so, is my gut feeling. I feel like my finances are pretty much ""on track"" or better than average.  Right now, I'm thinking the plan would be to help pay down some of my Spouse's bigger debt, once we get married and accounts are joined. But, I'd like to ask for advice, to see if there are other options / things I'm not seeing. 

If there needs to be clarification / other things answered, let me know I'd be glad to help get a better picture.",finance
personalfinance,Fault by a huge CC company unnoticed for a year,"Need some input here. I was caught in a credit card debt a year back amounting to about 20K. Following which I negotiated down from a 30% interest to a 15% interest per annum. On the condition that I do not use the card any further with a promised $1000 monthly re-payment. Six months passed and the principal was not going down at the rate I calculated. Upon checking in, they mentioned that the interest rate was still locked at 30% and my card was active. I decided to let it slide at that time as I had no idea how to prove that the conversation took place.   


A year in I was dead sure about the conversation and the terms we agreed on. There was a verbal voice recorded agreement. This time I held my ground and requested to listen in to the recordings that happened during then. Within 6 hours, I got a call back claiming that there was a human error committed. They have now waived off the interest I paid for a year from the principal. However, I still do not feel the resolution is justified considering that this was found a year later. With me insisting on listening in to the voice recordings. We are to discuss this again. What should I do at this stage?

personalfinance,"How do I get a smaller student loans interest rate, and some reassurance","Hello so this is probably a common post and issue a lot of kids my age have (20F) about college but I really need some perspective and advice in terms of how I'll be able to survive with the number of loans I'm taking towards my education.

Quick facts about my situation:

1. I got accepted and enrolled in a great private school in Manhattan. I'm from a D.C. suburb
2. I'm studying International Finance
3. The total expenses taking into account room/board and financial aid is 60k a year
4. My parents can afford to pay about 30k a year
5. Both of my parents are getting their MBA's which is why they can't pay for more at this time
6. Most scholarship deadlines have passed but I plan to apply for next semester/year. My parents also earn too much to get anything needs based.
7. I really freaken love this school, and I want to live in NYC after I graduate

We tried to appeal the fafsa which gave us only $6000 in subsidised and unsubsidised loans but we learned that it actually caps out at that value. We also tried applying for private loans from our bank (Discover) which gave me a ridiculous interests rate being 12% despite my parents having 800+ credit score. Even with a good interest rate, I'll be in 90-95k+ in debt.

**My first question is why do loan companies like Discover advertise a range of 5%-12% in fixed interest? What do I have to do to get a smaller interest rate? Are there any other options I have?**

**My next question (which is pretty vague I know) is: am I going to be okay?** Realistically speaking if I do well and get a good job out of college which pays 60k-70k a year, will I be able to afford this loan. My parents may be able to help me with my loans after they graduate and I graduate but it feels like I'm gambling on my future. My parents want me to go to this school because they want me to be happy but I'm really panicking right now. I know a lot of people graduate with significantly more loans with more worthless degrees, but how screwed am I?

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't want to be convinced to leave this school or go to a local community college. I know the opportunities of being here are exponentially greater than a local school or community college and I don't want to waste my time being someplace I resent. That being said: **Is there any hope for me? What can I do to not drown?**

Thanks

***Update:*** Thanks for your thoughts. I appreciate the time all of you have taken to reply to me. I should've clarified that I'm actually an incoming sophomore transfer. I went to an instate school (25k yearly) and I left because I felt like it didn't offer me enough. I've already accepted the private school's offer of admission. I thought about it and there are really two ways this can go: I don't take the loan and stay at the instate college which I worked so hard to leave and regret it the entire time and resent myself for not taking the chance, or I take the loan and have an amazing time and education while maybe regretting it in the future. Most of you may not agree with me at all and might think this is very stupid, but I'm gonna gamble on my future. Even if I struggle the next years of my life, I'll look back and think about how amazing those years were and how much I grew. I think it's worth it. And talking to my father, he assured me that he's trying his best to move around funds and sell some shares so at best I only have maybe 60k in loans plus the lowest interest rate we can find. Money comes and goes but I don't think this opportunity will come again.",finance
personalfinance,Need some financial advice about debt.,"So I'm 33 and work as a teacher at a private school. I only make 40k a year, and I've been in debt for a while and at this point I just see the writing on the wall that I just can't really make this work anymore. I have 19.5k of credit card debt, basically across 2 credit cards. One at 15% interest APR and the other at about 14% APR. I also have one student loan (federal) for about 20k which is at about 4.5% interest which is locked in. 

Bottom line is, that I just can't save anything. I only have about 2,000 in my checking account. I tried to buckle down and save since January. I had a whole plan to try and reach 6,000 at this point and failed pretty bad. And didn't really even go crazy buying unnecessary things. I've called the credit card companies multiple times and tried to talk down interest rates, but they aren't budging. They also claim the prime rate is high at the moment and has a lot to do with my current interest rates. 

So I moved onto the next phase and looked at many companies to get a loan to consolidate all my credit debt, but the main issue I am having is that all the fixed interest rates on these loans aren't really good. Most are at 15-18%. I think at one point I had one that might have been at like 12-13%, but even that rate doesn't really make me too happy about proceeding, given that my credit card rates are pretty close to that. 

I don't have any assets or things that I can sell. I rent an apartment. I've considered opening up other credit cards and doing a bunch of balance transfers, but I'm worried about doing this because the APRS could be considerably worse after the 1-2 years and to be honest I don't think I would be able to pay off a lot of the debt by the time the 0% interest expires. I think this year alone I was only able to bring my overall credit down $700. My credit score at the moment is about 715 which is average/good at best. I've looked into other possibilities like debt consolidation companies, but to be honest I don't really hear a lot of good success stories. Sounds like it's something with a high risk to burn your credit, and a low possibility to actually clear the debt away at the end. 

I'm not sure If I'm missing anything here, but if anyone else has any ideas, I would appreciate it. In terms of career wise, I'm in a tough place. I've kind of had it with teaching. It's just such a lose lose type of job. You work in a private school with good kids and parents, and the job is reasonable and not too stressful but it comes with the burden of low pay. You go over to public school districts and there is high pay but a lot of the students/administrations are beyond stressful. I know too because I've worked in a number of them throughout my ten years of being in education. All of my worst years were in urban public school districts. 

The whole thing has kind of done a number on me. I have naturally high anxiety and don't cope well with stressful situations, I am actually medicated for it. I'll even say that I've gone so far as to contemplate filing bankruptcy if it's possible in my situation. I almost don't even care about my credit score anymore. I feel like at this point, it's just some scare to get me to fall in line and keep paying minimum payments. And to be honest, I already feel I've paid back the principal amounts as I've been paying this credit debt on and off since around 2010. At this point it's just a run away train with interest. 

So yea, there it is. Just figured at this point I'd start reaching out to communities for help because clearly this isn't going to clear itself up.",finance

personalfinance,Is taking out a personal loan a good idea for paying off credit card debt?,"Hi all, 

I’m looking for some financial advice/ guidance. 

I’m halfway through my 20’s and have found myself in more credit card debt than I would like to be in. I’m considering taking out a personal loan to pay down my cards. I’m really not sure if it’s the right thing to do. 

I’m a little over 7k in debt ( I was living on my own for quite a few years and have needed to rely on credit for lots of large purchases/ months that were tough).  

Come October I should be able to pay off roughly $1200 on my cards (money I’ll be getting back from renting deposit) 

I’m wondering if I should wait and use that to pay toward my debt, or if I should take out the loan, and put that toward the loan in October. 

My cards are all about 20% interest rate, and the loan would be about %15 interest. 

The loan would be 60 months and the calculated interest is around $3,000 over the 5 years. There is no penalty for making early payments. 

It may take me just as long to pay my cards at the rate I’m going. 

So long story short, I’m wondering if I should try to hustle and pay extra toward my cards every month, or take out the loan and hustle to pay extra toward that every month.",finance
personalfinance,"Visually impaired, how does this impact my ability to get a personal loan?","So I have been between jobs for the past few weeks and have had a crazy month in general.

First some background:

I was working at McDonald's, and the pay was great, but only because I was being coerced into working 50+ hour weeks. That location got temporarily shut down and I no longer am employed there, I was between jobs for three weeks. I start tomorrow as a hostess/server for a block of restaurants/museums in the downtown district of my city. I'm excited because I'll be making the same pay I was at McDonald's, plus crazy tips, in an energizing and healthy work environment.

However, in the last three weeks I drained my savings. Me, my boyfriend, and our two roommates just moved into a new house, which was going to make money tight, but not affect my savings. I had to pay first and last month's rent, plus the security deposit, which came out to $1200 ($400 for each).

Then I also went to my hometown last week because of a family emergency and that took a lot out of me. I'm visually impaired and don't drive but I had to pay gas money for the trip up and down (5 hours both ways) and I was paying for groceries/essentials for my family. Then my phone broke and I had to get a new phone. I'm lucky enough that my Grandma pays for my phone plan every month, but I had to pay for a new phone, case, screen protector, charger, and all the other odds and ends because my older sister had used my upgrade on our family plan. I will also be paying the $25 monthly payment on my phone.

I was going to be working for a family-friend while I was in town but she no longer needed me.

During this time I pretty much drained my savings (down to $224.00). I usually make my credit card payment in full every month but I have a balance of around $780 between two credit cards, out of my available credit line of $3000.

I know this is something that I can work through without borrowing money, but I just started establishing my own life. My family cannot help me financially in any way, my mom is in debt, and I have four sisters also in school. My mom cosigned such a crazy amount of Parent Plus loans for my older sister that her credit is further demolished, and she was denied to cosign them for her this year because of it.

My boyfriend keeps saying not to worry, together we can figure everything out, and I'm positive that he could support me where needed until I get my savings built back up.

But as someone who comes from a life below the poverty line, I'm scared of living paycheck to paycheck.

I was considering getting a $2000 loan to pay off my credit cards and establish an emergency fund, but I'm having trouble. I turn 19 in August, so the age of my accounts has been a problem, as I've only been approved for secured personal loans. Unfortunately, since I am visually impaired I do not have my own vehicle, and I don't have anyone who could cosign for me on a personal loan.

I've looked for options for visually imapired/blind people but have only found out-of-state programs (I'm in Florida).

I usually have scholarship money/federal aid money refunded to me every semester, but I am taking a semester off after being sexually assaulted at the college I just left.

personalfinance,Credit Check post-offer,"Hey all!

I’ve found many post like this, but none that can speak to my exact situation. So recently, i’ve accepted a job offer (not much money, but it was my #1 based off of the environment and such). At the same time, i was also sent the background check. Now, i am not worried about my background check as far as criminal history, but my credit isn’t the best. Coming right out of college, i am facing about 40k debt in federal student loans, and about 3k credit card debt.

What is the likelihood my offer will be rescinded?",finance
personalfinance,Should I begin saving for a down payment on a house or work on getting rid of my student loans debt?,"So I recently received a promotion at work and my salary increased roughly $12,500/yr. After good old Uncle Sam gets finished taking his share that comes out to be roughly $7,700/yr. At the moment I still have about $25,000 worth of student loan debt to pay back. That being said I would like to begin saving some money for a down payment on a house since I recently finished saving up enough for a 6 month emergency fund. 

Obviously, I think knocking out the student loans is important, but interest rates on homes are very low right now and I know that won’t last forever. My plan is to use the extra money from the raise to either begin saving for a down payment or start hitting the student loans harder. 

Which do you think would be the smarter move given the expected housing market over the next couple years?",finance

investing,Ray Dalio says gold will be a top investment during upcoming ‘paradigm shift’ for global markets,"etc etc etc...

“To me, it seems obvious that \[central banks\] have to help the debtors relative to the creditors. At the same time, it appears to me that the forces of easing behind this paradigm (i.e., interest rate cuts and quantitative easing) will have diminishing effects,” Dalio wrote.

“For these reasons, I believe that monetizations of debt and currency depreciations will eventually pick up, which will reduce the value of money and real returns for creditors and test how far creditors will let central banks go in providing negative real returns before moving into other assets.”

Dalio added that he is uncertain of the timing for the shift but he thinks “it is approaching and will have a big effect on what the next paradigm will look like.”

* because of this i don't have an emergency fund. if an emergency arose i could just put it on my credit cards and be fine.
* my students loans are $19k with interest rates ranging from 3.5-4.5%
* i have no other debt besides student loans
* my car is a 2014 with 45k miles and is quit reliable so i'm not worried about having any car issues anytime soon

personalfinance,Looking for a way to measure the cost savings of continuing to own a your current car compared to buying a new car. To be used when justifying repair costs.,"So I bought a used car a year ago. It's been great and I am absolutely in love with it. 

I want to keep it for the next 4 years if not more. 

But it's high mileage and I don't believe it will be worth anything considerable after I hit the 200k+ mark. 

So I'm in the mindset of  being the last owner of the car because any extra money I put into it... is not coming back. 

But I also try to treat it like business vehicle and maintain it religiously. I keep looking like it were an Uber car. 

But I'm trying to get a number value for how much I continue to save by driving an older car. 

I want to be able to use this value when considering pricey repair bills. If the transmission breaks tomorrow... it's $2,000 to replace...what should I do?

My paint has begun to fade and I really want to give it a new paint job.... that's $1,000.... The used marked value of the car will change minimally... But the benefit is my car once again looks brand new and I feel happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if I'm making my self clear but it's like....

Comparing the used car I bought in cash for $5,000 v.s. the $XX,xxx I could have financed....

Off the bat I saved a bunch by avoid an interest rate... higher insurance... obviously the grand total of the car...

But when taking care of a high mileage used car... at what point should I consider looking to buy a new vehicle even though I still 'like' this vehicle and am completely content.

That's the number I'm trying to find.

personalfinance,Flight School Costs,"Hey everyone, 

Here’s my situation: I want to become a pilot. I just finished paying off college and consequently have little money. In order to go to flight school I have two options. 

First, I go to something called ATP which securing outside financing is “easy” for and I complete my ratings quickly. Completing ratings quickly means I get to the airlines faster and get more money down the road. I would need a cosigner which should not be too difficult one of my parents would be willing to do so. The drawbacks of this option are the costs of training are inflated to arguably 20k$ more than other flight schools and it would be an unsecured loan so interest rate would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 8-11%, loan principal is $63,000.

The other option would be attending my local flight school where general costs would be cheaper. However, securing a loan for this would be more difficult. There are a few lenders that would offer an unsecured loan for around the same interest rate as option one. Or with proper assets I could take out a secured loan for probably closer to 2-4% interest with a principal of around $40-$50k. The other drawback to this option would be that it would take several months longer to complete training but I could hold down a part time job. 

Any insight to helping me make a decision would be greatly appreciated. 

I already have my first license if that makes a difference, I would need 2-3 more ratings depending on circumstances before I could start getting paid.",finance

personalfinance,Autoloan and interest discrepancies?,"Reposting to hopefully had this answered. 

To keep it simply I have an autoloan of 22K. Minimum payment is $497( made it a short term loan @6%?

Anyways I make $1500 payments each month to pay it off. I noticed that sometimes the interest amount fluctuates.

For example:

My first 3 payments at $1500- the interest amount was $110, 84.60, then 85.60.

After paying off more of the principal, the interest amount that was billed for the last two $1500 payments was $307 and $214. 

I thought after paying down the principal amount the interest rate will follow..? But it seems like the opposite? I have currently paid off 75% of the loan within 1 year but still notice my interest amount fluctuating drastically(100s of $) why is that?

this a non prepayment penalty loan.",finance

So, I'm a 27 year old single and for the first time in my life I'm in a situation to think about investments. I'll be able to keep aside a minimum of 4000 dollars per month. This is after all my expenses including housing, food, utilities, car payment etc

Current debts: I still have around 5000 dollars of student loan which I plan clear in the next few weeks. And I have a car worth 23k for which I paid like 4k of it at an interest rate of 5.1%(which I think is high)

My company matches 5% of pay on 401k. I assume I should put at least the same money. My pay is less than 122K which I guess makes me eligible to contribute to Roth IRA. I'm not from US and don't have a clear idea on how 401k actually works. Not sure if I should go for Roth or Traditional..

Also, I'm thinking of making weekly contributions to apps like Acorn. 

I do not see any near future expenses and I can keep these investments for 3 years at least.

gaming,A little rant about Final Fantasy XV,"It was over 10 years ago I first watched the trailer for this game and was extremely excited for this title, more so then I was excited for base Final Fantasy XIII at the time. The fantasy based on reality trailer engolfed me and left me wanting this game desperately. It looked like a mature Kingdom Hearts set in a world more vast the previous Final Fantasy games.

But time passed life went on and I played more games. I went to college, started a career, got married and had a kid. My life didn't wait for the release of this game even with the name change from Final Fantasy XIII versus to Final Fantasy XV or departing from the Fabula Novala Crystallis. Instead Final Fantasy XV was a game trapped in developement hell and not only was it difficult for me to regain the same hype I had for the game back in my high school years but with previous Final Fantasy games being somewhat disappointing I was curious whether or not it would turn out to be timeless like Final Fantasy games from my youth.

I ended up getting the game at launch from my wonderful wife who knew about the game because while we were dating I had shown her trailers for XIII Versus (go figure). But I was scared to play the game for the longest time. Was it going to be bad or good? Could a game with 10 years of hype really be lived up to?

I actually waited to play the game till around Christmas last year when finally unwrapped my Day one edition of Final Fantasy XV. 

And well I played it beat it in about 2 or 3 days and well. The game was mediocre better then XIII-2 and lightning returns most defiantly. But compared to the other games I could help but feel like it not only fell short of previous Final Fantasy games but it is probably my least favorite JRPG I've played this generation. 

This may be just me but Final Fantasy XV was better in my imagination and Final Fantasy XIII Versus. I am glad I no longer have the desire to know what could have been but it ia almost sad after 10 years a game that I feel is somewhat mediocre could have been so great.",technology
CryptoCurrency,Visa and MasterCard may leave the Russian market,"International payment systems Visa and MasterCard may stop working on the territory of the Russian Federation if the State Duma approves amendments to the law “On the National Payment System”, which will be considered at the end of this month, Kommersant reports.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bank of Russia said that the adoption of the amendments does not threaten the work of international payment systems in the territory of the Russian Federation. Visa representatives said that they would continue to provide uninterrupted non-cash payments in the country.

&amp;#x200B;

In particular, these are amendments that provide for a ban on subsidiaries of international payment systems in Russia to suspend settlements on bank cards at their own discretion. For example, when it comes to financial organizations subject to international sanctions.

Currently, the register of operators of payment systems of the Central Bank consists of subsidiaries of such companies as Visa, MasterCard, China Union Pay, JCB and others.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, according to experts, for such international systems to bring the rules into line with the requirements of the Russian authorities is simply impossible and, most likely, this will lead to the departure of such companies from the Russian market.

&amp;#x200B;

In this regard, many bank account holders, who still need to pay abroad, can turn to cryptocurrencies and bitcoin, some experts say.

worldpolitics,Yes she married her brother for immigration purposes! 🤮 (Alt Left Snopes never really asked),"Minnesota state Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-60B) currently leads the race to fill the federal House seat being vacated by Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN). Immediately after being elected to her current seat in 2016, Omar faced allegations -- soon backed by a remarkable amount of evidence -- that she had married her own brother in 2009, and was still legally his wife. They officially divorced in December 2017.

The motivation for the marriage remains unclear. However, the totality of the evidence points to possible immigration fraud and student loan fraud.

Rep. Omar has stated that she did marry ""British citizen"" Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in 2009, though the allegation that he is her brother is ""absurd and offensive.""

Below, exclusive new evidence -- from official archived high school records and corroborating sources -- strongly supports the claim that Ahmed Nur Said Elmi is indeed her brother.

As this implicates Rep. Omar in multiple state and federal felonies, I have contacted the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Minnesota to submit all other information uncovered during our investigation.

---------------------

According to official student enrollment records archived by St. Paul Public Schools and the state of Minnesota, an “Ahmed N. Elmi” was enrolled as a senior in the Class of 2003 at Arlington Senior High School in St. Paul, MN, from September 6, 2002, until June 10, 2003. He graduated and received a diploma.

The enrollment record states that “Ahmed N. Elmi” was born on April 4, 1985.

Both Ilhan Omar’s 2009 marriage documents and her 2017 divorce proceedings state that Ahmed Nur Said Elmi was born on April 4, 1985.

After an extensive background search, I have not been able to find any other person named “Ahmed Nur Said Elmi,” “Ahmed N. Elmi,” or even “Ahmed Elmi” with the birthdate April 4, 1985. The man Ilhan Omar married and the 17- to 18-year-old who attended Arlington Senior High School in St. Paul, MN, in 2002-2003 are one and the same.

Pa. Dem Candidate Snaps, Drops F-Bomb at GOP Opponent During Debate in SYNAGOGUE
Ahmed N. Elmi was a minor for most of the school year, and thus his parent(s)/legal guardian(s) would very likely also be listed on his enrollment records -- along with his home address and telephone number.

St. Paul Public Schools stated to me that federal law (FERPA) and Minnesota law forbid it from releasing the names of Ahmed N. Elmi’s parents/legal guardians, address, or phone number from his enrollment record without Elmi’s signed permission -- or a warrant.

I then contacted several members of the Class of 2003 -- and I was told that Eli “was living with his father” while attending Arlington Senior High School. I have also obtained the likely address.

Further, Elmi’s father was identified as the same man Ilhan Omar has always publicly referred to as her own father: Nur Said Elmi Mohamed. (Read about Somali naming tradition here.)

Here is his Facebook account, where he refers to himself as Nur Said.

-------------------------

On Friday (October 19), I emailed Rep. Ilhan Omar, the MN Democratic Party (DFL) chairman, and the MN DFL CD-5 chairman to request comment. I asked for a response by Monday evening -- a full three days. I also sent a follow-up email to all three on Monday afternoon:



No one responded.

This was not unexpected. Rep. Omar did not respond to a three-day deadline before I published an article covering her on August 8, 2018. That article presented documented evidence that Omar appeared to commit perjury multiple times during her 2017 divorce proceedings.

However, perhaps this tweet posted last night from Rep. Omar’s official Twitter account was an indirect response:

https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1054576234666123264

If so, I’d suggest the evidence against her stands on its own. I would also ask her to produce a single instance of false content, or “propaganda,” that I have published in my three articles covering her background.

I will publish a fourth article later this week.

I ask this because my parents lost coverage in December-March 2019 because my mom was working 20hr a week and the person she talked to only looked at my parents’ paystubs for the 2 most recent months.  
Now my mom is back to working 10 hr. a week and qualified for Medicaid.

Banking,Challenges for Cannabis and Banking: Outside Perspectives,"For the second time this month, the Cannabis Trade Federation will be representing the cannabis industry in Congress! This time, the chair of CTF’s Board of Directors — John Lord, CEO of LivWell Enlightened Health — has been invited to testify before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. 

With momentum building behind the SAFE Banking Act (H.R.1595 / S.1200), Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) will be holding a hearing titled, “Challenges for Cannabis and Banking: Outside Perspectives,"" on Tuesday, July 23, at 10:00 a.m. ET. The purpose of the hearing is to solicit testimony from a variety of stakeholders, including bank and credit union officials. John’s testimony will focus on his experience as the operator of a vertically-integrated cannabis company in Colorado, which has grown from a single store and cultivation facility in 2010 to more than 650 employees and roughly $100 million in annual revenue today.

It was just one week ago that I testified before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, during a hearing focused broadly on the need for reform of cannabis laws at the federal level. It is quite an honor for CTF to be selected to testify at a congressional hearing. It is even more impressive — and a testament to the commitment of our board and the work of our staff and lobbyists — to be selected to do so twice, especially in such a short amount of time.

If you are interested in watching the hearing, you can visit the hearing page on the Senate Banking Committee website next Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. ET. Note that John will appear on the second panel. The first panel will feature Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR).

personalfinance,Savings Account help,"Here's the rub. I'm looking into opening a savings account with my current banking establishment, 5/3.

personalfinance,"Opened useless lines of credit as a college student, any suggestions on where to go from here?","So I am a 26 year old who opened a couple of stupid lines of credit at the age of 18-21. What should I do now?
I opened a Banana Republic VISA due to that being the majority of my wardrobe at the time, and a SEARS CITI MasterCard when furnishing my first house in college. I have now had both of those lines of credit open for 7-8 years. After spending like an idiot in college I opened two additional accounts for low APR balance transfers after racking up some debt on my BR VISA and Sears MasterCard about 5ish years ago. The accounts I opened were Chase Slate and a Bank of America BankAmericard. I was managing with those 4 credit lines but was never able to really pay them off completely so I was paying high interest rates and really saw no rewards from any of the 4 cards. I was able to pay down all 4 cards (combined total of $48,000 limit) and then bought a house in the last year once my credit score was in the mid 750’s. I got myself into credit trouble again for a few months after making the same mistake and refurnishing a new house but have been able to pay off the cards once again. Now to my question... I don’t really care for any of my cards (no rewards)/would trade any of them in for better offers, if I could. Do I balance transfer (effectively $0, or whatever the minimum is) to a new credit line with a rewards card? Will that lose the amount of time I’ve had an open line of credit or does it rollover with a balance transfer? Do they even offer first year/3 month bonus rewards for balance transfers or does it have to be a completely new credit line (this may depend on the card/lender)? Should I just apply for an additional (5th) credit card and just keep the old ones until canceling one or more of them won’t negatively affect my score/credit history length?
One other thing is that I’ve had 3 hard credit checks in the last 2 years so I’m not sure how detrimental an additional check would be if I were to apply to a new credit card or if I wanted to refinance my mortgage if a lower rate came along. 
I’ve learned a lot since opening my first couple lines of credit but still need to work on my spending in general. Just feels like my current cards are a waste without getting and travel points or cash back on purchases. 

Thank you for any suggestions!",finance
personalfinance,Tuition Tax Credit Audit,"I need some advice on a State Tax Audit I just received in the mail. They are specifically auditing the education tax credit portion from my 2016 taxes. Here is a background on all my education history.

Graduated highschool in 2011 and immediately started college that Fall at a 4 year university. I was full time and received state and school scholarships which covered all expenses. From 2012-2013, I transferred and attended a 2 year community school full time in which I received state scholarships which paid for most of my school but the rest were paid in loans. From 2013-2014, I transferred again and attended another 4 year school full time. I received both school and state scholarships and I had to pay a small amount in loans. From 2014-2017, I again transferred (I know I know) back to the same 2 year community college as previous. From 2014-2015, I was part time a received state scholarship and covered the rest with loans. From 2015-2017, I was full time and received zero grants/scholarships and paid all of school with federal loans. I graduated in 2017 with an Associates degree in Respiratory Therapy.

Like I mentioned earlier the audit is against my 2016 taxes. At that time I was in school full time and not receiving any sort of financial aid. I paid for all of my school with loans and had a 1098-T form that I used to fill out my taxes. I'm going to be honest- I'm not sure if I was eligible for the tax credit or not. I did file independently, as I wasn't living with my parents. I was young at the time and filing on my own using HRBlock EFile tool. I kinda just flew through it and typed in stuff I was asked to type in.

The state is asking for my highschool diploma, all college transcripts, my 1098-T form from that year, and a copy of a fee payment history proving I did not receive any scholarships or grants (which I believe is listed on the 1098-T form).

&amp;#x200B;

First question- is this something I should get professional help with or is this simple enough to complete on my own?

Second- based on the info I provided, does anyone with better knowledge of taxes and credits know if I was actually eligible or not?

Third- if it turns out I was not eligible, what happens? I assume I pay back the credit I was given, but is there a penalty as well?

Fourth- just any general advice going forward? I have never been audited and no clue how to handle it, who to talk to, etc.

solar,Install Starting Soon - My Final Prices and Thoughts,"What a ride.  3 times I had to call 3 different installers and let them I was going with their competitor. Every time the price, warranty, and offer changed and the cycle restarted.  I've never experienced that before.  Every few days I thought I had the best price and it couldn't get any lower, what an insane journey.  Literally like buying a used car.  In the end though I am very happy.  All 3 installers were very aggressive with their pricing, though two were much more transparent with a number up front.

|$26,700|11.025 kW|14,820 kWh|$2.42|35|Q.PEAK DUO BLK-G5 315|SolarEdge SE 10000H-US|

25 year manufacturers warranty on the inverter  
15 year roof/workmanship warranty  
25 year performance warranty

I also got one really simple thing that meant alot - the installer will be painting the conduit on my house to match my brick, coordinating with me the conduit run, and installing the inverter inside my garage so it doesn't look terrible on the outside.

In the end It has about a 7 year payback after federal (30%) and duke ($6,000) rebates.  I'm super stoked.  Should be installed in the next 2-3 weeks.",energy

Purpose:

Client want to borrow money to pay off the Judgement. Traditional lender have declined request, hence, in a catch 22. Client can’t borrow money to pay off judgement nor able to borrow new fund.

personalfinance,Advice on Budgeting for the Long-Term,"Two events just prompted me to revisit my short-term and long-term financial goals. The first is, after committing to a school and signing a lease, I decided to abandon my plans to attend law school, largely because I didn't think taking on a $150,000 debt load was worth pursuing a career I'm only half interest in (my parents were really the ones pushing me to do it...). I also just received a raise, albeit a very small one. 

&amp;#x200B;

In any event, I was hoping y'all could take a look at my current financial situation and provide some feedback on what you think I should do going forward. I want to get ahead on my long-term financial outlook now because my parents were never all that responsible with money, and I've watched them go through periods of financial distress because of their past mistakes. 

&amp;#x200B;

First, my goals: I want to invest more because I know that the interest from my credit union will, in the long-run, be outpaced by inflation. Was thinking of opening an index fund account and putting a lump sum of $2500 to start, just as a way to get my feet wet in the investment world. However, I also know that my high-interest student loan debt is an issue. A mix of investing and paying down debt would be ideal. I'd also like to buy a used car in cash when my current one is paid off (more info below). Nothing fancy, but I do love Subaru Foresters. Other than that, I will be going back to school at some point in the next couple of years, so I'd like to continue saving some money for that. Finally, I like to budget travel and want to make it a yearly thing (I just came back from 2 weeks in Europe and loved it). 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what my situation currently looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23M, graduated from college last year, and currently live with my parents, meaning my monthly expenses are quite low. 

&amp;#x200B;

I make **$41,400/year** before taxes, which boils down to roughly **$2268/month** after taxes. I also work four nights a week at a restaurant during the summer, and by the end of the season will probably have made an extra $10,000 in tips (before taxes). Normally, I don't factor that into my monthly budget, which, I think, helps keep me financially responsible (feel free to push back).

&amp;#x200B;

As of recently, I'm contributing about 9.5% of gross income toward a 457b plan, which includes a 1% employer match. I have about **$1800** saved in this account. I also automatically put 15% of my paycheck into a credit union account, which has an average APR of 1.77%. I was putting 20% when I thought I was going to school, but I recently--as in today--cut back on this to 15%. I have about **$11,000** saved in this account. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where I'm concerned. My debt load looks like this:

**Student Loans** ($43,404 total): 

Federal Loans: $29,953 with interest of 4.27%

Private Loans: $13,451 with an average interest of--wait for it--10.96%

**Car Loan** (my parents pay this normally, though I will contribute when they ask):

$4500 with about 2 years left and interest rate of 2.1%

**Credit Cards**

$200, which I'm hoping to pay off by the end of the month

&amp;#x200B;

My monthly expenses are:

Cell Phone - $40 for a prepaid plan, $55 for a financed phone (figured what the hell) at 0% interest

Gym - $21

Student Loans - $350, though I will pay more when I have extra money

Transportation - $300 (I work about an hour from home)

Me and my S.O are looking at buying a house together, and I’m trying to see if our timeline is reasonable. 

About us : 

Teacher - making 46k this year, contract for next year will be 52k after finishing an accreditation. 
Self employed - making about 1.5k a month on average, actively looking for a full time job that will pay 30-40k. 

So in the next 12 months, we expect to bring in somewhere between 65k and 80k with an increase starting next August. 

We owe 16k on a car and 4.5k on a student loan. Both have interest rates around 3.5%. The other car is paid off. 

Our current rent is roughly 850 after utilities 

Car insurance is $250 a month 

Health insurance is $200 a month for both of us. 

We have 10k in savings right now and will be able to put away a substantial amount between now and when we buy a house. 

We plan on staying in the area for at least 6 more years from now due to teaching contract timelines. 

Both of our credit scores are over 700. 

Timeline - 

Our lease will be up in November of next year, so November 2020. We’d like to buy a house then. 

Our market - 

Austin TX, housing values have been trending about 4% up every year, if not more in some areas. 
We’re looking for about 1200-1600 sq ft and a price range between 220k and 280k.

personalfinance,Question about loan payoff strategy,"For reasons that don't particularly matter (except to say it won't happen again), I have a personal loan from Upstart with the following metrics:

* $12,500 principal
* APR of 19.09% (also says 15.49% per annum simple interest on the promissory note so I am not sure which is more relevant)
* $300.60 minimum monthly payment
* Payment schedule of 60 months beginning September 2018 and ending August 2023

&amp;#x200B;

I currently pay $500.60 per month broken up over a biweekly paycheck. To date, I have paid $3,963.87 toward the principal and $5,503.60 total. At the current rate, I anticipate my last payment to be November 2020 (17 months) - though I am not accounting for accrued interest; at worst, this could add one or two months (not worried about it). As of today, the loan payoff amount is $8,572.36 but this will vary the longer I wait to make a decision. Yes, the principal will decrease but it does accrue a small amount of interest each month.

&amp;#x200B;

I am unsure of how much interest I am accruing per month. The approval disclosure suggests I will have paid $18,038.41 total following the amortization schedule, but I am paid ahead and will continue to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have $10,766.83 in high-yield savings (current interest rate of 2.12%, current APY of 2.15%). **Should I take money out of savings to pay off the loan ASAP?** I would have $2,194.47 remaining plus a $1,000.00 emergency fund and a reliable income. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some things to consider: 

* I currently put $500.00 per month away in savings. If I no longer make my monthly debt payment of $500.60, that total will be $1,000.60 per month and I can recoup the amount of the loan payoff in fewer than 9 months.

* There is no penalty for paying off the loan early.
* My credit score is currently a 740-748 depending on the bureau. The account will close once the loan is paid off, but my overall debt balance will decrease (let's forget about my $80,000 in federal student loans for the time being). I am not sure how this will impact my credit score.
* I am trying to buy a house in Q1 or Q2 2021 - though I live in one of the toughest housing markets in my state and it may or may not take a steep plunge before then. I would be a first-time homebuyer and absolutely plan to apply for the appropriate FHA loans.

With the amount of money they released, their QT has not been helping in reducing the effects of the money printed.

personalfinance,Best path to go regarding credit card debt,"So I'm not as smart or good with money and managing debt like the rest of y'all so I have a simple question I'm hoping y'all might help me in.

  So I've accrued a decent amount of debt through credit cards and other ventures but I also have a fair to good score. A lot of companies won't accept unless you're on the higher end of good or excellent which to me is counter-intuitive. I've read about debt consolidation but that most of the time leads to high interest rates that won't really fare well with my other expenses. I've also read about Dave Ramsay's advice on debt snowballing and other tools but that also requires putting extra money into this debt which can prove challenging if already strapped for dinero. So basically I'm asking what's the best course of action for managing debt and get you back on your feet. Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,"10k in credit card debt, paying $700 a month to keep my credit cards up to date, can't get approved for a personal loan to pay a lower amount each month","Obligatory ""I know I shouldn't have this many credit cards""

&amp;#x200B;

Currently sitting in about 10k in credit card debt that's spread across several cards.  Trying to get the balance paid down but having to pay $100 here, $100 there, $300 over there to try and pay them down quicker.  Thought it may be a good idea to try and get a personal loan to cover the credit card debt and just pay a lower monthly payment with a lower interest rate than all my cards.  The banks don't see it that i'd be paying less on a personal loan than I am currently paying monthly for my credit cards.  They see it as I have too much debt to income and won't approve me.  I've tried a local credit union (South Dakota, USA), and I've tried an online loan site like OneMain to no avail.  I thought for sure OneMain would approve me considering I get their mailers all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I have some other money that's coming in monthly now that will help (Lyft/Uber), but it will hardly scratch the surface of what I need to pay to get these things paid off quicker.  I'm not drowning, I've stayed up to date with my payments and haven't missed a payment on any cards since 2016, and I feel like I'm in a better financial situation now than I was a year ago...yet I can't get approved for a personal loan to take care of it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a snapshot of my finances per Credit Karma:

Credit Cards **$10,084**

No Collections

Student Loans **$29,949** (Currently on IDR, $70/month)

Other Loans**$6,181** (2 personal loans, one is paid for after this month, frees up $93/month)

Auto Loans **$18,914** (have never missed a payment, monthly payment $484, no interest loan, $110/mo car insurance)

Rent **$885**/month

Current Credit Scores (per CK) 646/647

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel because my car will be paid off in just over 3 years, and my personal loan that I have will be paid off in just under 2 years and I'm basically going to debt snowball once they're paid off. But I'm trying to find a solution sooner than that and the banks don't seem to care that I'm paying $700-1000 per month to keep my credit cards somewhat low.

Trading,"Trade Worries Resurface, Stocks End Lower","The S&amp;P 500 index concludes its Wednesday with lower stock prices, ending the day with a 0.7% decrease. What most likely caused this shift, which has now occurred two days in a row, are the trade worries that have risen back up once again. As stated by Revinitiv, this Wednesday has become the least favorable one-day percentage drop for the index in the past three weeks.

On Tuesday, U.S President Donald Trump stated during a cabinet meeting that it is possible for him to urge additional issuance of tariffs on goods from China. The past month, during the G20 summit in Japan, both economies agreed on a trade truce. This caused the uneasiness concerning the trade war to subside temporarily. But now, the tension has risen its ugly head. At this point, investors are analyzing how this reemerged trade uncertainty will match up against the likelihood of a rate cut being announced by the Federal Reserve in two weeks.

Mark McCormick, the global head of FX strategy at TD Securities stated that the market is currently struggling with additional news regarding the trade situation, and as a consequence most risky assets gradually move lower. Meanwhile, in the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, the U.S economy was depicted as a moderately growing economy.

personalfinance,Mortgage lender offering lower interest rate for a 10% down payment than for a 20% down payment,"Hi all!

I just had an offer accepted for a home. We got pre-approved through a big, online lender, but we’ve been shopping around with our realtor’s local, preferred lenders (who seem really knowledgeable and helpful). 

I was planning on putting down 20%, but one lender suggested putting down 10% and paying a chunk of the interest up front. In the 10% down scenario he proposed, the interest rate was, counterintuitively, significantly lower than the 20% down scenario. Over the lifetime of the loan, we would actually spend less on the 10% down scenario. This was really fishy to me, but the lender’s reasoning seemed sound:

At less than 20% down, we would be subject to private mortgage insurance. The PMI would significantly decrease the bank’s exposure to risk, resulting in the lower interest rate. 

I’ve never heard anything like this. During our chat, I googled such a scenario and couldn’t really find anything corroborating his perspective, however, the documents he shared with me seemed to back him up. 

Having the extra cash in hand will definitely be helpful. I’ll have enough for an emergency fund plus enough to furnish the place. I’ll be able to aggressively pay down the mortgage and quickly lift the PMI. 

Is this too good to be true? It seems like there’s no downside other than a marginally higher total monthly payment.

Thanks in advance for your help!",finance

personalfinance,Having trouble deciding what route to take,"We currently have 3 vehicles and only 2 drivers. We have a 2008 Edge ($170 biwk at 15% $10.5k left), a 2012 F150 ($475/mth at 10%, $9k left)  and a 2018 Explorer ($650/mth at 0.8%, $40k left).

The edge was bought several years ago when I had sub 590 credit. Current credit score around 680-700. Income over $100k/yr.

Here's the problem.  We don't want the Edge. 

Here are the things we've thought about doing;

First route, my parents actually want the F150. We've contemplated letting them pay us for it instead. We would pay off the $9k and we would just carry the note at the current payment amount for the rest of the term. Currently about 2.5 yrs left. I still want a truck though, so we would trade the Edge in on a new truck (to cover the negative equity) on a note about $50k with, ostensibly, a way lower interest rate. But our total debt goes way up. Parents payment would cover part of the new truck payment. 

Second, I pay off the truck and keep it. Pay off the Edge and sell it for a loss. Or just keep it. 

Considerations, I work in the oil field and layoffs happen routinely. With the push for electric vehicles I expect my job to last maybe another 5 years before the industry becomes untenable. Regardless, we have a 5 year plan for me to get a job outside of the oilfield. New salary will likely be considerably less, estimating around $75k Including the vehicles monthly expenditures of around $6k. 

We for sure want to get rid of the edge. what's the best approach?",finance
Bitcoin,"[serious] What if Bitcoin ""Reward"" system was Less to more (doubled, instead of halfed)","Note: First time poster on this subreddit and mobile so sorry for bad format.

Hello /r/bitcoin so I've had a weried thought about the reward system for mining. 

As most know how bitcoin is setup for mining is rewarded with bitcoin after so many blocks, and that every 4 years the amount you can receive is halfed. (50-&gt;25,etc) 

So my question is what would be different if bitcoin ""reward"" system was made instead, start at the amount at lowest and double (instead of halving) every 4 years untill completely mined? Do you think people would still have mined at the start of bitcoin or wait it out? If a /r/cryptocurrency came out like this (that was legit and good) would you mine it at start or wait few years?

I’m 33, am 100% vested in the pension plan, and it sits at $52k right now. As I understand how a pension works, my average salary and years of service with that company are fixed numbers forever. I had 10.33 years of service and the average salary for my last 5 years was around $105k. If I started the monthly payout now, it would be $200/month. If I waited until I turn 65, it would be around $750/month. I called to confirm what my options are with this account, and I can also rollover the money into an IRA or similar, or take a lump sum payment. The lump sum would get taxed at 20% federal, plus ~4-5% for state, plus a 10% early withdrawal penalty that would get assessed when I file my taxes in 2020. This results in a lump sum of about $34k. That number sounds great, but then when I do the math on the monthly payout, either starting now, or at 65....in both scenarios let’s go to age 80....that’s a total of $112,800, taking $200/month starting now, or $135,000, taking the $750/month when I turn 65. 

What am I missing? $112k / $135k does not equal $52k. The lump sum sounded great to have now and invest...until I did the math on the monthly payout scenarios. 

The way I see it, this money will get taxed the ~24-25% regardless of if I touch it now or wait til later in life. The 10% penalty isn’t ideal, but with smart investing, I could make up that amount lost and then some. But what am I not realizing or don’t know about how pensions work?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Does Taking A Loan Make Sense?,"Note: I am not in the US, Canada, UK or Australia. Amounts are in my local currency. Inflation here is currently above 100% so I am not putting any money into savings beyond what is deducted at work for pensions.

&amp;#x200B;

Background Information:

My husband and I earn a total of  $3,000 a month. Our monthly expenses currently add up to $1,600. The rest of our income is put towards construction material and labour (more on that below). As said above, we have no interest in saving our income right now since we live in a hyper-inflationary economy.

&amp;#x200B;

The Situation:

We bought a piece of land in the town I live in and owe just under $6,000 on it. This is the only debt we have. We paid a deposit of $6,000, and have paid another +/-$7,000 in installments. The cost on acquisition was $19,000. The loan was a 10 year one, and we have had it for a year. This is for building our home, and we have made a little progress in construction. Our current estimation is we need about $50,000 - $100,000 to have the house ready for living in. We have bought some material and we are stockpiling it. My husband's salary is dedicated to capital projects like this, while mine is for recurring expenses. When we get bonuses at work, we put in that money either into paying off our loan on the land, or into construction. We also have some foreign currency saved that is going to be put into construction as well. However, our bank is offering us a loan with interest at 17%/annum. We feel very tempted to take since:

&amp;#x200B;

1. We can really push through with building and move into our house ASAP
2. Inflation rate is higher than interest rate, so we will be OK in terms of repayment
3. We can always change our foreign currency into local currency using arbitrage for paying back the loan, especially since our local currency is losing value rapidly

&amp;#x200B;

However, we are not big on taking on debt, as evidenced by our aggressive repayment schedule on the loan for the land. Do you think taking on such a loan in this economic situation makes sense? I would really appreciate some input on our financial situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!!!

personalfinance,Massive Student Loan Advice,"Hello Redditors.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for some advice/insight/experiences from anyone out here that's had to deal with the situation of massive student loan debt that seem impossible to get out from under.

First off I'm not the person with the debt, it's someone close to me that's having a personal crisis with a $350,000 debt on an undergrad and veterinary medical degree. I would also like to avoid any comments from people calling them an idiot or ""it's their own fault"". At this point they are well aware of this and quite honestly it's driven them to the brink of suicide at times.

Their monthly payments are +$4000 a month, with the majority of their repayments going towards the interest and only a little over $1000 a month eating away at the principle. The job that they currently have affords them the ability to keep up with the payments but it also means that they are pretty much stuck doing that specific job which itself is taking it's toll on them mentally as it's quite grim. There doesn't seem to be many other options as far as making that level of income.

As far as I know it's a federal loan with an interest rate of around 7%. I'm no finance guru (hence the reason I'm posting here) so the numbers may be off a little but this is the general situation. I'd really love any insight that people have as to ways in which you can approach this issue so there may be a little light at the end of the tunnel and they don't have to feel like they will be locked into a life of overnight shifts and retiring with debt.

Again, this person is very close to me and I would appreciate some constructive input rather than reiterating what we already know. But hey, this is Reddit.....

Thanks in advance for you time.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Payoff Strategy,"Hi all,

I posted a few months ago about wanting to pay off a chunk of my student loans, and I've done just that this week, paying off my three biggest federal student loans ($13,634 out of $19,732). The remaining federal loans are at 3.4% interest, totaling $6,147) My liquid savings (not including 401k) were at $28,900, and they're now about $15,000 (including $10K emergency fund), in a 2.1% savings account.

My question is, am I better off paying off the remaining $6k loan balance right now, depleting my savings/emergency fund to $9K, or should I keep that extra $5k liquid and just make bulk $1K payments as they come in (my savings rate per month is about $1k). It's tempting to just want to be done with the loans period, but I don't want to be brash either.

Thanks!

Q lives off social security from when she was a shrink.  She once had an IRA but tapped it for poorly done bathroom remodel job and some living expenses.  

Q lives of her SS, barely squeaking by, as it barely covers living expenses and food.  She has several credit cards that are maxed out, but have lower interest rates.

Q has tenants occasionally, rents adding another $10k a year.  However, she doesn’t use the money to pay off her credit cards, instead it goes to pay for junk to make herself feel better (like buying a cheesecake to give to someone who is allergic to dairy). 

Last night she asked me what she should do with the money, because I am “smart in those things”.  Her biggest worry is that the IRS will get their hands on it (most of the $ is from the sale of a house).

Ripple,Idea for New York,"I am a Ripple holder and believer in the project, and I live in New York State. It occurred to me that on the state level there is no energy  spent towards ripple and general blockchain acceptance. I have a good deal of experience with both working and understanding how the government of New York functions, and there are several potential avenues for Ripple to get involved and make a difference.

My first idea, is that Ripple should work with the SUNY and CUNY schools on a public private partnership for general blockchain education. New York State offers a very robust public collegiate system that so far has been untapped for blockchain. A great way to make inroads in New York, is to engage the education system and work with colleges to offer blockchain based education. Doing this would both help garner general acceptance of blockchain as a legitimate enterprise while also helping those in the State education system by exposing them to this technology.

Secondly, as far as I know there is not any kind of lobbying group in New York for blockchain. This presents a great opportunity to either secure state funding, or at the very least engage with legislators so that they can understand and learn to accept blockchain as legitimate. 

If anyone has paid attention, it seems that the perception of politicians is that blockchain is mostly used for illicit purposes, and it is time to bury that half haphazard theory by engaging with both state and federal regulators to make them understand that blockchain and especially Ripple are completely separate from that world.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Is it possible to convert a family loan into a mortgage?,"My parents have offered to lend us money to buy a house. We'll still be paying near-market interest rates; this just keeps the money in the family instead of paying it to a bank.

&amp;#x200B;

We're trying to decide whether to actually make the loan a mortgage (i.e., with a lien) or just a personal loan.

&amp;#x200B;

If I understand correctly, the benefits of making it a mortgage are:

1. It's secured so if I decide not to pay my parents back they have legal recourse to my house
2. I can deduct the interest on my taxes

&amp;#x200B;

I have a great relationship with my parents and they don't care about having the loan secured, and now that standard deductions are so high, I think it's unlikely that I'll be able to deduct the interest. So, I'm tempted to just do a personal loan and avoid the (admittedly fairly minor) hassle of formalizing the loan as a mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Am I missing other good reasons to do a mortgage instead of a personal loan?

I want to preface this by saying that I understand those who have a moral objection to investing in tobacco. I'm trying to write about this purely from an investment standpoint. 

The stock dipped earlier this year and is now trading at a price similar to when my previous post was made while the rest of the market has gone up by roughly 20%. What's changed since then is the JUUL stake. This has doubled the Net Debt/EBITDA to 2.7 and halved the interest coverage ratio to \~7. I wouldn't call this a fortress balance sheet anymore, but I think the debt is manageable. 

MO currently has a market cap of $95B and one share trades for approx $50. 

&amp;#x200B;

**AbInBev** 

BUD currently has a market cap of $160B and accounts for roughly one in three beers sold across the world everyday. MO owns 10% of BUD, which means $16 billion of MO's market cap is their stake in BUD. While I'm not a fan of 3G's management style (KHC has turned out to be a mess), I do think they know what they're doing when it comes to the beer business. BUD is up 45% ytd compared to SPYs 20%. Management is taking steps to clean up their [balance sheet](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-19/ab-inbev-sells-australia-unit-to-asahi-still-weighing-asia-ipo) after their acquisition of SABMiller.

[Here's](https://www.amazon.com/Dethroning-King-Takeover-Anheuser-Busch-American-ebook/dp/B005UQLEJ0) a book that goes over their takeover of Anheuser Busch. 3Gs initial investment of $50 million into [Companhia Cervejaria Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companhia_Cervejaria_Brahma) in 1989 is worth approximately $40 billion in their BUD stake today. While I think their management style is too aggressive for my comfort, I'm perfectly fine with MO just holding their BUD stake and collecting the dividends. MO initially purchased Miller Brewing Company for $300 million in 1970. Today it's worth $16 billion through their BUD stake. They receive approx $550 million a year in dividends from BUD **after** the dividend cut. I don't expect people to stop drinking beer anytime soon, so even with little to no growth, this investment will continue to add cash to shareholders pockets for decades to come. 

&amp;#x200B;

**JUUL**

MO paid $13 billion for their 35% stake in JUUL. At the time of the purchase, MO valued JUUL at roughly 36x sales ($38 billion for the entire company), which seems very expensive. Here are my thoughts on the matter

\- MO had to admit defeat in the vaping space. Their vape products were getting crushed by JUUL and cigarette smokers were switching over as well. I think it was smart of management to stop fighting a losing battle and just use their balance sheet to team up with the winners instead. [It reminds me of a time when RIM didn't think AAPL was a threat.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rim-iphone/rim-co-ceo-doesnt-see-threat-from-apples-iphone-idUSN1236561320070212) Where would blackberry shareholders be today if RIM had decided to buy 35% of AAPL in 2007? 

\- MO had an insight into JUULs growth trajectory [because they invested in a vape shop roughly a year before announcing their JUUL stake](https://www.richmond.com/business/local/altria-makes-a-minority-investment-in-a-rapidly-growing-chesterfield/article_4bf5caa8-0514-5936-87e3-e88f20d2c814.html). 

\- JUUL realized their advantageous position when their biggest competitor came to them looking to team up. This allowed them to command a hefty premium.

\- [Sales grew 23% from Q12018 to Q12019 and showed strong international growth](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-11/juul-tells-investors-sales-are-climbing-again-despite-flavor-pullback).

It's hard to tell if the $13 billion price tag was justified, but I think it was a smart move from MO to hedge their bets while they could still afford to do it. [There's been rumors that JUUL is now valued at $50 billion](https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/juul-e-cigarette-maker-sees-its-valuation-top-38b/), so we'll assume $13 billion was a reasonable price to pay for the 35% stake. So $13 billion of the $95 billion is their stake in JUUL.

&amp;#x200B;

**CRON**

MO also paid approx $2 billion for their 45% stake in CRON with warrants to up their stake to 55%. I don't follow the marijuana industry closely and I think it's too early to predict where CRON will be 20 years from now. I think the emphasis  for the company will be on cannabinoid extracts to be used in vapes, edibles etc. For what it's worth, I think MO is probably best suited to roll out marijuana products on a large scale when we see legalization at a federal level. They have a pretty lucrative tobacco business, extensive experience dealing with US lawmakers and an established relationship with retailers. So $2 billion of the $95 billion is their stake in CRON.

&amp;#x200B;

**Philip Morris USA, US Smokeless Tobacco and the rest**

These are the wholly owned businesses that manufacture cigarettes, chewing tobacco, snus, cigars etc. These businesses account for all of the cash flow provided by operations on the balance sheet. Taking out the equity holdings mentioned above from the market cap puts the value of these businesses at approx $64 billion. 

\- Cigarette volumes have been declining at a faster rate than previously expected. Smokeable volumes declined [by 7%](http://investor.altria.com/Cache/1001251868.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1001251868&amp;iid=4087349) compared to Q12018 as opposed to 4% as most analysts had predicted. 

\- MO's smokeless tobacco unit has shown growth in the past and is [poised to show growth over the next 5 years.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/07/09/how-much-could-altrias-smokeless-products-division-grow-over-the-next-5-years/#44ce80c76f7a)

\- IQOS has been approved in the US which will offset some of the declines in cigarette volumes. 

\- TTM free cash flow from aforementioned operations is approx $7.7 billion of which $5.6 billion were paid in dividends. Keep in mind MO targets a payout of approx 80% of earnings in dividends.  

This gives us a current free cash flow yield of approx 11% for the operating business as of today. This is a rough estimate of what the shareholders are paying for because this is money that goes towards paying dividends, paying off debt, buying back shares or making acquisitions. 

Some rough back of the envelope math tells us that assuming the cash flows show no growth and stay stable through price hikes and cost cutting at roughly $7.5 billion, we get our initial investment back in approx 10 years and anything following that is free money. If it declines at 7-8% a year, it'll take approx 20 years before the operating businesses reach 0 and we are left with the equity holdings for BUD, JUUL and CRON. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks to consider** 

Here are some risks to keep in mind

\-  [Cigarette volumes decline at a double digit rate.](https://www.cspdailynews.com/tobacco/cigarette-volume-down-115-nielsen-says)

\- More regulations/lawsuits against e-cigs if teen vaping isn't brought under control

\- CRON and/or JUUL investments turn out to be duds and lose market share to competitors. 

\- IQOS doesn't gain traction in the US. 

There's a good chance we'll see the share price drop to the low 40s in the near future if any of the above happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I'm pretty optimistic and I think the dividend is safe for the foreseeable future. The dividend hike this year will probably be low (around 4%), but with a yield over 6%, I'm happy to sit and wait to see how things pan out. (It's been raised 53 times in the last 49 years).

It is often joked that Altria is a law firm/lobby group that sells cigarettes on the side. I actually think they might have played a role in Dr. Gottlieb stepping down has head of the FDA. [Especially since he'd recently said he had no plans of doing so.](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article227145919.html) After the master settlement debacle of the late 90s, I think tobacco companies have learned to tread very carefully moving forward. I think they'll continue to generate profits and reward shareholders in the long run. I also think it's likely PM might buy PM USA from MO as more people switch from cigarettes to IQOS (Their current agreement is to split the revenues on IQOS sales). PM has over $35 billion in treasury stock, so they won't have too much trouble paying for the deal (I'm just speculating here). PM and MO are well known for being extremely shareholder friendly. I don't expect this to change going forward.

I applied for a loan that would consolidate one credit card ($2500) with a higher interest rate for a total of $9000.

I also have 2 other credit cards. One amazon rewards card at $1750 and a general card at $2400. 

I was approved for the loan on the stipulation that I pay off both the $1750 and $2400 before the loan is granted. That is not a possibility at this time unfortunately.

Even without the debt consolidation, they are asking that I pay off the $2500 card before granting the loan.

My question is, would a cosigner help alleviate/remove those stipulations from the loan? We are in a desperate way right now with a home at nearly 90°. I have an appointment tomorrow with a loan officer and I wanted to know my chances before going in.

Any help is appreciated! 

Peace.

Edit: Thank you guys for the help. We bought a window unit and my wife is going back to work next week. We should be on our way to debt free soon.",finance

personalfinance,Balance Transfer Check - Citi - A few questions,"Hi guys,

I was approved for a balance transfer with Citi where I will be moving balances from AMEX to Citi for the 0% 21mo APR promo. 

In this process, I elected for the balance transfer check to be sent to my residence in order to deposit and utilize the cash to pay off a couple of high interest rate cards. 

I have never done this before (a balance transfer) and I am just wondering what this process will look like. 

I'm hoping that someone who may have selected this option during this process can provide some clarity as I am unable to contact Citi without the card activated yet to ask a few questions that I have:

1. Is this check considered taxable income?
2. If the check is not cashed, does the ""balance transfer credit usage"" disappear?
3. Does the check come in the mail at the same time as the credit card?
4. If not, in your experience when did the check arrive?

Thanks very much for any insight you can share. It's very much appreciated.",finance

I need your advice, I currently have around $10,000 left in student loan which I plan to pay by the end of the year, I have been driving a company car for about 1 year, this is a Toyota Corolla 2016, the company offers me the option to buy the car at the price that they would get if they sold at a dealership, they offered me $0 down payment and close to 0% interest (minimum legal interest for a loan) to be paid during 4 years, I will get a $11,000 raise if I drive my own car so continuing using the company car is definitely not an option as I would not get the raise.

The car is in excellent shape, it has got 30,000 miles and has always been serviced at the dealership.

1. 401k - Right now I contribute 9%. Should I increase this to **14%**?
2. Roth IRA - Contribution is 1%. Should I increase the contribution of this to **2%** if I want to primarily contribute to Traditional IRA instead?
3. Traditional IRA  - I believe with my first job, I contributed a small amount. With my current job that I started earlier this year, I don't contribute anything. After doing some research, I've decided that I want to prioritize contributing toward a Traditional rather than Roth. Would **4%** be a decent amount?
4. Roth and Traditional IRA - I was thinking of maybe doing this through Wealthfront. Does anyone have experience on this to tell me whether or not this would be a good idea?
5. Savings account - Currently my savings account is with Ally. Should I transfer this to Wealthfront? And how much of my salary should I contribute toward this?
6. Debit card - I do direct deposit and have a checking account through Navy Federal. I've had this ever since I was about 17 or 18. However, I just opened a checking account with Charles Schwab. I'm keeping the Navy Federal account in case I ever need to deposit cash because CS doesn't have this capability. Was this a good move?
7. How the heck do I even get started with investing in Wealthfront and Robinhood? Does anyone have any tips for beginners?

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 22nd, 2019.

# **Week ahead: Earnings, GDP expected to show sluggish growth as investors await rate cut  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/19/earnings-gdp-to-show-sluggish-gains-as-some-see-big-rate-cut-coming.html)**
*****
&gt; Sluggish economic and earnings growth will be a theme in markets in the week ahead, as investors await a Fed interest rate cut at the end of the month.
*****
&gt; More than a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings in the coming week, the second big week of the second quarter reporting season. FAANG names, like Alphabet and Amazon, and blue chips from McDonald’s to Boeingand United Technologies are among the more than 130 companies reporting.
*****
&gt; There is also some key economic data, including Friday’s second quarter GDP, which should show a slowing to 1.8% from the first quarter’s 3.1% pace, according to Refinitiv. On Thursday, durable goods are reported and will include an update on businesses investment. There are also existing home sales Tuesday, new home sales Wednesday and advance economic indicators Thursday.
*****
&gt; But there will be no Fed speakers, after a parade of central bank officials in the past week, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The most impactful comments, however, came Thursday from New York Fed President John Williams, who set off a debate about how much the Fed could cut rates at its July 30-31 meeting — 25 or 50 basis points.
*****
&gt; Even as the New York Fed later said Williams comments were not about current policy, market pros took heed of his words about how central bankers should “act quickly.”
*****
&gt; Fed dominates
&gt; Fed officials do not speak publicly in the days ahead of policy meetings, but market pros will find plenty to debate. Fed funds futures were predicting a 43% chance of a 50 basis point cut in July, after shooting as high as 70% Thursday afternoon.
*****
&gt; “For sure, the Fed is going to dominate for next week. I think we’ll get at least a 25 basis point cut. I’m thinking we’re not going to get 50 basis point cut...The Fed has been burned when it’s been bold,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust.
*****
&gt; Roth said he believes the market is already pricing in a quarter-point cut, and he does not see the Fed’s rate cut as much of a longer-term catalyst for stocks. If it trims by a half percentage point, he expects just a short-term pop.
*****
&gt; Economists believe the Fed will cut interest rates even though recent data has improved. That’s in part because Powell has stressed the Fed is focused on the global economic slowdown, trade wars and low inflation, and that it will do what it takes to keep the economy expanding.
*****
&gt; “The only real catalyst that would really help the market would be if there was a trade deal with China,” Roth said. “I think the likelihood of that is less than &gt; 10%. We’re very pessimistic on the possibility of a real deal with China prior to the [2020 presidential] election.”
*****
&gt; So, in the void ahead of the Fed’s meeting, the market will be watching earnings. As earnings rolled out this past week, stocks took a rest from their record-setting streak, as some companies lowered forecasts and most beat earnings and revenue estimates.
*****
&gt; As of Friday morning, 77% of the roughly 80 companies reporting had beaten earnings estimates, and 65% topped revenue forecasts, according to Refinitiv. Based on actual reports and forecasts, earnings per share for the S&amp;P companies are expected to be up 1% in the second quarter. That is up from expectations that the profit growth would be slightly negative this quarter.
*****
&gt; “If you look at the numbers, we’re above the averages for top and bottom line beats, but at the same time when you look at revisions, every day we’re getting revisions for third and fourth quarter, and they’re coming down.There’s a real worry of an earnings recession, when you get out into the third and fourth quarter and out to next year,” Roth said.
*****
Roth said he’s currently neutral on risk assets, and he sees a slowdown brewing in the smallest U.S. companies that could spread up the food chain.
*****
&gt; “We do see those fundamental cracks in the economy in small business and the small business labor market, and on top of that you have these big macro risks out there,” such as trade and the upcoming election, Roth said.
*****
&gt; Slower economy
As earnings growth was muted in the second quarter, so was the pace of economic gains. If growth comes in as expected, it would be the first quarter where growth was under 2% since the first quarter of 2017. Economists are watching to see how consumer spending fared in the quarter, after a recent pickup and also whether business inventories are declining.
*****
&gt; “The data we need is not Q2. What’s at risk is the growth and magnitude of the Fed rate cut. I don’t think Q2 is going to have much impact on the Fed’s thinking,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “It’s really how Q3 is progressing. It seems to me the economy softened in April and May and picked up in June with jobs data, retail sales and manufacturing sector.”
*****
&gt; Chandler said investors will also be focused on the European Central Bank, which some economists believe could cut its overnight deposit rate to negative 0.5% from negative 0.4% currently when it meets Thursday. Chandler said odds are about 50% for the rate cut, which many also expect in September.
*****
&gt; “While we’re waiting for the Fed to figure out whether it’s 25 or 50 basis points, and we’re waiting for the ECB to get all its forms sorted out ... the emerging markets are pushing ahead,” said Chandler, noting Russia and Turkey could cut rates in the next several days, after similar moves in the past week by South Africa, South Korea and Indonesia.
*****
&gt; “It just makes the story more global. You’re seeing the trade numbers from China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea weaken. You’re seeing exports form China suffer. Exports from all of Asia are suffering,” he said. “The big surprise for China and Japan has also been on the import side. The declines in their imports is really someone else’s [drop in] exports.”
*****
&gt; Rate cuts and currency wars
&gt; Dollar strength has been a consequence of the trade war, and Fed action could help turn it around.
*****
&gt; “If the Fed fails to move, you’re going to end up with an increasingly stronger dollar,” which impacts corporate earnings, Roth said.
*****
&gt; “The dollar is quite strong and is increasingly going to be a headwind for U.S. companies. It hasn’t appreciated that much in 12 months, but if we see a divergence in monetary policy between the U.S. and the rest of the world, you would see a carry trade develop where people would want to buy assets in the U.S.,” he said.
*****
&gt; The dollar index was slightly higher on the week, but Wall Street has been focused on President Donald Trump’s negative comments on the currency’s strength. As Trump has criticized the Fed, he also complains that other central banks manipulate their currencies to give them an edge in trade. Trump has said the Fed should already be cutting rates, something it hasn’t done since December 2008.
*****
&gt; A number of Wall Street strategists have said they now believe it is possible that the U.S. government could intervene to weaken the dollar, but that would be unlikely.

# Lagging Small-caps: Seasonal and Economic Factors Weigh

&gt; Small-caps measured by the performance of the Russell 2000 have been lagging since mid-March with the gap in performance widening in June and continuing into July. At yesterday’s close the Russell 2000 was up 15.35% year-to-date compared to a gain of 19.87% for the Russell 1000. Based upon historical trends this is not unusual for this time of the year nor during times when U.S. economic data is mixed.

&gt; In the following chart the one-year seasonal pattern of the Russell 2000/Russell 1000 has been plotted (solid black line with grey fill) along with 2019 year-to-date (blue line). This chart is similar to the chart found on page 110 of the 2019 Stock Trader’s Almanac. When the lines are rising small-caps are outperforming, when the lines are falling small-caps are lagging. Small-caps exhibited typical seasonal strength during the first quarter but have been fading ever since. In some years, small-cap strength can last until mid-June however, that is not the case this year. Going forward, small-cap underperformance is likely to persist until early in the fourth quarter with possible a hint of strength at the end of August.

# Robust Summer Rallies Trim Fall Pullbacks

&gt; It’s usually about this time of the year, when trading volumes begin to slump and markets meander that we begin to hear talk of the infamous “Summer Rally” featured on page 74 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019. The “Summer Rally” is usually the weakest seasonal rally of them all.

&gt; We looked at the current Summer Rally and found it to be above average already, up 10.2% from the Spring low on May 31, and that does portend well for the Summer and Fall Corrections. We lined up the Summer Rallies ranked from weakest to strongest since 1964. Over the past 55 years prior to this year DJIA has rallied and average of 9.1% from its May/June low until its Q3 high. The Fall Rally averages 10.9% and the Summer and Fall Corrections average a loss of just under 9% for a net average gain of a few percentage points over the summer and fall.

&gt; As shown in the table below, when the Summer Rally is greater than or equal to the 55-year 9.1% average, the summer and fall correction tend to be bit milder, -6.2% and -8.2%, respectively. Summer Rally gains beyond 12.5% historically had the smallest summer and fall corrections. One prominent exception being 1987.

# Earnings (and Guidance) Likely to Make or Break the Rally

&gt; Once again today, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ closed at new all-time highs. With today’s modest gains, DJIA is up 17.3% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 is even better at 20.2% while NASDAQ is still best at 24.5%. Compared to historical average performance in pre-election years at this time of the year, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 are comfortably above average. NASDAQ’s impressive 24.5% gain is just average (since 1971). NASDAQ’s Midyear Rally delivered again, but officially ended last Friday. The seasonal pattern charts, above and below, along with July’s typical performance over the last 21 years suggest further gains during the balance of July and the third quarter could be limited. For the market to make meaningful gains in the near-term earnings will need to decent and forward guidance will also need to be firm.

# ""We Don't Need Your Stinking Data""

&gt; Yesterday was another one of those days that makes you scratch your head. In a relatively busy day for economic data, Initial Jobless Claims came in within 25K of a 50-year low, and the Philly Fed Manufacturing report saw its largest m/m increase in a decade. That follows other data last week where Retail Sales were very strong and CPI and PPI both came in ahead of consensus forecasts. The trend of better than expected data since the June employment report on July 5th is reflected in recent moves of the Citi Economic Surprise Index which has rallied from -68.3 up to -41.5. Granted, it’s still negative, but what was looking like a real dismal backdrop for the economy just three weeks ago seems to be showing signs of improvement.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/071819-Citi.png))**

&gt; On top of the economic data, two notable interviews from FOMC officials Williams from New York and Vice Chair Clarida moved markets. Given the strong tone of economic data, one would expect both officials to try and tone down rising market expectations regarding any aggressive policy moves at the July meeting. Well, markets don’t always make sense.

&gt; In their respective interviews, both Williams and Clarida not only didn’t tone down expectations, but they added fuel to the fire. Williams noted that “it pays to act quickly to lower rates"" and ""vaccinate” the economy ""against further ills."" Clarida was even more direct when he said that “Research shows you act preemptively when you can.” In other words, the data-dependent Fed is casting the data aside and ready to move anyway. In his interview on Fox Business, Clarida almost got a chuckle when asked whether there was any chance the Fed wouldn’t cut rates in July.

&gt; The dovish turn from the Fed was immediately reflected in market expectations for rate policy at the July meeting. Back in June, market expectations for a 50 basis points (bps) cut at the next meeting peaked out at under 50%. Then, in the days following the June employment report, expectations dropped all the way down to 3%. In the last ten days, though, the trend has completely reversed, and as of yesterday’s close topped out at 71% versus just a 29% chance for a 25 bps cut. Probabilities for a 50 bps cut came in a bit overnight but are still at about 50/50. Yesterday alone, though, expectations for a 25 bps cut and a 50 bps cut more than completely reversed from the prior day, and remember, that’s after what was a good day of economic data! Can you imagine what expectations would be like if the data was actually bad?

# US Beats World When It Comes to Stocks

&gt; The Bloomberg World index is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 stocks from around the world (including US stocks). While the S&amp;P 500 has been hitting new all-time highs over the last week, the Bloomberg World index remains 7% below highs that it last made back in January 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bworld.png))**

&gt; Below is a chart showing the ratio of the S&amp;P 500 to the Bloomberg World index since the World index's inception back in August 2003. While the World index outperformed the US for five years in the mid-2000s, the US has been outperforming since the end of 2007, which includes both the Financial Crisis and the bull market that has been in place since the 2009 lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/USvsworld.png))**

&gt; Along with the relative strength chart between the two indices above, below we show the price change of the S&amp;P 500 versus the Bloomberg World index since August 2003. Through today, the S&amp;P was up 203% versus a gain of 142% for the Bloomberg World index.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/percentchange.png))**

&gt; Since the November 2016 election, the S&amp;P 500 is up 40% versus a gain of 26% for the Bloomberg World index. Notably, the World index kept up with the S&amp;P through early 2018, but weakness for the World index in mid-2018 and a failure to bounce back as much as the US this year has left the World index well behind.

# Best Performing Stocks Over the Last 12 Months

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up over 20% YTD, but over the last 12 months, it is up just under 10% on a total return basis. And within the S&amp;P 1500, there are only 44 stocks that are up more than 50% on a total return basis over the last 12 months. These 44 stocks are listed below.

&gt; Innovative Industrials (IIPR) -- a cannabis REIT -- has been the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 1500 over the last year with a total return of 302%. In second place is eHealth (EHTH) with a gain of 269%, followed by Avon Products (AVP) at +174.8% and Coca-Cola Bottling (COKE) at +128.58%. Coca-Cola Bottling is probably one of the last names you would have guessed as a top five performer over the last year! Other notables on the list of biggest winners include Advanced Micro (AMD), LendingTree (TREE), Starbucks (SBUX), AutoZone (AZO), Chipotle (CMG), Hershey (HSY), and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG).

&gt; Some names that aren't on the list that you may have expected to see? AMZN, NFLX, MSFT? Nope. None of the mega-cap Tech companies are on the list of biggest winners due to serious weakness from this group in Q4 2018.

# 2% Days Few and Far Between

&gt; Although the last two trading days have seen exceptionally narrow daily ranges, today we wanted to take a quick look at the S&amp;P 500's frequency of 2% daily moves (either up or down) in the post-WWII period. The chart below breaks out the frequency of 2% days by year, and years with more than 25 one-day moves of 2% are notated accordingly.

&gt; Overall, there have been an average of 11 daily 2% moves in a given year. After five straight years from 2007 to 2011 where we saw an above-average number of 2% days, the last seven years have only seen one year with an above-average number of occurrences (2018, 21). Remember, in 2017 there wasn't one single trading day that saw the S&amp;P move up or down 2%!

&gt; So far this year, there have only been four 2% days, but with the most volatile part of the year on tap, we are likely to see that number increase in the months ahead. Don't expect the relative calm that we have seen in the last few trading days to last forever. Volatility is unpredictable and usually comes up and surprises you when you least expect it!

personalfinance,Someone help assess my current situation!,"Hello I’m mid 20s living in CA. My take home pay is around $4400/month ($100k gross yearly).
Expenses: 
- $1200/month rent (split with partner) 
 - 10% contribution to retirement account (457 with fidelity) with employer along with pension plan contributions (honestly unsure what percentage my employer matches in my employer account, but I’m not yet “vested; also have seen recommendations to increase by 1% every year?) 
- $400/month student loans (paying double, owe $14k) 
- $400/month emergency fund savings (almost at 3-month spending) 
- $400/month travel fund 
- $112/month car insurance 
- $80/month cell phone 
- $240/month family members 
- $44/month dog health insurance plus any expenses such as grooming, flea and heart worm meds, food 
- $90/month utilities 
- $200/month groceries 
- $60/month car fuel
-  $250-$500/month other/fun money- clothes, home supplies, eating out, etc.
- I know these numbers dont total the exact $4400, the extra money often goes to other large purchases I may make, or extra spending related to my profession (license, etc) and even medical bills

I also have a traditional IRA I opened at the advice of a financial advisor at my old job. I moved my retirement account money (non profit employer) to a traditional IRA after I quit but it’s just sitting and I don’t contribute to it. I figured I could contribute my student loan money to it when I’m done paying those off?

My emergency fund is in an Ally savings account with 2.08% interest rate.

I pay almost everything with a credit card and pay my balance in full.

Credit is near excellent.

I’m just looking for input in areas I could improve or make changes to. I don’t necessarily see myself and my partner being able to buy a house anytime soon- is there a special account I should open to start saving for a down payment?

Also- looking to start grad school within 5 years. Any advice on savings for that and/or loan to take out?

How do I know if I am maxing my contributions to my retirement account?

All advice is appreciated, but I am not too familiar with the lingo here. I would appreciate any explanations in the format of ELI5, if possible.

Thank you!

Edit: I also have to pay union dues: ~$120/month (those are deducted from my paycheck and I don't have to budget for that.)

Edit 2: Through my employer I have a 457 plan that they match to an extent (need to figure out exactly how much) and a pension plan. However, I don't plan on necessarily retiring from my job so unclear if I will be able to reap these benefits.",finance
personalfinance,"Need serious help, nearly 34k in credit card debt, College student about to be out of work for at least 4 months.","I am currently about $34k in debt between 4 different Credit cards.   


Credit Union Card 1: $15,000 - APR 18%  
Credit Union Card 2:  $4,200 - APR 15.24%

AMEX Card - $13,00 - 21.24%

Wells Fargo Student Card: $1,200 - 16.4%

&amp;#x200B;

Without getting into too much detail, I have made some mistakes in the past that ended up costing me dearly (financial and otherwise). And I am trying to get myself out of this hole and put my life back together as we speak. I have considerably cut down on my spending and weigh each purchase as is it something I need rather than something I want. It hasn't been easy but I a m still working on it. I want to find the best method for getting these cards paid of and getting out of debt in the most timely manner possible. My credit score has been steadily dropping over the last couple of years and now sits at a 613.   


Here is the kicker. I am a college student about to start my senior year for ME at one of the best engineering schools in the country (graduating this coming May). I am currently on my last month of an internship before I go back in august. The internship pays very little and between my CC fees/interest rates I really can't seem to get ahead no matter how hard I try. Also, I will likely be out of work for at least the coming semester because the workload between my classes and senior design is daunting enough to where I barely even have time to sleep so working a job is nearly impossible. My last semester should only be one class and senior design so I may have the possibility of finding a part time job then at the very least. Nonetheless, for the next 4 months come late august I will likely be out of work.   


This next year scares the crap out of me and I have been losing sleep over this for some time now. On top of that I have a 26k of federal student loans  and a 10k private student loan that I will have to worry about come 6 months after graduating. I can't get assistance from my parents as one of them is retired and the other works a very low income job. I have my tuition and living expenses covered for the next year via the student loans but I worry about my credit card debt.   


I have been looking at a couple of options such as lending club to possibly take out a loan to pay at least one of the cards off or getting a 0% APR balance transfer card like Chase Slate to alleviate some of the hit to my wallet from the high rate payments every month. I am also pretty close to my credit limit on most of these cards. At this point I just want to make it through the next year so that I can graduate, find a good job and start paying this debt off. Any kind of advice is appreciated. At this point the last thing that I want to do is dig myself deeper into this hole.",finance

personalfinance,Student loan decision and questions,"I went to the main campus of my states flagship college, UConn, for one year. I wasn't really thinking about the cost and just assumed that I had to take out loans to be able to get a good job in the future. Right now I have about $7,500 in federal student loans, with tuition going up $500 this next semester. 


What I'm trying to decide is whether or not I should instead go to a branch campus closer to me for cheaper, probably about half the cost. The issue is that for my selected major I can only attend this branch for one year and after that I'd need to either go back to the main campus or transfer to a different school closer to me if I wanted to continue saving money. 

My main questions is if it's worth it to go to a branch campus for one year and then have to make another big decision in another year. Considering that I've built some relationships at the main campus, don't have a car at home(the branch campus is like 10 mins away tho, so not a big deal) and that if I stayed home I'd have to keep my summer job which I don't really like too much, I'm just having an insanely hard time making this decision. 

Lastly, I'm wondering if someone can tell me whether or not the quality of education would go down at a branch campus and whether or not it would be worth it in that regard.

personalfinance,20 Years Old and Wondering How to Finish School,"Hey guys, so I am in a sort of dilemma here and need advice from people who know how to handle a situation like mine. I graduated high school in North Carolina in 2017 and immediately enrolled in community college the following semester. I took 2 semesters of classes and combined with my AP credits from high school, I was only about 10 credits away from receiving my A.S. Instead of finishing out my AS, I had gotten accepted to my dream school in NYC... I feel like you can see where this is going. My school in NYC that I attended last year is public and actually not very expensive for an out-of-state school. It is under a 2+2 program so you receive an associates degree and THEN a bachelor's degree after another two years. Due to being a transfer student, I obtained my associates degree in 1 year after taking the specialized classes for it. My Grandparents put a little money towards my expenses for the year and I took out loans equaling to about 15k to finish it all off. I still have 2 full years to graduate and receive my bachelor's degree. Now since its' summer, I'm back home and trying to figure out ways to go back to my school in NYC. I realize now that If I funded my own personal expenses with a job but don't put any money back towards my tuition and rent, I will graduate with about 80k in debt.

 Every loan application I try (with cosigner) I get extremely high interest rates to the tune of about 10%-12% or do not get accepted at all. I realize that if I even figure out a way to go back to this school, I may graduate with a large amount of student debt. Lately I've been wondering if I should just take a year off and work to pay back my existing loans and figure out what I should do. Maybe I could transfer to an In-State School? My father is pressuring me to just take out the loans blindly but I know the dangers of this and he is not in a great financial situation himself. Neither is my mother who I primarily live with. I really want to get my bachelor's degree but don't know how to do it without putting myself into extreme debt. I am on my own now in terms of money and need to figure out a way to do everything myself. Thank you guys a lot any advice is welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

Vechain,Writeup of the OceanEx Meetup + Bonus Information from One-on-One talk with Sunny and Nan,"I did a writeup of the OceanEx Meetup. For VeChain related things scroll down a little. There's actually more of that than information regarding OCE I think.

Here are all the photos of the slides that I took:

OCE slides (inlcuding small roadmap):  [https://imgur.com/a/pXVGuP6](https://imgur.com/a/pXVGuP6)

VeChain slides (including an updated version of a slide Sunny often used in the past):  [https://imgur.com/a/1OeRZAz](https://imgur.com/a/1OeRZAz)

There are also 2 more slides from OCE in this thread that I don't have regarding their growth:   [https://twitter.com/ex\_zerg/status/1152581353604616193](https://twitter.com/ex_zerg/status/1152581353604616193)

**OceanEx Part:**

First Nan presented the recent OceanEx achievements and some numbers. One thing I didn't know is that they also have engineers around the world (Europe, America, Canada, etc.) so that there are people ensuring the security of the exchange 24/7. There were also some nice growth numbers comparing this quarter with last quarter.

Afterwards there was a technical Deep Dive by the CTO Jiayu Zhou. He made a really knowledgable impression on me and was able to explain some of the complicated technicals quite well. The focus of OceanEx is on security and that came through pretty well.

* There are only a select few who have access to the production system (to make it more secure).
* They are trying to predict withdrawals but this is a really hard thing to do. The reason they want to do this is because it is needed to know how much of a given asset has to be in the hot wallet at any given time so that there is enough if someone wants to withdraw but not too much in case their system gets compromised and the funds in the hot wallet get stolen (this is an extreme scenario but even if that happens they want the damage to be minimal). They now found a good way to predict these withdrawals quite accurately through OceanBrain. I can't say much more about this than what is on the slides and what I already wrote though.
* They are **working with Cornell University** to further improve security on the platform.

**VeChain Part:**

Then the man himself, Sunny Lu, took the stage.

* He started off by repeating that how much TPS you can do is not that important if no one uses your blockchain. What matters is the use cases that drive the technical needs.
* 2016 was a tough year for them. They knocked on about 60 doors of companies and only got into talks with 3-4 of them. 2017 and 2018 have been entirely different though. **Businesses** (big and small) **started to request at VeChain** instead of the other way around.
* VeChain has got the startup advantage - flexibility - in comparison to other big companies so they can try a lot of things with little resources. Agile was another word he dropped.
* Governments are looking at Blockchain (as can be seen in recent talks in the US Senate about blockchain) and are starting with the regulations around the world.
* **Companies** don't care that much about the technology (capabilities), they **just want a good solution to their specific problem.**
* Blockchain will be as revolutionizing as the Internet in his opinion.
* Because of current legislation, \[some\] companies are not allowed to hold any cryptos (VET and VTHO included). -&amp;gt; Solution: Set up a sponsor for you that does your transactions on the blockchain (effectively the companies paying VeChain to get the VTHO). They have done this several times already and ToolChain is based on the same principle. I also heard something of ""OCE as payment provider"" but didn't quite understand it.
* MPP and MTT can work together really well.
* Most companies use MTT. It could for example also be used by a company to pay the salary to your 100 or so employees through only 1 simple transaction.
* **Regarding the On-Chain Governance / Voting System: it is currently in internal testing and will be available in 1-2 months depending on how the testing will go.** This could also be used in elections.
* **If there is the need for a reduction in VTHO/Gas needed for one transaction**, the Steering Committee can start a vote (**only voted on by the members in the Committee**) and if it is successful the change could be implemented instantly via a smart contract. **When there will ever be the need to increase VTHO production, this would be voted on by the entire community**, bc a hard-fork would be needed for it. The Committee would then in advance vote on how much % of the community would have to vote 'Yes' for the vote to be successful and the change implemented.
* You can do transactions on VeChain that will only execute if certain requirements are met.
* Sunny doesn't believe in total decentralisation, in his opinion there needs to be a  balance between centralisation and decentralisation so you still have some control and can remain flexible. Over time you can then implement more decentralisation.
* VeVID is ready since some time and will be used for KYC and AML. **VeKey** is, if I understood correctly, a **hardware device for signing transactions** (edit: and voting according to one slide) (e.g. **with your fingerprint**) to make sure it's really you and to keep the data integrity (he mentioned smth with audits, so that only the auditor could sign the transaction so that there's no tempering with the audit).
* **Enterprises don't choose VeChain for nothing.**
* I think this was regarding ToolChain: The first step is to get the registration to the blockchain. As a second step you can then easily either create your own ecosystem (as a business) or you can simply join existing ones (like the carbon initiative).
* The new Whitepaper will be on VechainWorld.io once it's out and there you can easily check what was changed compared to the older version and why it was changed.
* **Fenbushi Capital only invested in one company in 2019, and that company is OceanEx.**

**Q&amp;amp;A + questions I asked after the meetup was over:**

* Will there be an **OCE Token Burn** like with BNB? -&gt; There's **nothing definite yet** but they may just use the trading fees collected for such things, but as I understood them they would rather like to use it for community development / incentives.
* Will the **Fiat Gateway** be available in China? -&gt; **The fiat gateway is pretty much finished and will roll out soon but won't be available in China because of their regulations.** They practically don't want any money to leave the country (there apparently is a limit of 50k USD for every citizen that he/she is allowed to send out of the country every year). Nonetheless the Chinese government doesn't have anything against Crypto-to-Crypto trading.
* Some question about the **UNDP** and what they are doing with them in regards to the SDG (Sustainability Development Goals) -&gt; They have **partnered up with UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) and DNV GL** to reach the SDGs they set. One step to do this is in fact the Carbon Initiative / Ecosystem. Around the world the current price for one tonne of Carbon emission is around $30 while in China it is around $4,50. **Their plan, together with the UNDP, is to mainly reach China with the carbon initiative to raise awareness there and give more incentives to Chinese companies for reducing their carbon emissions.** (According to some things I've read in the past hour there may be news on this as early as next week and that another country would use the Carbon project, but I must confess that I didn't hear neither of these so it's just speculation for me.)
* Question regarding X-Node benefits -&gt; They continue to find ways to give rewards to X-Nodes, as seen recently with the Airdrop during the AMA, and they are constantly trying to get more benefits for these Nodes, also on OceanEx. OceanEx at the same time wants to make sure that there are enough benefits for their own OCE-Club members, so there is a bit of a conflict of interests there. They need to find the balance between the two. (This last part Nan told me.)
* Question regarding VTHO/transaction cost price -&gt; The goal is not to keep VTHO stable, the goal is to keep transaction costs relatively stable. The way to do this is not by instantly raising the VTHO generation rate since this would be like instantly pulling the nuke. He compared it to Central Banks - they don't instantly raise or lower interest rates, or print more money (although they do that often enough), they go through all the other options first.

**I talked with Nan and Sunny (separately) after the meetup was over:**

* Nan said the problem with Tether is that it doesn't have a really good reputation right now but that they **will list more pairs against Tether and also other stable coins** (like Pax, USDC, etc.) in the future. Also that there will be **more pairs against BTC.About pairs against OCE** he said there'll be some but not against every coin (like BNB) since they worry about liquidity if there are like a thousand pairs and don't want any flash crashes.
* I also asked Nan how I could know that an X-Node isn't already bound to another OceanEx account if I buy it and what I could do if it already is. He answered that if I buy an X-Node I could simply write a ticket to the support and they would unbind it from the other account and bind it to mine.
* I asked Sunny about the **Settlement Coin** and if he could give some information. He told me that he can't right now but that **we could expect news on it (early) next week**, so I guess we won't have to wait much longer til there is some clarification.
* Furthermore I asked him how much a transaction should approximately cost. He couldn't say a specific number but as he mentioned in the AMA, he thinks the cost for a transaction is still relatively low compared to the value it brings to some customers. For example with the milk from Cupid's Farm, they can sell it at a 30% mark up compared to similar products because of this feature (edit: being able to track the milk and guaranteeing a 24-hour timeframe from the cow to the table) and it still sells pretty well.
* He also said that there are a couple of smaller businesses complaining to him that the transaction costs would be too high. He then told me that there are tons of ways to lower your own transaction costs as a business and that this is how it should work in the real world (competition, etc.). He gave me an example with wine bottles: A high priced quality wine bottle would obviously get its own ID, therefore the transaction cost for it would be a bit higher, but compared to the price of the bottle it would be marginal.Now if you got some medium quality wine, like $25 a bottle, you don't really need an own ID for every single bottle. You could just track the whole case, a batch or even more than that (he said a car full of bottles haha) for that and thus your transaction costs would be way lower. Again compared to the value of the whole case/batch/car the cost would be fractional. The point he was making is that **there are multiple ways to lower transaction costs as a business.** You don't necessarily need the foundation to do that.

On a last note I'd like to say that it was incredible to finally meet Sunny and the others in person. I'm invested in VeChain since October 2017 and it's been a fun ride ever since and this meetup was a great opportunity to make sure I made the right investment - I did! Sunny is a really charismatic and smart guy, you could easily listen to him for hours on end. I was also impressed by the CTO of OceanEx and by Daniel Kelman, their and Sunny's lawyer, both also very smart and knowledgable about their respective fields. I think the latter is someone that gets rarely talked about but who is doing tons of work behind the scenes for **both** OceanEx **and** VeChain!

If I forgot anything or if there is a mistake, please let me know.

Edit: I listened to Sunny talking to another guy at the meetup who asked about price suppression / manipulation on Binance. Sunny said he's very aware of that but can't do much against it right now and that it for sure isn't them. He said as regulations start to roll out, phony stuff like this will decrease and VET should then finally get what it deserves. Hopes are that with Binance closing their doors to US customers in September that the suppression will get less. Also if there would ever be something like this on OceanEx, there may be measures taken to ban these users.

One thing is for sure: Both VeChain and OceanEx are doing everything they can to be compliant with regulations and in the long run these will be the players who will succeed in this space.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Need advice - randfather's life insurance is maturing before he is deceased,"Hi everyone,

I have a problem I haven't had to deal with in all my personal finance planning -- my grandfather has beaten the odds and has outlived the maturity of his universal life insurance policy and now they're forcing him to cash it out at the end of August.

There's some complications with this - 

1) he can't get a new life insurance policy to roll it into as he's 95 years old
2) it's a large sum of money (over a half a million taxable has accrued) and neither of my grandparents need that money currently. Per its rules it's considered general income when it's paid out if you're alive.
3) The plan was essentially to use it after my grandfather passed (and with that payouts like his pension and social) to help make up the financial difference with my grandmother's care, but given their current finances I don't think my grandmother will need it after his passing.
4) the goal is to avoid paying federal taxes on an actual payout and hopefully defer it to the estate/beneficiary in his eventual passing -- hopefully making interest along the way. The most difficult part is we just don't know how long he'll live. I'm trying to plan for another 10 years just to be on the safer side as he's continually beat all the odds.

Has anyone gone through this with managing an elderly persons finances? We're looking at different annuities that have multiple deferment options after the 5 year expiry with various minimum payouts and interests but it's something completely foreign to me so I'm feeling a little overwhelmed.",finance
Bitcoin,"Honest, Quality BitCoin market?","Guys, I’m trying to find an honest, high-quality bitcoin market from which I can buy coins, receive them and send them immediately without having arbitrary obstacles set in my way.
 
My first experiment was with Coinbase; the experience was disastrous with support which didn’t respond for weeks and made me jump through hoops for account identification. Just now I tried to make a purchase and they slapped a 16-day waiting period on my BTCs. They took my money but won’t give me my coins until some arbitrary time has passed.
 
After my first bad experience I opened an account with Coinmama; their ID process was quicker and less annoying, and I never had to contact their support. They don’t have a wallet, though, and they sell coins in US dollars—but not buy them in US dollars. Coinmama was quick and reliable for buying coins and sending them — until now. Because Coinbase screwed me with the waiting period I went to Coinmama....to get an email stating that order has to be processed manually and there will be a delay.
 
I’m getting fed up with this nonsense. Are there any markets which will let me buy coins and send/sell them without obstacles?",cryptocurrency

stocks,"$TSLA set to tank on Monday? Tesla cuts prices again, modeling the Detroit vehicle distribution model.","Copied directly  from the website (written by Motley Fool so take it with a grain of salt)

tl;dr at the bottom...

“Earlier this month, Tesla  (NASDAQ:TSLA)  reported that it delivered a record 95,200 vehicles during the second quarter, bouncing back from a dreadful start to the year. (Deliveries totaled just 63,000 in the first quarter.) It also said that its order backlog increased last quarter. While Tesla hasn't released its full quarterly earnings report yet, this update seemed to indicate that the electric vehicle pioneer was getting itself back on track.
However, Tesla rolled out yet another series of price cuts and options adjustments earlier this week. This renews questions about the strength of demand. Furthermore, these changes could have other negative short-term and long-term impacts on Tesla's business.


In the latest update to its lineup, Tesla dropped the standard-range versions of the Model S and Model X again, after reintroducing them earlier this year. It has also reduced the price of the long-range variants. On balance, this means that the entry-level Model S price is about $5,000 higher in the U.S. today than it was a week ago. The increase was about $4,000 for the Model X. Customers buying the pricier performance package now get ""Ludicrous Mode"" included, rather than having to pay $20,000 extra for that option.


The price of the cheapest Model 3 variant available for online ordering decreased by $1,000 to $38,990. (The $35,000 base model is still available ""off-menu"" by phone.) The prices of several other options (or option packages) have been adjusted as well -- downwards, for the most part.


Tesla explained these moves as follows: ""We are also adjusting our pricing in order to continue to improve affordability for customers. Like other car companies, we periodically adjust pricing and available options.""


In reality, Tesla is changing its pricing and options at an unprecedented clip. By mid-March, it had already implemented four price changes this year, and there have been more adjustments since then. These frequent pricing changes are bad news for Tesla bulls.
Margin pressure is likely to continue
The most obvious risk for Tesla is that its price cuts will undermine its profitability. Tesla posted an ugly $702 million net loss in Q1 2019 after being solidly profitable in the second half of 2018. Automotive gross margin, excluding zero-emission vehicle credits and stock-based compensation, fell to 20.3% in the first quarter from 24.7% a quarter earlier.
The sharp drop in Tesla's deliveries drove part of that decline. However, Tesla acknowledged that price reductions and an unfavorable mix shift also contributed to its gross margin erosion.


The unfavorable mix shift continued last quarter, as the company began delivering the cheapest version of the Model 3 and sales of the pricier Model S and Model X continued to plunge. Price changes also put downward pressure on gross margin. As a result, most analysts believe that Tesla lost money in Q2 despite delivering a record number of vehicles.
It's true that in the latest round of adjustments, the entry-level prices for the Model S and Model X increased significantly. However, those starting prices are actually just $790 higher than they were in late April -- only customers are now getting a long-range battery rather than a standard battery for roughly the same price. That's great for buyers, but bad for Tesla's profitability.
Tesla is confusing -- and angering -- its customers
The endless stream of price changes this year is also having a more subtle negative impact on Tesla. For many years, the company distinguished itself from traditional automakers by not discounting its cars. As a result, customers could feel confident that they were getting a fair price when buying a Tesla, even though they were shelling out a lot of cash.



Today, with prices seeming to change every month -- sometimes dramatically -- customers don't know what the ""fair"" price is for any given Tesla vehicle. One recent repeat buyer was furious after Tesla staff urged him to buy his fully loaded Model 3 before the federal electric vehicle tax credit fell by $1,875 on July 1. He followed their advice -- but then Tesla cut the price of his car by more than $6,000 last week.
In the short run, highlighting an upcoming tax credit drop to drive sales and then cutting prices shortly after the tax credit declines to boost sales further is actually a clever way to sell more cars. But in the long run, the effects might not be so positive. In addition to angering customers who find that they overpaid, Tesla is confusing potential future buyers about what to expect with regard to pricing.
This could hurt sales in two ways. Potential buyers who expect further price cuts may hold out for those price cuts to materialize before ordering a vehicle. The expectation that prices will keep falling will also hurt trade-in values and drive up lease rates for Teslas.


Tesla needs to slow down
Falling battery costs and increasing economics of scale should allow Tesla to reduce its costs over time -- perhaps quite significantly. The company's ongoing moves to streamline its vehicle lineup will also reduce its costs by simplifying production. As a result, in the long run, Tesla should be able to turn a profit even with lower prices.
However, Tesla appears to be cutting prices too quickly relative to its cost reductions. Moreover, it has turned pricing into a game, which could confuse potential customers and even anger people who valued the company's no-haggle pricing policy. As a result, Tesla still has more work to do to stabilize its business.”

tl;dr : Tesla is increasing and decreasing prices and options on cars at a rapid rate, confusing and angering customers. Dropping prices could lead to more production but less earnings in the short term, but more gains in the long run (if they remain stable)



My thoughts are that Elon Musk loves the Tesla company and with the money he is making from SpaceX contracts to be able to build Starlink, Neuralink, The Boring Company and still have time for the OpenAI and the HyperLoop program, I’m in no doubt that he fill fund Tesla if worse comes to worst.

I’m long TSLA but this week we may see a downward trend. Thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,What are my best loan options at 19 years old?,"I’m trying to get some advice for my future plans. Me and my partner are planning to get a travel trailer and truck to tow it with and live in full time. I’m 19, and have been building my credit since the day I turned 18. I’m looking for advice on if I could get approved and what my best options would be for borrowing money. 
 
 I currently have 4 credit cards, one secured through capital one, Discover student IT card, USAA AMEX cash back rewards, and target red card. I also have a auto loan for 20k. I got the car for my mom, who’s going through a bankruptcy, she sends me the money every month for the loan, but the loan is in my name and co-signed by my grandmother. I trust my mom, she’s always paid her auto payments on time for years, but got caught up in credit card debt. The loan is 5 months old now, through USAA. The interest rate is high, 14%. I tried to refinance through my local credit union, but my loan to value was at 108% and that my employment history hasn’t been the longest (continuous with the same employer), and that I’ll need to wait 12 months. That was 4 months ago.  
 
 
The current things holding my back are my inquiries. When the credit union pulled my report I was at 18 inquiries only 9 months after turning 18. I’ve since had no inquiries and haven’t applied for anything. I’m great with using my cards and paying them off on time and trying to stay below 20% utilization. My credit score is at 692 through Experian 665 trans union 658 Equifax (from credit Karma).  
 
I currently owe 3k on my car I drive currently, however this is to my grandma not a bank. I cannot sell or trade in my car until I pay her off and she signs the title. My current car cannot tow a camper trailer. I’m looking used for both the camper and vehicle to haul it with. My goal is to stay under $16k between the two. Our lease is up with my mom in November and she’ll be going to an apartment. By then we plan to have saved $6,000 in cash. So probably needing a loan for around $10k. 

 
However my questions are, what are my best options. Personal loan, auto loan, RV loan? I was thinking personal loan because I would be able to buy a vehicle without paying for full coverage insurance, and would be able to shop more freely and easily. However my chances of getting approved for an unsecured personal loan don’t seem too high. At the same time, I don’t know if I could get approved for a second auto loan, my debt to income ratio is nearing high because of the auto loan of 20k for my mom.  
 
What would be my best options here? Oh and my partners credit is horrible. So nothing is going to get approved with his name on it. Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Personal Loan to Pay Down Mortgage Principal?,"I saw a video a while back advocating getting a personal loan and using it to pay mortgage principal. You would then be making personal loan payments in addition to mortgage payments, but this would theoretically save you money in the long run vs. putting that same (personal loan) payment amount as a principal payment each month. In other words that large, single principal payment should save you more on compound mortgage interest vs the extra you pay in the form of personal loan interest. 

How does the math work on that? Is there just some personal loan interest rate threshold that makes sense, or does it always make (or not) make sense?",finance
personalfinance,Financial Planning for an international couple,"My husband (28, American) and I (26, German) are currently living in Germany. My husband is ex military and now works a federal job for the US military and finishes his Bachelor Degree using his GI Bill. I just finished my first year working, after graduating with my M.Sc.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to my husband's main income being the GI Bill Housing allowance, our monthly income is rather variable, but on average would look like the following:

&amp;#x200B;

* My net salary (monthly): 2800 Euro (3140 USD) - I gross around 55.500 EUR (61k USD) a year but taxes etc. are rather high
* Husband's job: (1400 USD)
* GI Bill (1400 USD)
* VA disability (around 650 USD)

**Total = 6590 USD**

&amp;#x200B;

Our equity:

* My husband has been contributing to his 401k, although it's not much (like 100 USD + employer match)
* Savings husband on a HYSA @2.1%: around 5,000 USD
* Stocks husband: currently worth about  11,000 USD
* My savings: 3,500 USD (building it up again after paying for the car last year and paying three months rent deposit for our new apartment this year)
* My stocks: around 4,000 USD

**Total: 23,500 USD**

&amp;#x200B;

Between the two of us we save around 2000 USD each month (mostly my husband because I pay all the monthly bills that are due in Euro (Rent 1,500 Euro, internet 50 Euro etc.).

Considering our age, I feel like we are not in a too bad place. We do not have any debt and I am big on keeping it that way.

We have two paid off cars, although one being rather old. We have agreed that we actually do not need a second car once the old one breaks down (I take public transport to work and grocery stores etc. are all in walking/biking distance).

&amp;#x200B;

My husband is not really much concerned about finances, however, I feel like we are missing a plan, especially since we do not know if we will move to the US eventually (at least for a few years) or if we stay in Germany.  We feel like in Germany, we would never be able to buy a house as prices in our area start at around 670,000 USD for a simple one in the suburbs. However, in the US I would have to adjust to not having public health care (with no deductibles and co-payments), not having 30 days of paid vacation and the general financial security that Germany provides.

Bitcoin,Discussion on Saifedeans BitTorrent comparrison,"Saifedean made the point recently that the biggest threat to Bitcoin is probably its self. BitTorrent became extremely popular because the music industry was stagnant, outdated and favored record labels much more than the artists and producers. BitTorrent challenged each of these inadequacies by making it exceptionally easy to share any music at little to no cost. This pressure forced the music industry to drastically adapt or face extinction. Fast forward to today, and we have great streaming content services like Spotify, YouTube, Netflix available at very fair prices. As such, use of BitTorrent has dropped dramatically. The threat of its potential usage, in the background, has forced a large degree of inefficiencies out of the marketplace. But as a consequence, BitTorrent has rendered itself much less significant.

&amp;#x200B;

Could the same thing happen with Bitcoin ?

Will the mere fact that it exists force the existing monetary system to radically overhaul? Will it drive the same efficiencies out of the marketplace, and will we end up with a new generation of financial / monetary tools, that function so much more productively that Bitcoin becomes almost irrelevant, serving as little more than a background threat to the possibility of future corruption?

So my wife and I consolidated our high-interest credit card debt into a personal loan of about $30k last year.  There's \~$22k remaining on that loan with an interest rate of 7.49% (daily simple interest calculation) and monthly payments of $601.

Does it make sense to cash out $20k worth of bonds now to pay off the majority of the personal loan now?  I could pull some money out of our savings (we have about $8k) to make up the rest of the payoff for the loan or just continue with the $601 regular payments since it would be paid off rather quickly after dumping $20k into it.

The next interest accrual on the bonds is in October and would be \~$400 dollars more in value of the bonds I would need to cash.  Does it make sense to wait until October to cash in on the bonds?",finance

personalfinance,Getting Tax Money For Raffle Prize Car,"I recently entered a non-profit organization's raffle for a car giveaway, and it got me thinking about how to pay for it all if I did happen to win something like that (So this is just a hypothetical question...I haven't won anything yet). 

&amp;#x200B;

The ""official rules"" of the raffle state that the winner must pay, to the organization for the purpose of withholding, the federal and state taxes *before* they are allowed to claim the prize. For the car they're giving away, this would be approximately $16,500 in federal and state tax. There is no cash prize option, and if you decline to pay the tax withholding and take delivery of the car they will pass you over and draw more names until they find someone who will pay.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, like most millennials I don't exactly have a spare $16k burning a hole in my pocket. So I guess ultimately it comes down to a simple banking question that I can't find a specific answer to online for a raffle situation: **Can I get a secured auto loan against the prize car to pay the income taxes on a ""free"" car that was won? Or would I be stuck getting a much higher interest unsecured personal loan since I'm not ""buying"" the car with the loan money, just paying income tax on a ""free"" car?** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd probably keep the car if I could do a secured auto loan at 3-4%, but if I could only do an unsecured loan (at 10%+) due to the odd circumstances of the transaction I'd probably just immediately sell it, pay off that loan, and keep the rest of the cash.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

"" Unless you direct your payment to an individual loan or group, the standard allocation method is as follows. After your current amount due is paid, payments are allocated across loans in repayment status starting with the highest interest rate. Once the loans in repayment status with the highest interest rate are paid in full, any remaining payment amount will be allocated across the loans with the next highest interest rate. If two or more loans in repayment status have the same highest interest rate, the payment will be allocated first to the unsubsidized loans and then to the subsidized loans, in proportion to each loan’s regular monthly payment amount.

&amp;#x200B;

When you pay more than your current amount due, your due date on loan groups in repayment status will advance by one month each time you satisfy the regular monthly payment amount for that group. Your monthly billing statement will show $0 due for that loan group. ""

* Do nothing and pay off car at current rate and pay off in two years. 
* Refinance to a lower monthly rate and a longer term (their preference). They intend to use the difference to go toward emergency fund and credit card debit (over 10,000). 
* Sell car to match loan (if possible exceed the loan) and buy a cheaper less model/smaller car and thus have a lower payment and less cost of ownership.",finance

datascience,Best feature extraction/selection strategy for k-mer based protein classification,"I've tried a lot of things - binary features, count vector features, TF-IDF, TF-IDF followed by PCA, binary features followed by chi-squared feature selection. Nothing seems to increase the accuracy beyond 0.55 (accuracy because the dataset is perfectly balanced atm for debugging purposes). In all cases, the final feature vector is usually about 512 in size and is fed to a random forest (which should be pretty robust to hyper params, but the #trees is 100, #features/tree and #samples/tree are 0.33, and other combinations were tried too).

I think the main issue is k-mer selection. For now I am just considering the top 10k kmers that occur in most sequences and using those in my binary/count/TF-IDF vocabulary. The rest are ignored.

Is there a better way to do this? Any help would be appreciated. Also, over fitting on a small sample works. So the code is probably not wrong.

I've heard widely differing opinions on this. My father and myself tend to think that 20% is entirely worth it in our situation. We would still have a cushion of around $40,000 to use as an emergency fund or invest after the purchase which I feel totally comfortable with. I am extremely frugal, as is my fiance. So I don't see us getting into trouble with running out of a liquid asset cushion. Plus, we avoid PMI, have more equity in the home if the market declines soon, and a lower interest rate plus less fees. 

My realtor and a few others have recommended a 7 year ARM, and have said that you will make more money in the long run simply investing the money you would have spent on the down payment in the market after you take care of PMI, etc. I don't like this strategy personally because it assumes that the market will continue to surge in the near future.

Age: 25
Income: 38k today, August 5th I’m changing jobs and will be at 60k plus $700/month in vehicular allowance. 
Credit: 480-something. 
Current Bills per month:
Rent-$750
Phone-$130 
Other Misc Bills-$120

Checking:
$1,000
Savings:
$1,100
No retirement. 

Credit Breakdown:
2 Inquiries
6 Accounts
4 Derogatory Remarks. 

As you can see above my income level is about to skyrocket. I am very fortunate and understand that with relatively low expenses. What it also means is that I NEED to purchase a vehicle. My job will have me driving locally for about 60% of the week. 

I started putting out feelers because I know getting a vehicle is going to be an extremely expensive endeavor. I had a dealer quote me something that equates to around 35% APR on a 4 Year term. I told them to just forget it since I didn’t need it at the time. (90 days ago). 

What are my options outside of that?
I can almost certainly get a co-signer but when I was looking at used loans previously I was declined with a co-signer with pretty great credit (784 IIRC). I didn’t want to ring up his credit any more so I put the brakes on until I could rebuild my credit a little more. I have an active account with PENFED as well but as I said, I don’t want to apply with a co-signer unless the odds of approval are high. 


Let me be clear:
I am taking the financial steps to rebuild my credit. The timing is just a little off for me to wait. It’s not an option. 

I also have accepted that this might just end up being a situation where I have to bite the bullet and pay more for this vehicle because of my past actions.

It seems if we can purchase a potentially appreciating asset, we could benefit from the sale of it in a few years instead of using our money on rent, which we would not be building equity with.

I understand where everyone is coming from when it comes to not buying a house with someone you are not planning on being married to. This is something that will only happen down the road and most likely after I have been married. I live in a very large city in the Midwest, with a high cost of living. I would definitely be more interested in a duplex to rent out the other half while I live in the other, so that is something I will look into. I understand that the costs associated with owning a home will be much higher than just the mortgage payment, so those costs would definitely be calculated to see if owning would be a better decision than renting.

personalfinance,To Mortgage or Not to Mortgage,"My wife and I have purchased a lot (with cash) and are currently in the process of working with a homebuilder. We have home designs close to being finalized, and are a few months away from starting construction. The construction cost will likely be somewhere around $900,000.  


The decision I've been wrestling with is whether to take out a mortgage, pay cash, or a combination thereof. Paying cash would essentially wipe out our savings but, if all goes well, we'll be able to replenish in the coming years. Taking out a mortgage would allow us to take advantage of historically low interest rates, and also has tax advantages. However, it seems foolish to borrow money at a higher interest rate and have savings sitting at a lower interest rate. I also find the idea of speculating in higher risk investments to try and get a better ROI than the mortgage interest rate dangerous. That strategy works until it doesn't.  


My current tentative plan is to go with something like a no closing cost 10 year 3/1 ARM and pay it down aggressively. This should give us a liquidity buffer, and also the most competitive interest rates. I'd love to hear what people think. Thanks in advance for any input.",finance

&gt;  
&gt;The largest-ever settlement for a data breach draws to a close multiple probes into Equifax by the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and nearly all state attorneys general. It also resolves pending class-action lawsuits against the company.  
&gt;  
&gt;**“This companys ineptitude, negligence, and lax security standards endangered the identities of half the U.S. population,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Equifax**, one of three major credit-reporting companies, **disclosed in 2017 that a data breach had compromised the personal information, including Social Security numbers, of 143 million Americans.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The scandal upended the company, which saw the exit of its chief executive, as its security practices and slow speed in disclosing the breach were challenged. Washington policymakers questioned how private companies could amass so much personal data, setting off efforts to bolster consumers’ ability to protect and control their information.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Under the settlement, the company will establish a $300 million restitution fund for harmed consumers that could climb to $425 million depending on its use. Consumers eligible for the fund must submit claims showing they were fraud victims or set up credit-monitoring services following the breach.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Equifax will also pay a $175 million fine to the states and $100 million to the CFPB.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Affected consumers will also be eligible for 10 years of free credit monitoring from Equifax, and the company agreed to make it easier for consumers to freeze their credit or dispute inaccurate information in credit reports.  
&gt;  
&gt;The company has also agreed to bolster its security practices and have its policies assessed regularly by a third party.

 I filed my tax return on time and now I received letters from the IRS. I get a refund from the state for $147 (with the check and all) and another letter from the IRS saying I owe them $304.54 ($297 plus some fees because I havent been at home and wasnt able to check my mail).

personalfinance,Transfer to Ally not showing up as taken away from other account?,"Just as the title says. I was fed up with getting horrid rates at my primary bank so I just opened an Ally HYSA and scheduled a transfer from my primary to Ally. Got an email today from Ally saying that I’d need to put money into that account in the next few weeks or it would be closed due to inactivity. All makes sense. 

The thing is, is that my Ally app shows the money as in the account. It transferred last night. However, it’s not showing as transferred from my other savings account. 

TL;DR: Ally says there’s no money in the account via email, app says there is, but also not taken from my other savings account that I’m transferring from. Is this normal? I’m happy to wait a day or two if so, but if it’s not I’d like to get to the bottom of it! Thanks in advance.",finance

I should have had everything paid off last year but unfortunately things slipped up and got a little out of hand.

I’m now have approx. $15k in credit card debt and my mental health is back in check! I’ve set a strict budget and I should be on track to pay off all 3 credit cards within a year give or take. These credit cards are at approx. 23% APR so obviously I’m also paying a fair amount of interest.

personalfinance,In collection but not reported?,"Hi everyone!

I want to preface this by saying thank you in advance for reading and helping my situation. Please let me know if I should post this in another subreddit where I can be better helped if this is not the correct one.

In 2006, I took out a private student loan of $16k by a private company who has since sold it to another company. I was able to defer payments on it while in school, however somehow I ended up defaulting and therefore was sent to collections. The first collections company eventually also sold it twice more now to a different debt collector, called NES TSI Trust. Due to interest rates, etc, the amount I owe was nearly $32k.

I had been paying minimum amount of this loan up until about 20 months ago, when they decided to call me and demand the account be paid in full. Because I didn’t have the money, they made me agree to a deal where I had to use my CC to make a $7k payment and increase my monthly payments to $200 here on out. This will go on until maybe another few months before they contact me again to ask for more money.

Here is the problem. I have checked credit karma and didn’t see a reporting of this. I read somewhere that I should check all 3 of my credit reports (transunion, equifax, experian) and neither this loan nor this collection has been on any of them. 

Can someone please explain what this means? Could I/should I challenge this debt? If so, how? What other options do I have? There's about $26K left.

Please help! Thank you!",finance

investing,Portfolio asset allocation: hedging risk with gold or LT Treasuries?,"Hi guys,

As advocated by a lot of folks here, I've been diligently investing a fixed amount in Stock ETF's every single month

Obviously the return has been great throughout the last few years.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I recently came across this great website right here, which shows a bunch of KPI's on different investment strategies.

[https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/portfolio-matrix/](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/portfolio-matrix/)

I always considered 100% stocks to be the best strategy out there as it **individually** beats any other asset class.

However, as a lot of you probably know, combining the right asset classes limits your risk and gives you (at least) the same return (often better).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I've been using another brilliant site to determine the best portfolio for me (I know, the past is not a guarantee for the future but still...)

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation)

I've decided that I'm probably gonna do something like

\- 75% stock (30% small cap &amp; 45% large cap - diversified across the world)

\- 15% REIT's

\- 10% on an asset to hedge the risk

&amp;#x200B;

On the latter, I'm kinda stuck. I read the article below

[https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/06/26/solving-the-great-diversification-debate-gold-commodities-treasuries-or-reits/](https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/06/26/solving-the-great-diversification-debate-gold-commodities-treasuries-or-reits/)

In summary, Gold is only good when the economy goes bonkers, while LT Treasuries also prove to be a great diversification asset with a bit more consistent performance.

Hence, I'm leaning towards the latter to diversify my portfolio.

However, we all know that bonds/treasury notes go down when interest rates go up.

With the rates at almost an all-time low, I'm unsure whether LT Treasuries are the best way to go.

personalfinance,"Parents are receiving an inheritance, should they pay off house, invest, other?","My parents will be receiving an inheritance shortly and they asked their children for their thoughts on if they should pay off their house (they have a financial advisor, so I think they were just hearing out other ideas).

&amp;#x200B;

My impulse was to just say pay off the house and be done with it, however I know my opinion is influenced from the Dave Ramsey crowd. I know that sometimes these types only have a hammer so they see nails everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

* Both parents are mid 60's, retired, and generally healthy.
* They have a nice pension that they can live on very comfortably. It also has cost of living adjustments built in. If my father passes, my mother gets 50% until she passes. Then nothing.
* They travel a lot. They have a camper that they will drive places with as well as a time share in Cabo. They do cruises and travel to Europe. 2 bigger trips a years with smaller tripes sprinkled through out.
* Their philosophy is to travel as much as they can in the next 10 years while healthy.
* Their house is probably worth around 500k+ and they owe probably around 150k-200k. My guess is that the monthly payment is $1,800 to $2,000. They have refinanced a few times to take cash out for remodels and such. Interest rate is probs around 4%.
* The house is in good shape and is mostly remodeled in the last 10 years.
* They do have non-pension investments, but I can not say how much. My guess is around 100k.
* Their primary focus is to enjoy retirement while healthy and have money for retirement homes and medical care that is inevitable with age. They are not trying to build wealth for the sake of wealth. Very much more focused on responsible consumption.
* The inheritance they will be receiving is likely around 800k net in the bank.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some common advice I hear:**

*""keep the mortgage for the tax write off""*

My understanding is that the interest you are paying is usually greater than the write off.

&amp;#x200B;

*""invest the money instead, because you will get returns greater than the mortgage interest""*

In the long run this may be true, but my parents' have a shorter investment window to sustain the downs that come with the ups. After subtracting the mortgage interest, is the 5ish% returns worth the risk?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The thought behind paying off the house is 1) to reduce risk. If anything happens to the pension or investments, they have a place to live or take equity from that. And 2) increase the monthly cash flow.

&amp;#x200B;

My guess is there is really no wrong choice, they seem to be set up just fine.

personalfinance,Is it time to open a brokerage account?,"Hi all:  I am 40 years old and my husband is 36.  We have a good amount of liquid savings and I'm thinking about opening a basic brokerage account (index funds on Fidelity) to grow our money faster. Hoping to get some input from PF to see if this is the best option.  I've never done any investing outside of my tax-advantaged accounts, so I'm very nervous to pull the trigger.  Our financials breakdown as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

* Annual joint income:  $135,000 (I'm part-time for parenting reasons)
* Roths/IRAs - maxed out annually, retirement is on track
* 401K -  currently contributing 12%, increasing annually until maxed out
* 529 - contributing $5,000 annually, on track for public in-state college (our son is 4)
* No debt other than our mortgage - we still owe $213,000, and our monthly payment is about $1,300, 4.375% interest rate
* Liquid savings between all our accounts:  $131,000 ish?  (we have both joint and personal savings, so I am estimating on his.  These are all in HYS and CDs.)

&amp;#x200B;

Immediate goals:

* House upgrades:  I would like to update our kitchen and bathroom at some point, but we DIY a lot, so I think $20,000 would cover both.
* Husband will probably buy a new car in the next 2-3 years

Vague future goals:

* A new house entirely?  We live in the SF Bay Area and were very lucky to be able to buy when the market bottomed out in 2010.  It's a good house and I would be fine living there forever, but an upgrade would be nice someday.  (However if we want upgrade in the Bay Area this would probably require another catastrophic recession or winning the lotto.)

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is...suppose we put in $15,000 in a brokerage fund now and let it grow, what does that mean for our taxes in the future?  I keep thinking we're going to get screwed on taxes, but maybe we are already screwing ourselves by not investing this money?  Is $15,000 a good starting point for where we are?  Or should we just keep chugging along with our regular savings?

There's a fair amount of unnecessary spending in our budget, but we still manage to save. We're three years out of college, and we've been at this income level for just over a year, so our down payment savings is fairly small. We'll have $40k in liquid savings by January 2020 (with credit scores above 760), and plan to take out a Conventional 97 loan. We're looking at homes in the neighborhood of $350k-370k. Husband's job is stable. Mine is less stable, but is also relatively easy to replace. We may end up waiting until 2021 to purchase (with a liquid savings closer to $65k), but if I'd like to be ready to make an offer beginning in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

The $350-370k range is the cheapest we can find a single family home in our city. Moving \~15 miles from the city center yields home prices closer to $330k, but would incur substantial transportation costs because there is no reliable public transit, and we currently only have one car. Townhomes are available in the $315-340k range. In the long term the townhome vs. single family home prices are nearly a wash, because of a benefit my husband's job offers (see below). My husband has a local union job with a pension and plans to live here for the rest of his life. I may move around for my career, finances permitting, but this will be our home base.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband's employer awards a 5% raise to employees selected for a special assignment. My husband will be eligible in spring 2020, but to receive the assignment he is required to own a single family home (not townhouse). For every year we don't buy a home after 2020, we will miss out on \~$5k in gross income.

b) The three of us becoming co-owners of the house and entering into a ""Joint Tenancy with Right to Survivorship"" situation. I believe this means that if one owner dies, the other two would ""inherit"" the house without needing to go through the probate process, but does it protect the house if one of the owners needs to go to a nursing home?

&amp;#x200B;

c} Setting up an irrevocable trust for the house. This seems to have the advantage of protecting the house from being seized after a period of five years from the establishment of the trust, and of avoiding estate taxes. However, his estate will not be large enough to require us to pay federal or state taxes anyway, and I have read that establishing an irrevocable trust is much more complicated and costlier than establishing a revocable one, and I fear he is likely to need nursing care sooner than five years from now.

&amp;#x200B;

d) Going through with the revocable or irrevocable trust and finding a way to pay a little more each month in order to take out disability insurance on him. How expensive is disability insurance on somebody like my father as I have described him?

This is my first post, and I have just started to become aware of the intricacies of financial management, so I apologize if I have not provided enough information or am venturing too far into the realm of asking for legal advice.

personalfinance,Should I get the extended warranty on the used car I just bought?,"Bought a 2005 Honda Accord with 42k miles. Refinanced to get a lower interest rate with the local credit union (Wells Fargo got me with 14.49 percent and the credit union hooked me up with 3.6... enough said on that) and they actually offered me an extended warranty. Which kinda blew my mind considering how old the car is. 

My loan is for $6400 for 36 months, the warranty is $1100 for 48 months/60k miles of coverage. And that's 60k miles on top of what it already has so I'd be covered till 100k miles or so. They can attach it to my monthly payment bringing it to $220 a month or after my loan is paid the last 6 months they'll let me pay it off then for $180. If something goes wrong that's not regular wear and tear I only have to pay a $100 deductible (this is the ""platinum"" package that covers pretty much everything).

This is a granny car, garage kept and well maintained. Taken to a dealer every 6 months wince 2005 and detailed according to the carfax. I'm leaning towards the warranty and paying it off at the end of the loan period. I know extended warranties are just pure margin and I'm wondering if this is a sound investment and if most of you would do it.",finance

personalfinance,"At this point should I just move back home? $26k in loans, $35k salary","A little backstory: I am 22 and graduated in December 2018 with a degree in marketing and recently started a full time job after having done an internship this past spring. The job pays $30k for the first 3 months, then $35k for the next 3, then $40k until promoted (likely about a year).

I have ~$26k in student loans that are a mix of private and federal and result in ~$300 a month in payments currently (while paying the minimum). I’m currently paying $425 a month in rent but that’s about to go up to $725. I really try to reduce other costs, but spend at least ~$100/month for public transportation and around $160/month on groceries.

I currently live in a major city, but if needed can move home to a small city in the Midwest to live with my parents. I would likely be able to get a job that pays $35k and would essentially have no expenses, which would allow me to make a significant dent in my loans. However, I’m worried that moving home will make me complacent and isolated, and unlikely or harder to return to a major city. 

If anyone has any similar experiences or thoughts I’d appreciate it!

Edit: Thank you everyone for the input. Some additional info: the job at home would actually be a bigger name company (I’m currently at a small firm in dc and the one at home is one of the offices of a huge company). However, it’s true that there isn’t nearly as much opportunity otherwise in my hometown.

Edit 2: Wow, I did not expect this many responses. Thank you for everyone who took the time to give their input! Some additional details (not that I really expect anyone to care lol, but because people have asked):

-The current job is technically in PR rather than marketing, which might help to explain the lower salary. I actually turned down several other offers that paid significantly more, because they both were in NYC and I really didn’t want to move there. I also accepted this job as opposed to the others (which were more of an analyst/data analytics role) because I wanted something more creative and less of staring at spreadsheets all day. However, I’m also considering moving away from business all together in the next few years to pursue something more people-oriented such as being a counselor or speech language pathologist, which is why going home to pay off loans quickly is a consideration.",finance

personalfinance,Leaving a job and having to pay them back for tuition. Options?,"I may be leaving my current job after they paid for my tuition (about 20k). The stipulations were that if you leave before a certain amount of time then you have to pay back everything they paid for. Well I was offered a much better position outside of the company, and I want to take it. 


What are my options for paying back my current employer? Thought about a personal loan but the interest rates on those are insane. I'm not even sure how my company is going to ask for it back. They can't expect someone to pay it all back at once can they? 


What are some options I could consider in order to pay them back? Maybe a low interest credit card? Not sure if there are any cards that have a limit that high though


Edit,
Another option I just thought of is dipping into my retirement with my current company to pay them back. Will I get taxed heavily on that? I'm still in my 20's.

personalfinance,Credit Unions are overrated?,"Why do people sing the praises of credit unions so much?

I understand they are owned by their members which should  align their interests with account holders. However they seem to be just as consumer unfriendly as the big banks.

&amp;#x200B;

For Example, I looked at the rates and fees for my neighborhood credit unions.

They all had a laundry list of fees for overdraft, minimum balance, out-of-network ATM use, bill pay, transferring money, using Co-op network ATM more than twice a month, and so on.  They also paid almost nothing on deposits.

&amp;#x200B;

Contrast that with an online checking account from Ally, Discover, Simple, and FDIC insured brokerage accounts from Sofi Money, Fidelity Cash Management. They charge almost no fees or structure their fees to be consumer friendly (Ally limits overdraft fees to 1). They all pay better interest rates, and they have a large network of Free ATMs or even reimburse fees.

Why would someone ever recommend a credit union as their primary account over these online accounts?

personalfinance,"Pay down student loan (low interest), invest, or save?","Good evening, 

First of all, I know I am fortunate to be in the position I am in right now, but I am at a loss for the best course of action. 

27, Michigan

I have a student loan ($171k starting balance) that I have been aggressively paying down, with a current balance of $48k. I started paying this loan in May of 2015, so I have paid off $122k in principal, and $145k overall in just over 4 years. The current interest rate on this loan is very low at 2.9% variable. 

This, of course has taken a significant portion of my discretionary income. I have been fortunate to work in a field that has high pay, and the company I previously worked for had essentially unlimited overtime, so (up until this year) I had been working to the legal maximum. 

I am fortunate to have been hired by my dream employer, and will be in a very good financial situation for the remainder of my career, barring any significant health problems or the death of a Fortune 100 company with 5.5 billion in income a year (very unlikely). My income went down a bit for this first year with the new job but will catch up quickly. 

The company contributes 16% direct contribution to my 401k without any personal contribution required. I had been contributing 10% with a 3% match at my old employer. As of now I am not contributing any additional money to my 401k above the 16%. I do contribute $100 a month towards an HSA, and the company contributes $800 a year towards that as well. I also have a free $950k life insurance policy, and additional insurance benefits as well. 

I currently share an apartment with my two roommates in order to save money, but am planning on getting into a house/condo next fall. 

Here are my additional financial details:

Salary (pre overtime): ~100K this year, ~140k next year, ~190k year 3, ~200k year 4, increasing every year until my earnings max out at (current rates) of ~400k minimum. I am unionized, so pay rates will likely increase (or may decrease if company is in financial trouble) over the course of my career. 

Current savings: 40k in 401k, $15,000 in a high-yield 2.4% savings ($10k emergency fund, $5k additional), $13k in Betterment, $4k in Robinhood. Total savings: ~$72k.

Current expenses: $200/month car loan (paid off next year, 3%), $550 a month for rent/utilities, $100 insurance, variable food expenses (travel for work, so paid a per diem for food on the road), $500 to savings, $500 to Betterment, $2500 minimum towards my student loans (averaged $5,000 a month in 2018, $3,000 a month this year)

___

So the question is where to put my additional income. I want to keep paying down my student loan for the psychological benefit of being out of that debt, plus the ability to get a better deal on a mortgage without the impact to my D-I. Yet, part of me believes that paying it down so aggressively when it has such a low interest rate might not be the best idea. 

Retirement... The 16% DC should have me set for retirement, but I do have the ability to contribute additional money on top of that. The only thing that concerns me is most financial sites advise having 1x your salary saved by 30. I don't think there is any possible way for me to get from 40k in 401k to 200k by 30. I feel like this advice may not be applicable due to the high salary and large increases/salary way above COL? 

Savings... Looking at condos in the $250-$300k price range. Do I start saving more for that down payment (currently have $22k between betterment/savings/Robinhood), or instead keep paying down that student loan to decrease debt? I also promised myself a stupid car I shouldn't buy (probably Audi A4) if I get my dream job, but that won't be until I can pay cash for it down the road. 


I know these are silly problems to have, but i am really at a loss of what might be the best course of action to tackle my situation.",finance
personalfinance,"Financial Analyst moving out of NJ in the next few weeks, what's next?","I graduated a little over a year ago with a degree in Finance.

After graduating, I received a job offer and moved to New Jersey, and I've been working in financial planning and analysis for a Fortune 500 company, overseeing a few of our spin-off businesses (internal start-ups/recent acquisitions), creating forecasts and budgets, and working with my team to review the results each month. I'm lucky to have held this job, but it's clear that it's not something for me long term.

My gross salary is ~$67k/yr, with a potential for a small bonus. After insurance premiums, my take home is around $4k/mo.

My current budget stands at roughly:

* $1,550 for 1/2 the rent of a 2br apartment.
* ~$90/mo for my share of the utilities/cable.
* ~$400-500/mo for food, which can be scaled down if needed.
* $290/mo for student loans.
* $140/mo for car related expenses, including gas, parking ($60), and insurance.
* $300 towards my 401k, with a 100% company match up to 6%
* The remainder is invested, with the exception of ~$600-1.2k vacations about 2-3 times per year.
* In total, I have around $26-28k in savings (largely invested in index funds, some in my 401k, some in a bank with decent interest rates)

I'll be blunt and say I'm disheartened by the state of New Jersey. Some areas are beautiful, but I'm on the outskirts of NYC in the industrial side and I miss the lack of traffic, scenery, and ability to go kayaking or hike, similar to where I'm originally from, farther South..

I have coworkers that commute 3.5 to 4 hours per day, and with my roommate moving out, and my disinterest in the area, I see moving elsewhere as an alternative that will make me happier.

With my rough familiarity with Python/Microsoft Office/technical software from my current role, my goal is to create a small consulting business that focuses on process automation for small businesses. It's in its infancy, and I'm tweaking the website, but I'll be moving elsewhere to pursue this business/project for 12-18 months. If I'm not able to grow this business to cover my monthly costs, I'll head back to a corporate job in an area I enjoy more.

I understand that this would largely deplete my savings if I'm not able to attract clients. I'm aiming towards ~$1.2 to ~1.6k in expenses per month, and reaching out for both budgeting and location suggestions.

I'd aim towards:

* $600-$750/mo for rent
* $130/mo for cable/utilities
* $200-250/mo on food
* $290/mo on student loan repayment
* Health insurance can be covered by my parents, as I'm under 26.
* $50-100 for other discretionary, like toiletries and 'fun stuff' (movie tickets, the occasional concert)

How do I appropriately manage my time and expenses, and would you have any less expensive location suggestions (San Antonio, Tucson, Little Rock seem plausible--but I'm not married to anywhere)?",finance

After 3 years of renting and bearing with the unconventional living situations that our apartment had made us endure with (constant water outages and plumbing issues, infestations), I feel it is time to move into my first home. I feel ready but I'm not sure if I am financially ready. Personally, I dont see the benefit in buying a house right now, I'm very worried the I'll make the wrong move on a 284k home and I'll be fucked. I don't know jack shit about purchasing a home, getting the best interest rates, loans, PMI, etc. I feel so lost.... My fiancé wants to very badly move to a house and almost seems as though she doesn't care as much as me. It seems as though she's ready to settle with anything that is nice.  

With that being said, we plan on living in this home 3-5 years, maybe even longer depending on our careers. Currently, I have a stable job and luckily no debt to my name. The price of the houses around the area that are decent are around 285-320. I'm leaning towards 285 and if its lower...even better.

Also, I have no idea whether a 30 or 15 year mortgage would be better for my situation and whether a conventional or FHA loan would be better . \~*overwhelming*\~ With the sheer amount of information about purchasing a home, I can see that I can easily overlook a crucial process that would be detrimental to me....even worse miss something that would benefit me.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,"Graduating college in a year, no credit card, where do I start?","I’m 20 (USA) and will be graduating college in a little less than a year. I’ll have around $35,000 in debt when I’m done, and beginning job prospects in the field I want to go in typically start at about $60,000/yr. 

No one in my life had ever taught me about finances, and my parents ruined their lives with credit card debt. Basically they’re very anti-credit cards now and don’t understand that I need one so I can sign a lease and such when I graduate. Anytime I ask them questions about credit cards they immediately shut me down, so I’ve just never bothered to get one since I figured it’s better to not have one than to have one and have no idea how to use it responsibly. 

While in college I make about $800 a month with a part time job, $100 of that goes to student loans already, $400 goes to rent (sublease with no credit check), and the last $300 is for food, public transportation, and fun stuff or other expenses that pop up. I don’t really have a savings. I also don’t have a car. 
The $100/mo student loan payments is through a private company, the rest of my loans are a mix of federal subsidized and unsubsidized that I’m not required to make payments on until 6 months out of school. 

I know I’m an adult and can just go apply for a credit card but I have no idea how it works and how to use it properly. If I get a credit card now, will one year of proper use be long enough to have decent enough credit to sign a lease when I graduate? Or sign a car loan? If 730 is good credit, what number do you start at? Is it 0? My $100 a month student loan payment is through my mom as a co-signer, and every few months I’m a day or two late on the payment because I’ll get paid a day or two after it’s due. Has this affected my credit when I don’t even have a credit card yet?

personalfinance,Student loan payoff negotiation-USA,"Hey PF, 

My wife and I are selling our first house and moving back home. We did really well with this house, and part of our strategy is to take some cash out of the deal and payoff her student loans. Originally high interest government loans, now refinanced via PenFed. They payoff is about 48,500 right now. Is there any way to negotiate this number? Is there any incentive for the lender to work with us on this? We are ready and willing to pay the full number, but I always try to get a better deal if possible.",finance
personalfinance,Trying to buy a home but not sure what to do,"My girlfriend and I have been looking for a home for the last 6 months or so and are a little frustrated with the market currently. We have found countless homes only to be told by our realtor that they have already accepted an offer, some within hours of listing. We have been to 30+ showings only to be disappointed by the actual vs the photos. We are getting tired of looking because we can't seem to find a place that checks all our needed boxes without sacrificing too many of our wants. We feel like we are doing well enough that we shouldn't have to settle too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial information:**

We live in New England for reference of housing costs. We are both 24 years old with a combined gross income of \~ 85-90k depending on my overtime. We have a total of about 65k saved up in an online savings account that will only increase the longer we look for a home (we save about 700 a week combined). We both own our cars with little to no debt at all and live at home with our parents. I live rent free while she has to pay about 500 a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Housing information:**

Our initial budget was 230k but once we actually dove into the home buying process we increased it to 270k with a \~3.8% interest rate. We plan on putting about 10% down to keep a decent chunk left for furniture, emergency savings and potential car purchases. We wanted something big enough to grow a family in but not too big that we wouldn't utilize the space now (3 beds). We also want something structurally move in ready, meaning we don't mind changing out cosmetic things (floors, cabinets, paint. We basically don't want to knock down walls and change the layouts or structure. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Our options:**

So currently we have a few options in mind. We can either keep aggressively looking and hopefully find something that meets our needs and some, if not most of our wants, or we could wait until the spring and keep saving up money. By my calculations we would have approximately 90k saved up if we waited until the spring (April). If we do go that route our budget would increase to possibly 300k with the extra money we could put down (20%) and avoid PMI. If we do wait until the spring we will casually look around, but we wont be spending 8 hours a day looking like we do now. More like a quick check every afternoon to make sure nothing slips by.  

&amp;#x200B;

**A few questions:**

Is our budget too low? Is it too high? How much should we really put down? Do we have enough saved up? Is renting a better option?

Thank goodness I did purchase it as within 6 months of my purchase the transmission went out and needed to be replaced. The $3,000.00 warranty of course got paid before the car and I still owe $4,000.00 on the loan and of course the car is literally falling apart.

This doesn't change the fact that I need a car to get to work and I can't afford payments and insurance on 2 cars. It has been suggested to me that I let the bank repossess the car and try to get another before that process is complete but the only place I can get a car would more than likely be a high risk dealership that charges high interest rates. I have no savings to buy from an individual and no resources to borrow from. Thoughts on the idea of repossession? I hate the idea but am in a real bind with options.

personalfinance,Affording the Nursing Home,"In search of financial/legal advice. Here's the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

The state is Minnesota. Grandmother (85) and Grandfather (86) have lived together with my Mother for the past 5+ years. Grandmother and Grandfather own their own home and are listed together on the deed. Grandmother + Grandfather have income from Social Security + pension totaling around $6,000 per month. We aren't certain about bank balance, investments, and other liquid assets.

&amp;#x200B;

Grandmother has developed Alzheimer's/dementia. Disease has progressively grown worse to the point of being unmanagable. Situation is causing tremendous hardship/stress. The family has hired a care worker to visit on weekdays and attend to Grandmother's needs, but even so it's increasingly untenable. There are safety issues with Grandmother being unattended, and there is a constant paranoia that she might wander out of the home in the middle of the night. She basically requires constant supervision and that isn't something we're equipped to provide. We need to get her into a nursing home.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheapest nearby nursing home is $5,000 per month. Some as high as $8,000. My understanding is Medicare won't pay, Medicaid would but they would need to declare bankruptcy to qualify.

&amp;#x200B;

Question is, what is the best way to get Grandmother into a nursing home with minimum out-of-pocket whilst also protecting the house from being taken away from them? Are there state/federal programs we should be aware of? What are our options?

Bitcoin,‘Intellectuals yet idiots’: RT’s Keiser Report tests theory about central bankers,"Irresponsible central bankers are at the root of many problems.  

Our fiat currency based global financial system is broken.  

Bitcoin is part of the solution.

[https://www.rt.com/shows/keiser-report/464820-interest-rates-sovereign-debt/](https://www.rt.com/shows/keiser-report/464820-interest-rates-sovereign-debt/)  

&amp;#x200B;

The use of ultra-low interest rates and bond-buying programs by the world’s major central banks including the ECB, BOJ and the Federal Reserve has pushed the total amount of debt with yields below zero to a record of $13 trillion.  

RT’s Keiser Report discusses the issue with Chris Martenson of [PeakProsperity.com](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2FPeakProsperity.com) who says *“central bankers are really intellectuals yet idiots.”*   

They make completely ridiculous statements and are not questioned or challenged at all, according to Martenson.  

*“They are able to say completely dumb stuff… It’s kind of listen what the king says that he is wearing clothes when he is just totally naked.*  

&amp;#x200B;

The economic researcher told Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert: *“You know, it’s just ridiculous that the Federal Reserve can’t just own up to the fact that it is the proud owner of the largest wealth and income gaps in all our history.”*  

He stressed that $13 trillion of negative yielding debt is *“guaranteed losses, it’s not even like you have to wait till infinity to get your returns, you will never get your money back from those.”*",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Pay off CC debt at 0% interest or student loans?,"I currently have ~$11K each in both CC debt and private student loans (federal is another story). I recently transferred my CC debt to various balance transfer cards so that none of it is collecting interest (this is good, right?). Does it make more sense for me at this point to knock out as much student loan debt as possible before the 0% APR ends and just keep getting new balance transfer cards, or should I for some reason knock out the credit cards first? The student loans are at ~7.5%.  

Perhaps the better question is: is there any reason that I shouldn't just keep getting balance transfer cards? I feel like it's a strategy that makes sense but something about it just...feels sketchy? Like continually moving money around isn't a viable strategy, but I'm still slowly paying it down, not putting more on the cards, and not collecting interest. Am I smart or am I the dum? For some reason the credit card debt just scares me more than the student loans even though they're just about the same amounts.

Edit for more info:  
Credit score was ~680 before getting the two BT cards with credit limits of 3500 and 9000. So I'll get a hit for the credit check and average life of accounts but will get a boost with the debt ratio.

I'm currently paying $200 on my private loans per month, and about $180 on CC debt. Have not looked much into refinancing tbh.

APRs will rise to 20% and 18% in 18 and 21 months, respectively. However, the CC I'm transferring FROM has an APR of 14%, so if no BT cards are available after the promo period is up, I can transfer them back to the original card at the lower interest rate. It's not ideal but it's an option.

personalfinance,Calculating mortgage payoff date/interest with variable rate?,"This is more of a curiosity question than anything really important. Currently I'm using an app called ""Payoff Track"" to keep track of my mortgage payments. You input the loan amount, interest rate, term, payments per year, and start date. It calculates scheduled interest and regular payment. If you input extra principle payments it then keeps track of how much extra you've payed, your new expected payoff date, and the reduced expected total interest paid. It's a spiffy little app.

Our mortgage is somewhat atypical as it is a 15/15 ARM. That is, halfway through the 30 year term it will readjust the rate through the magical interest rate formulas, and keep that rate for the second half of the loan. This makes me a bit nervous since our current rate is a near rock bottom 3.25% and who knows what it could be in 12 years when we hit the 15 mark, but in all likelihood it would be higher, considering how low it is now. Because of that, despite the conventional wisdom of dealing with a low interest mortgage, I've been starting to put extra towards principle every month. I doubt it will be possible to have the whole thing paid off before the 15 years, but it will surely lessen the impact should the rate skyrocket (12.25% I believe is the cap) .

That brings me to my question at hand. I am just wondering how I would go about calculating the new payoff date etc. once that 15 year mark hits. I am assuming, but haven't confirmed, that just changing to a new interest rate in the app would apply that interest rate to all its past calculations and throw everything off. My guess is the best way to figure it out is to just get rid of that loan in the app and put in a new one - 15 year mortgage, for whatever the current balance is at that time, at the new rate. This seems like it would make sense since, from my understanding, with an ARM, when the rate adjusts, the minimum payment is adjusted in a way that keeps the final payoff date (30 years from start) the same, regardless of whether you were ahead before the adjustment or not. So for these calculations, I am essentially starting over with a 15 year loan on the balance. Am I thinking correctly?

Again, considering we are only 3 years into this loan, it's not much more than a hypothetical question at this point, but it's something I was wondering about.

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback, it is useful, but I really was just looking for clarification on how I would treat the calculations after the 15 years (my last paragraph), assuming that we have not paid off or refinanced the loan yet. Thanks :-)",finance

personalfinance,Auto Refinancing Questions,"Hello everyone!

I have some questions on refinancing my auto loan. I've searched around the sub and found some good info but wanted some opinions on my situation.

About 5 months ago I got into a car accident (it was a hit and run) and the other driver totaled my car. Long story short, my insurance paid off the rest of my loan and I only banked about $800 from the residual. Of course, I wasn't expecting the situation and I didn't have a substantial amount saved up for a good down payment for the new vehicle. 

I commute about 50 miles a day for work, so I did my research and ended up with a 2016 Hyundai Tucson. I paid about $16,900 for the car and it had about 27k miles on it. The Hyundai has been the second car I've financed, first one being the one that was totaled. Like I said, I didn't have any significant money for a down payment on my car, so I received an auto loan with an interest rate of 6.6%. It seemed a little high to me, but I didn't have really too many options at the time. Plus, my credit was a little rough since I bought my first house only 3 months prior to this incident. Also to mention, my previous auto loan wasn't paid off yet when I bought my new car since the insurance company/previous loan company took forever to figure out that whole thing.

Now here I am five months later, trying to find ways to save some money. My car now has about 33k miles on it and KBB has estimated trade in value at about $15k and PP at about 17k. I owe $18.5k on the car, factoring in taxes and stuff like that. My current monthly payment is about $315. My credit has improved and has been sitting around 680 lately (it was around 750 before the house and all the car nonsense &gt;.&lt;)

I received an offer from a local CU to refinance. It seems like a good offer, offering a $250 bonus and rates as low as 4.74% for my loan term length. But I'm not too sure if it would make sense for my situation or honestly how a refinance actually works. The credit union offer says things like, no application fees and no money down options.

almost 11k in credit card debt and we're struggling to pay them down because of such high aprs.

Most of the time we can only afford minimum payments or just a few dollars more than minimum.

I want debt consolidation to pay them off and have a lower interest rate and payment, but I need the payment as low as possible. After they're paid off I will cut them up and trash them.

personalfinance,Engineering student in crisis. What should I do?,"I believe my situation is very uncommon so, for context, I’ll explain. My first two years or so I was completely undecided in terms of my major so I was just taking core classes to try and figure out what I wanted to do. During that time I was able to narrow it down to STEM fields and I liked chemistry and was good at math but I wanted to make more money so I thought Chemical engineering was what I should do. I did well my first year (third year total) and my second year (4yr total) I really only had one bad class but my third year (5th yr total) I bombed process thermo and pchem and had to drop (and  will retake later, this coming fall). So I talked to a counselor, told her I still wanted to be a ChemE, and so she suggested I add a minor (I chose business). I know I needed to keep my number of credit hours in the range of federal aid credit hour requirements. I applied to FAFSA and everything like I always do and got my normal loan estimates. But when I tried to accept, there were no student loans to accept. Apparently I had already reached my loan cap which I didn’t expect to happen until next year which I was planning on filing as an independent so that I could raise that loan cap. Now Im kind of freakin out and I know I can’t pay my own tuition and afford to live and work and go to school all at the same time. My parents are divorced and definitely can’t help pay for all that. Maybe a little, but not much. I desperately dont want to drop out. Literally earlier today I even thought about joining the military?? thought I know nothing about that.

personalfinance,Refinance mortgage? Only been a year...,"So my wife and I did a standard FHA mortgage loan through UWM for 200k.. I only had enough to cover the 3.5% down payment that was required for the loan, which means we closed at 4.75% interest rate... I wasn't very thrilled with that, but our lending agent told us that he would keep an eye on the market and let me know in the future if he could get us a better rate.  He was recommended to us by our real estate agent (who we know personally), so I trust him pretty well. He called me a few days ago and said that because of our payment history, which we haven't missed a payment for a year, we could refinance and lower our monthly payment and overall interest rate.

Okay, so what is the downside to this? I've looked over the paperwork that he sent over, and there literally doesn't seem to be a negative... we would get a 3.75% interest rate on the new loan, and save about $120 a month on our mortgage payment.  It seems that it would just reset our 30 year timeline, and we would have to pay for the appraisal up front, and maybe a few hundred dollars for closing costs... am I missing something here? I feel like this is too good to be true, but I pretty much trust this guy...

personalfinance,Student Loans for my final year of Grad School - how much should I take and should invest anything now?,"Alright so as the title states I am entering my final year of grad school (unless something changes I suppose). I'll have a Master's and can really start looking for a career. Here's my finances at the moment:  


* $750 in Savings 
* $2800 in Checking
* My parents offered me $3000 which I can take now or later

&amp;#x200B;

And my expenses 

* Living with my parents for the summer, so other than maybe getting Taco Bell or going to the movies I won't be spending much. I mean I already spent $20 on New Coke because I like *Stranger Things*, but the point is I don't have ongoing expenses, yet.
* I go back to campus at the end of August, but I do have to pay for August. Luckily, my rent is just $430/mo. No utilities, unless I go over a certain amount that most tenants don't surpas. I'll have to be more careful with the AC, but that's about it. 
* I have $39,675 in loans already (5.1%).
* For this semester I owe $5,959.46.

&amp;#x200B;

I live close enough to walk to class, but I will still have a car if I get a job I need to drive to. Unfortunately a $47,000/yr position didn't go through, despite me feeling the phone interview went well, but that's getting off topic. I'm not in the city where my campus is located so job searches can be a bit hard, but I know even a minimum wage job is $11/hr. Although I have three classes I have pretty good time management, so while I probably won't be able to get a 40/hr a week job (at least not without tweaking my schedule) I plan on working a fair amount (I need to work it's just about the finding the where).  

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that is enough detail. The question I'm asking is essentially how big of a loan should I take out? Last year I decided to pay most of tuition with a loan and use the money I had saved to pay for rent and whatnot, which worked out and I was even able to pay for a summer class with no loan. Now, and please correct me if I'm wrong, I believe with student loans you take out an amount for the academic year. This is frustrating because I don't know what my finances will be like next semester and I want to minimize the amount of loans I take out. Also I've only ever used Federal loans, they always seemed like the smarter choice, but let me know more about private loans if they might help me more. As far as I know they generally have lower fixed rates and you can do income repayment plans, plus student loan forgiveness (if I were to a year in the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps for example), but let me know if they might be better. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the second question I had was what should I do with the remainder? I've been told it is best to pay off what you can when you can, so I'm prioritizing taking out the smallest loan I can and using what I have to pay tuition. Again, let me know if this is a sound decision.  I put the $750 in savings with the idea I wouldn't touch it. I would let grow ever so slightly over the years and only put money in, unless there's some emergency. So should I put any in a mutual fund (and how would I even do that), should I invest in stocks? My family has almost no experience with this, I think someone was ripped off in a penny stock scam and I've often viewed it as a ""rich person thing,"" so that's probably why I've avoided them, but if you can point me towards good resources I would appreciate it. Are there other safe ways to let improve my future finances?

Last year I received a large federal tax refund and would like to reduce it in exchange for a larger paycheck. I've determined that I need to submit a new W-4 to my employer (located in Illinois) that will change my withholding  allowances from 1 to 4. My questions are:

2. If I need to submit the [IL form](https://www2.illinois.gov/rev/forms/withholding/Documents/currentyear/il-w-4.pdf), how should my 4 allowances be entered on lines 2 and 3 of IL-W-4?

investing,[Question] Wall Street has already priced in an interest rate cut. Why is this considered good?,"This will postpone the next recession at the expense of making the next recession worse. With inflation at target zones, this will weaken the dollar by putting even more dollars in circulation. Inflation points to raising interest rates right now. During a trade war with China, the global economy would be dragged by a weaker dollar causing US imports to be more expensive and exports to be cheaper, making less incentive for US businesses to trade internationally. A weaker dollar would hurt the US semiconductor, oil, aircraft, auto parts/industrial machines and food industries the hardest, all staples of the US economy. It might help the US internally for a while, but an interest rate cut would swiftly take down surrounding economies leading to a domino effect hitting the US hard in the end.",finance
worldpolitics,"Believers were arrested and forced to sign repentance. If not, they were tortured till their death. Evil!","The pro-CCP and anti-cult activist organized a sideshow in front of the Blue House, the residence of the Korean President. She was in for a surprise, as refugees fought back with their own, more successful press conference.

## But couldn’t you please stop reporting about Ms. O?

Readers of *Bitter Winter* may start being fed up with Ms. O Myung-ok. The [notorious Korean bigot](https://bitterwinter.org/story-of-o-korea-bigot/), who tries to stir animosity and hate against all minorities, is not an entertaining subject. Yet, she causes real suffering to harmless, vulnerable human beings, and this is the reason we keep denouncing her nefarious activities.

Take June 22. Despite previous fiascos, Ms. O organized what is her tenth false “spontaneous demonstrations” against refugees from [The Church of Almighty God](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/the-church-of-almighty-god/)(CAG) in South Korea, who escaped from China where members of their religion are routinely subject to arrest, detention, and torture. The [CCP](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/ccp/) has issued [multiple secret documents](https://bitterwinter.org/campaign-against-cag-extends-to-south-korea/), calling for a clampdown on CAG refugees around the world. Ms. O may be seen as the manager of the Korean branch of this CCP campaign.

Despite consistent lack of success, the CCP and Ms. O always reenact the same script. Relatives of the refugees in China are [manipulated or coerced](https://bitterwinter.org/i-refused-to-go-to-seoul/) to travel abroad and form a “search group” that will demonstrate asking the asylum seekers to “come home.” Of course, should they really go to China, the refugees will find a new home in a “comfortable” Chinese [jail](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/jail/).

The “search group” is demonstrating in Seoul from July 22 to 24, and Ms. O started the three-day false “spontaneous demonstration” with a sideshow intended for the media. She was in for a surprise.

## Refugees Fight Back

Around 10 a.m. on July 22, led by Ms. O, the Chinese party “seeking for relatives” arrived at the Fountain Square in front of the Blue House and started a press conference trying to discredit CAG refugees and calling for their deportation back to China.

It seems that, in typical Ms. O’ style, there were professional demonstrators among some 25 people who demonstrated. They are hired guns who would shout hate slogans wherever this is required. This time, it was about the “false refugees.”

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/v4r7hovn95c31.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

Unlike other groups, the CAG had so far reacted with Christian patience and forgiveness, and did not fight back. Not this time. Enough being enough, more than 30 real CAG refugees showed up in front of the Blue House and staged a counter-protest and an alternative press conference, which was more successful than Ms. O’s usual vituperations. Unlike Ms. O’s hired thugs, these were real victims of the CCP persecution seeking asylum in Korea. Some were left homeless after being hunted for years by the CCP, some had been tortured. “Can O Myung-ok really mask the truth of the CCP’s religious persecution by viciously labeling Chinese Christians as fake refugees?” CAG members asked.

Xiao Rui, one of the protesters, fled to South Korea three years ago. Prior to this, she had been arrested, brutally tortured and sentenced to three years and six months in jail in China merely for her belief in Almighty God.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/63iqvsoq95c31.jpg

She said, “I was born in China and grew up there, never knowing what [human rights](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/human-rights/)are, or what freedom of belief is. I’ve seen Christians all living under the fear and the stress of potential arrest.”

Facing the CCP’s false accusation and slander, Xiao Rui said, “I’ve always looked forward to the day when I can reunite with my elderly parents and fulfill my obligation of filial piety, but I don’t dare to go home. This is because some CAG brothers and sisters who went back to China to see their parents were arrested and imprisoned, and their whereabouts remain unknown to this day.”

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vi5m7yqt95c31.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

## Manipulating Families

Perhaps, the most disgusting part of Ms. O’s and the CCP’s sideshow is preying on the family feelings, terrorizing or manipulating parents and other relatives who already suffer for the persecution inflicted to their loved ones to participate in plans to bring their back to China and to jail. There was an eye-catching signboard on the scene, which read “Dear Mom and Dad, do you know you’re used by CCP? I’m heart-broken. You join the CCP for false demonstrations, knowing I’m in danger due to its persecution.”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/1u5gfvsz95c31.jpg

[Mr. Jia Zhigang](https://almightygod-isthetruth.blogspot.com/2019/07/How-was-a-mainland-actor-smuggled-by-the-CCP.html), a CAG member, told *Bitter Winter* that the group of false demonstrators included his father-in-law and his wife’s younger brother. Mr. Jia reported that prior to July 21, he had already learned that his relatives were coming to South Korea. On the 21st, he and his wife went to Incheon International Airport to pick up their relatives, hoping for a quiet family reunion. However, much to their shock and sadness, their family members who came to South Korea to “search for relatives” refused to reunite with them. On the contrary, they followed Ms. O’s itinerary and took part in the false demonstration, pretending to “search for relatives” they had in fact already found. Jia said he had no idea what exactly his family had experienced.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/4tl6ego3a5c31.jpg

## Dangerous Liaisons: Ms. O and the CCP

The CAG refugees reminded the media that, “the CCP’s wicked deeds of religious persecution pile up. as it dismantles crosses, demolishes churches and detains millions of Muslims in the [transformation through education camps](https://bitterwinter.org/Vocabulary/transformation-through-education-camps/) in China, which has been disclosed and denounced by the international community. Why is this evident fact ignored by Ms. O? As a Korean citizen, why does she have to devote herself to the CCP’s propaganda and work for the CCP so diligently?”

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/nir41j19a5c31.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

The CAG members raised signboards to express their doubt during the protest: “O Myung-ok is hell-bent on howling for extradition of Chinese Christians, how much has the CCP slipped into her pocket?” “See O Myung-ok’s true face as the CCP’s lapdog! Is she a secret Party member?”

The appearance of the CAG members took Ms. O by surprise. She became irritated in front of the truth. During the protest, she pointed her smartphone to the CAG members who raised signboards to protest in silence, and tried twice to rush towards them. Despite the intervention of the security guard present, she kept filming these protesting Christians, accusing them to be fake refugees. She even tried to disrupt the CAG press conference and offended some reporters, accusing them not to be on her side.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zpd71uqca5c31.jpg

The false demonstration led by Ms. O, which was scheduled to proceed from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m., in the end lasted less than an hour, ending in disgrace as usual. If it would not be out of proportion to disturb William Shakespeare (1564-1616) for Ms. O’s sordid activities, we would borrow a quote from *Hamlet* and conclude that she has been “hoisted with her own petard.”

personalfinance,Mortgage lender suggesting jumbo loan at a lower rate then conforming - good deal or not?,"Over the past year we’ve been building a new house and are now about 45-60 days out, so I’m starting to lock down loan options. 

When we went under contract we pre-approved with one of the builder’s recommended lenders at (big bank) due to ease and the relationship, with every intention of shopping around later. 

Right now (big bank) is suggesting that we consider putting less down upfront and to take a jumbo loan through them at a lower interest rate. Since we started the loan application last year we are grandfathered into 2018 conforming limits. The loan comes with the ability to recast for free whenever we want. So the idea is that we’d close at a lower interest rate and put less cash down, and recast after closing to where we want to be. 

Our purchase price is around 650k and originally planned on putting down 250k. 

The jumbo loan rate they’re offering (as of last week) is 3.75% with about $3k in lender credits towards closing. I’m able to get about the same rate (maybe slightly lower) with a different lender as a conforming loan, but I also miss out on the lender credits. For reference, (big bank)’s conforming rate on the same day was 3.875%.

Calculating the cash we’d spend up front, the extra interest we’d be paying monthly, and the recast payment, it appears to be pretty much a wash versus the most competitive conforming offer I’ve received from different lenders, with the added benefits of:

-	ability to recast for free in the future
-	being able to sit on the extra cash during the move and a baby born at end of year
-	we can still afford the increased monthly payment (under 20% DTI)
-	lender has a relationship with builder
-	(big bank) would service the loan for the lifetime of the loan, not have to worry about it being resold

So...is this a good deal? Could there be gotchas I’m not seeing? Should I just keep it simple and stick with a conforming through another lender? Are there questions I should ask?

personalfinance,"Realistically, will I be able to purchase a home by age 30?","Hello everyone and thank you for taking a moment to read this. 

I am turning 28 in just a few days. I've just begun my career as an airline pilot only a few months ago. First year pay isn't great, but it isn't terrible either. Anyway, I'll get right into it:

**My Debt:**

Currently I have a **total of $68,300 in student loan debt**. This consists of a **private student loan of $31,000 @ 4.25%**  and the remainder is in **federal loans varying from 3.5-4.5%**. I have been paying these down aggressively; I started with $96,000 total in student loan debt around the beginning of 2018 (I only started keeping track of my payments in Sept. 2018). Personally, I want this debt gone, asap.

**My Income**:

Currently, being so new to the company and just finishing training, having such low seniority, my pay isn't as much as it will be in the months to come. After taxes, health insurance payments, and 401k contribution (4%), **I make roughly $2,800 + per diem which varies from $300-600, per month.** As my seniority climbs and I earn more flying (work), I estimate this **will increase to roughly $3,500 - $4,000 per month**, before an hourly increase after my year anniversary in April. I also make \~$100-300/month from picking up random stuff on my days off and doing freelance transcription.

* **Potential Income:** I feel obligated to note that the potential earnings for an airline pilot are very nice. Of course, things can happen and I could fail to move up into a major airline, cargo, etc, such as another recession, my company experiencing a fatal accident, etc. The industry is very sensitive to these types of things and I feel it's worth noting. That being said, an upgrade to Captain at my current employer and/or a move to a major airline, cargo outfitter, etc. could put me well into the six figure range. Please, if you know someone who's had a bed experience with airline industry, I ask you to stay objective, because it can vary so much from person to person.

**My Living Situation:**

I am fortunate enough to have awesome parents that allow me to stay **rent-free at their homes** (they're divorced). In addition to that, we've made agreements that my car insurance and phone bill will be supported by them, as long as I'm willing to do all the yard work and maintenance, etc. that comes with a home and the four seasons of the Midwest. In addition to that, given that I'm on the road for a decent amount of the month, I barely pay for much groceries. **The downside to this: the drive to work is over an hour one way**. I don't enjoy this for many reasons that I'm sure most of you can sympathize with, so I won't get into the many reasons why.

**A Home???:**

So, finally, I ask, how in the world could I possibly afford to purchase a home and get out of my parent's homes around the age of 30? **I have almost no savings** besides a $1,100 ""emergency fund"". **75-90% of my take-home pay goes toward my student loans**. I have considered decreasing that and starting a fund for a down payment on a home, but only feel that will make things harder for me in the long run, as I will hold the student loan debt longer. I want to move closer to work, get out of my parents homes (because what 30 year old lives at their parents!?!), and truthfully because I want to be a home owner. **I have thought this: pay the student loan debt off in full as quickly as possibly and then immediately save everything I can for a down payment, and hope to be out of here before 31 (30, if I'm lucky).**

Side note: I have no interest in moving out just to move into an apartment because it's closer to work. I don't enjoy living in an apartment and the things I am able to do here at my parents consist of many outdoor activities that cannot be had while living in an apartment.

I am curious what current home owners and/or student-loan-debt holders think of my situation and the ultimate question, Will I be able to purchase a home by 30?",finance
personalfinance,I am getting absolutely murdered by credit card interest. Do I have any options besides a balance transfer?,"Hey all. I have a Chase credit card with a 6580 dollar balance.

I'm not in a good spot to pound this debt yet, i'm picking up overtime but theres just other life things right now that are taking me away from being able to pay extra.

personalfinance,Using Federal Student Loan to Pay Off Car,"I have a fair idea that I'm doing the right thing, but I really wanna make sure. 

I'm in college, and I've received a Pell Grant that covers nearly all my tuition (I'd need to foot 400 bucks, which is chump change in the higher ed world anyway). 

BUT, I've also been offered a completely extraneous $6,250 unsubsidized Federal loan. 

After comparing the interest rates, the loan interest is about half my car interest (4.53% compared to 8.5%).

Now, I'm thinking of taking out the loan and dropping it all on my car. This would save me a lot of money in interest. Should I? Or is there something I'm missing? 

Note that the loan isn't enough to actually pay off my car, but would cover half of it. I owe about $12,800 on it. 

Thanks, folks.

EDIT: Once I graduate, I'll be able to make both payments. I live in a low low COL area and have a job that literally lets me work as much as I want.

personalfinance,Strategies to Refi+Cash Out my mortgages with multiple 60-day late payments last year?,"I've owned my house 15 years now, so I'd like to take advantage of current low interest rates to do a 15-year fixed refinance of my two 30-year fixed mortgages and take some cash out for renovations and other home improvement needs.

Thing is, I'm in this weird situation:

I'm a well-paid programmer who works as a contractor for a single company. I'm basically an employee, but get paid with a 1099. My ""employer"" had some cash flow issues so I got slowed paid on my ""paychecks"" (invoices) for nine months last year, and as a result I had multiple 30- and 60-day late payments on my primary and secondary mortgages. I had four 30-day lates and three 60-day lates across both mortgages between May and August last year. Other than that, I've never missed a payment ever.

My gross ""salary"" is close to $200K, but with expenses and deductions my taxes show I make around $75K. CreditKarma says my FICO is 729. Zillow says my house is worth $1.3M and I owe $543K so my current LTV is around 42%. I'd like to take out up to $100K which would push my new LTV to around 49.5%. I live in Orange County, CA so my understanding is that FHA limits in my area are $726K; however, I think my late payments disqualify me from FHA altogether?

I tried calling a couple lenders and they said they couldn't service me with any lates within the last 12 months or with more than one 60-day lates on my credit report. So while my 12 month window on any lates closes at the end of August, I won't be able to do anything about those 60-day lates for another six years. A friend of mine said he knows of a private investor who'd take my refi, but would want close to 10% interest.

Am I screwed? Any ideas how to get a refinance in the short term? Does anyone know of any lenders who would service someone like me at somewhere close rate to market (or at least less than 5% APR)? I'm trying to figure it all out, but it's hard to navigate.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation Loan,"I'm looking into getting a debt consolidation loan to wipe out my credit card debt and the remaining student loan debt I have.

personalfinance,What is the best plan for my student loans as a medical student?,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am about to start medical school this fall 2019. I have significant student loans from undergraduate/graduate school (\~$85k, 5.9% interest average, please see table below), anticipate that I will be in medical school 4-5 years (my school offers a fully-funded research year), and if everything works out I will not accrue more student loans from my medical school program. 

For my undergrad, I went to an expensive school after my parents told me that they would help with my education and gave me incorrect FAFSA information (so I committed to the school which turned out to be much more expensive). I take full responsibility for my graduate loans because I wanted the Masters of Public health (MPH).

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently trying to figure out what is the best course of action for me, any advice is appreciated and thank you so much!

&amp;#x200B;

**MY SITUATION:**

\-I have a BS in human physiology and a MPH in biostatistics/epidemiology

\-I receive significant financial aid from my medical school. **HOWEVER**, I am required to take out a $15k loan each year, $7.5k in federal unsubsidized student loan (6.6% interest) and $7.5 school loan (0% interest while in school, 7.5% after) 

\-I do not need this $15k because my significant other (MD-PhD candidate) is covering my groceries/living expenses, so if need be I can repay this loan with the money they provide me

\-I may receive an extra $10k in grants/scholarship for living expenses if my math is correct

&amp;#x200B;

**MY PLAN:**

\-Live like the brokest student you can imagine. I don't uber, thrift clothing/cooking tools, don't eat out, make my own coffee, you name it.

\-Get a part-time research biostatistics job in med school to (most importantly) build my resume and generate income to pay living expenses/student loans

\-Make as many/much student loan payments as I can with what excess money I have

\-**IMPORTANT:** Use the yearly $15k loan provided by my school to pay off the high-interest loans I have from my graduate degree

\- I hope to minimize my living expenses so I can use that yearly $10k of grants towards my highest loans

\- I hope to use the majority of my salary during my research year ($25-35k estimated) to pay towards my loans

&amp;#x200B;

**MY CONCERNS:**

\-I am frustrated that my loans generate interest while I am still a full-time student and thus cannot make significant payments

\-I am worried that my interest will snowball into something ridiculous by the time I get out of medical school

\-I am worried that these loans will affect my ability to financially start a family, buy a house, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY QUESTIONS:**

1. What can I do (if anything) to prevent my loans from snowballing? I am not interested in joining the army, I don't think that PSLF would be right for me as it doesn't make sense to stretch $80k over 10 years (but someone feel free to prove me wrong!), and am unfamiliar/unsure about refinancing or consolidating.
2. Is there anything else that I should be thinking about?
3. Would it be financially unreasonable to start a family during the 4th year of medical school?

&amp;#x200B;

**ADDITIONAL INFO:**

\- I plan on setting up a meeting with my school's financial aid office to discuss my current financial state

\- My significant other's salary will not be able to help me much with my student loans as it will barely cover our living and they are hoping to save up for a car/house so we can avoid paying rent for 8+ years

personalfinance,How does auto-refinance work exactly? First time buyer..,"Hi people,

I am about to refinance my vehicle. I purchased it at $22k with interest rate of 5.99%, which made total payment to be $25,513 (including interest). Now it has $21.5k (I am refinancing after first payment).

As far as I understand, if I refinance it through bank, they will pay remaining $21.5k and I need to pay bank with lower monthly payment. But with all the ""total payment"" and other terminology makes it little confusion now. I feel like it is either of two:

1) like mentioned, bank pays off $21.5k and refinance.

2) bank pays ""total amount"" - how much I paid. Basically my total was $25,513 - $500, which is $25,013. Bank pays off this amount and I refinance with them, which increase the payment actually(?).

This idea confuses me a little. It feels like it is different from student loan refinance. Does anyone know how it works? If it does work like 2), why would anyone refinance?",finance
personalfinance,"Hi all. I am hoping for a bit of advice re student loans, real estate investment, and financial independence","I have been doing light research whenever I can find the time in-between work and study, but would much rather hear from people directly. Thank you in advance for tips and advice!

Background:
I am 30 years old. I just graduated law school with $130k in debt and I think the interest rates between 5.3-7.6%. Only 1/3 of these loans are for actual tuition, so Im 99% sure the loan forgiveness program wouldn't do much for me. I am looking into it now. I have $0 savings. I have a very meager financial support system that could only come into play for dire emergencies. The area of law, real estate (anything that offers me a position really) I intend on pursuing pays roughly $65k/yr starting. If I work like a horse, I can double that, which I intend on doing as soon as I pass the bar. My fiancé earns roughly $90k/yr and supports her parents. We do not have children yet. Neither of us own any substantial assets. She has $50k in savings. I live with my family. She rents. We intend on marrying in a couple years when we buy a house. We live in So Cal and because we will be supporting her parents, we expect to find a fixer-upper duplex in the $700-800k range.

I have, within the past year, started lightly reading finance and investment books and blogs, and have been playing with $1k in robinhood. In the near future, I would like to make investing a regular hobby and supplementary source of income to be spent on small/insignificant luxuries for my family. Once I have paid off a significant amount of student debt, I would like to start thinking of real estate investments. We have multiple close family members and friends involved in real estate in some capacity, so it would not be too substantial of a leap to go from this community's support and my exposure in real estate law, to real estate investing.

So I'm just wondering what similar experiences everyone here has had and what did/did not work for you. Should we put off buying a home until my loans are paid off? Should I accept that I will be paying off loans for the next 20 years and be willing to pay that interest rate so that I can do other things in life like buy a house, invest in real estate, and start a family?

I'm looking at a 2019 Tesla Model 3 AWD which will cost about $56,000. I will be purchasing this car. I have $60,000 saved (don't worry, this figure doesn't include my emergency fund). I'm leaning towards financing this car as I have a credit score of 810 and am able to secure a rate at least as low as 3%. If I do nothing else with the money saved other than tucking it away in a HYSA or a CD, my effective rate will be 0.5% though I'll probably find a better use for the money if I don't just buy the car outright. I'm looking at around $850 / month for 72 months to finance this vehicle though with the federal and state tax incentives it will come out to around $800. The specific build on this vehicle will be increasing by $1000 in August.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, if I buy the Telsa now, I will have 2 car payments for a couple months but will end up saving about $2000 in the long run. I know I'm screwed because of my lease situation and needing a new car at the end of the lease anyways. Thoughts?",finance

However I still want to keep my savings account at Fairwinds since I have my checking account with them, and transfers are instant with the app if need be. I'm thinking it would be good to keep a month or two of cushion in the Fairwinds savings for the better liquidy, and the rest in Ally to take advantage of the interest rate.

personalfinance,Grad school loan vs cash,"Hi- my wife is a teacher and was recently accepted into a graduate program for educational administration. 2 year online program (6 semesters) with a total program cost of ~$21,000.  Completion of the program gets her a $6000 raise and opens her up to the possibility of higher paying administrative or school district positions down the road. 

My dilemma is- do we pay upfront for the program each semester or take out federal loans and pay back as we go? We have about $40k in savings (outside of retirement) with the majority in mutual funds and 40k kept 100% liquid for major emergency. In theory, the investment account isn’t supposed to be touched and will keep growing until retirement. 

My idea is that we take out a $3500 federal loan at 6% each semester and pay it off over the course of the semester. We currently save $1000-$1500 per month and would likely end up paying $50 in interest to pay the loan over 3 months. This way the money we currently have continues to grow while we halt our traditional saving to pay the loan.  All of our family thinks the idea of a loan is crazy and that my wife shouldn’t pursue grad school if we don’t pay it upfront. 

For my own peace of mind, it’s much easier to visualize a bill needing to be paid down vs proactively saving. Also, the idea 40k compounding over 40 years seems much more lucrative in the long run than cutting it in half and hoping we save it all back. Am I crazy to want to take out a loan?


Edit: After further research I’ve found I could front load semester 1 into a 529 plan for tax advantages and save up to pay every semester upfront with 529 savings without touching my larger investment principal. It will require more discipline on my end...",finance

personalfinance,Should my mother pay off debt with life insurance money or her 401k?,"My mother has debt we need to pay down as most of it is high interest rate credit cards. Shes 70, and she still works as a nurse, however very little more than the minimums are being paid. She overextended bad when she bought her condo.

I dont know if theres much room for a HELOC, and besides she probably wont get approved as her balances are maxed and her FICO is in low 600s. 

I found out she has a small life insurance policy that shes had for 10+ years. I decided to get into the terms. She has about 11k in cash. There would be no fee to take it out as shes over 6 years vested now. The policy lets her take a loan out, or a partial surrender. 

I couldn't find much info regarding details on these two options however. If she takes a loan, is it subject to 2019 taxes as income? Also, when she pays interest on this loan, is it to herself similar to a 401k loan? 

What about just claiming like 10k of the 11k in cash as a partial surrender. I read this wont close the policy like a full surrender would. Is there any downside to doing this? Is it subject to taxes? 

I just ask because between fed and state shes at 30% tax brackets, so trying to avoid as much damage possible. 

The other route is 401k, as she had about 150k in it, market may be facing a recession in a few years, so it may be better to just take money out of that. I know taxes come in though.  I don't think she can get a 401k loan at 70, so it would just be a lump sum.",finance

&gt; Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds tracking bonds posted $12.1 billion of inflows for the week ended July 17, the 28th consecutive week of inflows. That brings the total so far this year to $254 billion, on pace for a record $455 billion on an annualized basis in 2019, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysis of EPFR Global data. That compares with $1.7 trillion in bond inflows over the past 10 years, the bank said.

...

&gt; Investors are parsing mixed signals on where the economy is headed. Dimmer expectations for global growth have pushed S&amp;P 500 companies to cut their forecasts, pushing the estimated earnings-growth rate for the year to 1.7%, down from expectations of 3% in late March, according to FactSet.

...

&gt; The move into bonds has come even as U.S. stocks have marched to all-time highs. One reason: Corporations have helped support the stock market over the past decade via buybacks, which have contributed in part to a rise in asset prices, Mr. Woodard said.

...

&gt; The potential for lower borrowing costs in the near term could prove to be advantageous for stocks. The last five times the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates outside of recessions—including 1984, 1987, 1989, 1995 and 1998—the S&amp;P 500 rose an average of 11% over the subsequent six months and 16% over the next year, according to LPL Financial.",finance

It's a system with spray nozzles (15 min on / 45 min off). 400W HPS light on for 18 hours and 6 hours off at night. 30 plants with a 50 liters reservoir.

* Distorted / curled downward
* Curled toward the center of the plant
* Plants produce some runners
* Some algae on rockwool cubes exposed to the light
* pH often keeps rising fast from 5.8 to 6.5-6.8 in 24 hours after flush (for 2-3 days). It still increases after, but slower.

So the first time we contacted the lender they estimated our new note to be ~$1,492, with cash to close at $4,400 (covers closing and upfront PMI).

We’re supposed to be closing tomorrow, but Wednesday evening the lender sends us the closing disclosure and it shows a new note of ~$1,531 and $5k cash to close. So I called and complained because this seemed like drastic increases. The lender agreed to look into it yesterday. 

After a while, he told me that they were able to keep our close date on Friday, and got the new note lowered all the way to ~$1,460, and back down to $4,400 cash to close. This seemed suspiciously low to me, since our monthly escrow was at $289/mo. Our homeowners insurance is $1,570, and our flood is $570.

Apparently our property taxes did not get reassessed yet, and we are paying what the previous owner paid for property taxes. We filed a homestead exemption, and were assessed $27.4k, with a savings of about $870 in property taxes. Please note I’m not entirely sure what those numbers mean, nor do, on our homestead exemption.

I called the title company to confirm with them that we won’t run into an escrow shortage at the end of the year and have to cough up money to cover it or have our note increase. They confirmed that the current amount in the escrow on the CD is correct, but if the property taxes do get reassessed, which they will, we will have a shortage.

Basically, I’m not sure how to proceed from here. Should I tell our lender that we want the property taxes estimated to what they believe it will be after a reassessment? If that’s the case, I believe we will get a check back with the overage amount at the end of the year since we were overpaying for taxes that haven’t gone up yet.

My plan was to finance about $10k of this through a pre-approved loan, but after talking to Bank of America because the dealership I'm buying from isn't just a FORD dealer, I can't get the regular auto-loan rate of like 3.5% and would have to get a private party rate of more like 6%. (I'd also get a 0.5% reduction for platinum preferred status).

I have great credit of 800, no other debt, so I was assuming that financing for a rate of 3-4% wouldn't be a bad call and I could keep my cash reserves while keeping a pretty low car payment. Now that I'm looking at closer to 6% though I'm debating on if I should just take the leap and pay all cash? Also, are there other banks or credit unions that would offer me more of a traditional loan rate for this type of dealer, or is that pretty typical for a place that specializes in just a wide range of used cars? The salesmen said they don't offer in-house financing but he could put me in touch with a state farm agent that they work with.

My current car is a financed 2010 G37. NADA values it at around ~$10,700, and I owe about $8,500. Monthly car expenses (this can vary depending on the mileage driven) are as follows:  

* $250 monthly loan

I like cars. It's the main reason I bought it, but at this point, I am absolutely fed up with the terrible efficiency (15 miles/gallon).

personalfinance,Should I make extra payments on my 30 year mortgage or refinance to a 15 year mortgage for a similar size payment?,"Here’s the gist: 

Our monthly payment on a 30 year mortgage is just under $1500, but we’ve been paying $2000, putting the extra $500 directly to the principal loan. My husband and I are debating refinancing our mortgage to a lower interest rate (roughly .75% -1.0% lower) If we refinance to a 15 year mortgage, our required payment is roughly what we’re already paying, $2000 ( according to online calculators, not a loan officer). Does it make sense to overpay on a 30 year or refinance to a 15 year? We’re planning on staying in this house 7-8 years but not the full 15.

personalfinance,Working for 2 years before law school; should I even try to save for law school?,"I just graduated from college with around $50,000 in private student loans. I was accepted to Harvard Law School via their Junior Deferral Program, which means I'll be working for 2 years (starting now) before heading to law school in 2021. In those two years I'll be working a non-law job, making around $115,000 a year, along with some equity, in a up and coming tech company.

In the 2 years, I'm planning on paying my bills, maxing out my 401k contributions (employer doesn't match but yeah), and paying off my private undergrad student loans before starting law school (9% interest rate, 50k, if I put in 2500 a month I can pay it off in the 2 years). I'll be getting a $10,000 signing bonus which I plan on pocketing as an emergency fund.

After all that, I'll have around $1000 left a month. My question is whether it makes sense to even try and save for law school at this point? Law school will cost me around $200,000 over the 3 years, so should I even bother with putting the monthly $1000 towards that, or should I use that money elsewhere? Maybe invest??

Either way I know I'll be taking out student loans for law school, it's a matter of whether I take out a shitton of loans, or a shitton of loans - 20k lol. If the $1000 doesn't make a difference to the loans, then maybe I should just use it now? With HLS I feel decently confident about being able to pay off my loans following graduation, but am just not sure about this.

Would appreciate any advice!

gaming,"""Don't Even Think"", a new free Battle Royale copied the design of the indie game(Beware of the Weredude) I've been developing more or less by myself. :/","""Twas was the night before Halloween, and four gnarly friends are spending the night together. The power goes out and the full moon shines brightly. Jock Bro stands by the window, illuminated by the light of the full moon. He begins to sparkle... sprouts hair... gets down on all fours... and lets out a blood-curdling howl! It’s the attack of the Weredude! Hyped up on sugars, the remaining hipsters spread out, attempting to build fires to burn the monster, before the Weredude gets them."" - Higoten, someone who supported the development of my game: [Beware of the Weredude.](https://secure.byond.com/games/FlameGuardian/BewareoftheWEREDUDE) (Information at this link is of the original Game in a Day listing and doesn't reflect a more current state of the project, feel free to review my twitter page which has more up to date footage of the game).

&amp;#x200B;

I put my heart into developing something. Something I felt like would appeal to us people that miss the days of retro gaming but love to play multiplayer games. An online horror multiplayer game, that's a platformer with a cool 8 or 16 bit style beefed up with modern technology like cool lighting effects. I originally made this game for a contest, it's called ""Game in a day"" and is hosted by different developers in a small indie game making program community (BYOND). I used this program since I was 5 and I'm now 25 and I still use it and love when I hear about what's happening next. This project began as a game in a day project but continued years after as I continued to work on it.

&amp;#x200B;

So for this game I wanted every map to feel very unique. All very careful designed with many ways to get around, explore and collect gear to fight off some spooky ass Werewolves. Some things are procedural generated, sometimes a bear or some fox might spawn on the map which can very easily end your round if you don't fight them properly. Other times that berry patch that kept you alive through the night might actually be poison berries this time, etc. Maps are also filled with easter eggs, for instance if you find a pool cue and use it on a pool table, there's a fun little animation and a rare item will appear. Or you can try and solve the mystery of the lightening tower in the forest stage, have fun trying to find out how to get the rare silver items left inside that place in one round!

&amp;#x200B;

Assets ideally wouldn't be re-used between maps although characters, npc's and many items are map exclusive. To better explain this I guess, there are 3 maps currently, all act like different game modes. Some involve the Survivors saving hostages or lighting(capturing) campfires in order to win the round. Others are more complex and involve little round-based mysteries/missions for individual survivors in order to escape the map and win the round. Some items do cross over between stages but I'd like to phase that out, right now things like fishing rods and bear traps are unique to the forest, more tech related items like the flash light or taser are unique to the Suburbs and the Motel has many many room keys. Each map as mentioned has a set of unique characters as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Characters are as in depth as what you'd expect in a game like Overwatch, all loaded with cosmetics you can unlock, unique kits/stats and will play very differently not only because of the way they're built but with how they interact in the world. The dog character has a unique set of items he can use, he cannot climb ladders and he can't open most things a human can, but he can drink from toilets and scavenge through trash cans. The professor is slow, but can make portals to jump around the map. The detective has no offensive abilities whatsoever, he can't defend himself but is a great asset for any team trying to track down or hide from a Werewolf.

&amp;#x200B;

A big thing for me to was that this game, like Overwatch would also be very inclusive. I'd love for anybody to be able to jump into my game and be like, yeah this character plays well for me or be like, I relate to or feel in someway represented by that character or this other character too. I was touched when I saw that a post someone playing Overwatch really enjoyed it over other FPS games because there were characters like Winston made it possible for this player to play even though he had shaky hands.  After reading that I wanted to add as many options and features to support color blind, hearing impaired and physically impaired players. Indicators for shots fired, color changing options for outlines and less key press intensive characters as well as custom controls. Did I mention that whatever controller you're sporting will work on the game? =)

&amp;#x200B;

Umm. A lot of what I speak about is already done. The game has 3 functional maps, one being completely done and playable, another being very near completion and the third has a lot of work into it but needs to have it's characters/mode programmed. Like I said, characters are map exclusive, but maps are also like game modes. So as of now, there will be a 3 player, 4 player and 12 player map all like I said with a unique cast, so the 3 characters from the Suburbs are exclusively played there. I have plans on making maps with even bigger casts and somehow making a 2 player mode that could be played locally eventually, these maps will play especially more differently then the current three.

&amp;#x200B;

Now... ..How did ""Don't Even Think"" copy my game? Well, I'll be honest, for a bit I thought maybe they just had the same idea. But then I found out that, and I quote ""Dark Horse Studio started in 2016. This is its first major game. "" See my links in the bottom to find this actual quote if you care to. If you also look at my game in a day contest listing, you'll see that I also released my first version of my game in October of 2016, the same year they began development.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the games differ but the major similarity is that each round begin in day time, and then eventually some players turn into Werewolves once night time hits. I liked this idea as it added to the randomness to the game, you don't know who's going to turn, it might be you! And seeing how unique each character is, it forces random team compositions and I like that! Will we have the Barrista to give everyone caffeine and speed around the map? Or the dog to help control the Werewolf and heal the Survivors.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I'm reaching out and talking about this so much. I honestly would not have minded this so much if the developers at least messaged me to let me know they're making a similar game. They took my idea in 2016, ran with it and now they have released their game. In a way, I'm happy people can somewhat experience what I wanted to make. In other ways, I'm feeling really lousy and am being hard on myself for losing motivation and am thinking of all the times I have been playing games when I could've been completing my own project.

&amp;#x200B;

My friends told me that I should keep my chin up and let this motivate me to work on my game. And I think or at least hope this gives me the kick I need to get back into gear, start working and especially start running test games again soon. If anyone would like to join and play, please feel free to message me, comment below or join our discord.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I'm still hoping to someday release this game on Steam for you all to play. Thank you for reading. &lt;3

personalfinance,Should I withdraw taxable investments to pay off high interest debt?,"Hello everyone!  I am relatively new to credit, so in order to take out a car loan, I had to get a 10% interest rate.  I have enough in a taxable (not an IRA or 401k, just a Robinhood account) investment account to pay it off.  Obviously, going by the flowchart, I should be paying off this debt first.  But should I withdraw from or limit my investing to do so?  Which of these three options is my best bet?


1. Withdraw money from the taxable account to pay off the debt

2. Pay off the debt with my paycheck income without investing any more until it is paid off.

3. Continue investing some while paying some off the debt.

By simple math, I “gain” the best return on my investment by getting rid of the 10% debt as fast as possible, right? Or will my credit score take a hit if they see I am not paying a lot of interest

personalfinance,"I’ve been paying 14.9 percent interest rate on my car for the past 9 months, how do I put a stop to it.","I’m 21 in two months time (UK), and in October of last year I got my first financed car. (Hire Purchased 2015 Ford Focus) 

Long story short, I used to have an old Renault Clio which I paid for in cash, I bought it from my fathers friend who he convinced me to trust and it turned out to be an import, CAT D, with many issues. It wouldn’t pass an MOT after my first year of driving it, uneconomical to repair so I sold it for £600. 

I needed a car for work, I had no savings so I had to bite the bullet and finance my car I have now. I love the car, and the initial borrowed amount was £9700. 

My total payable will be £14,000, I know, it’s absolutely bizarre - but as I expected for someone my age I had little to no credit history at all, I opened up a Very account in preparation of getting this car because I literally didn’t have a credit report. At the time of the purchase I think it was around 500.

Now, my credit has shot up to 756 just 9 months later,  I switched our household broadband to my name, got a phone contract in my name (previously in parents), and other bits and bobs. I’ve been working full time on a decent salary since I was 17, I just never needed credit. 

I need to know what my options are, it seems extremely stupid of me to continue paying this for many more years. Can I sell the car to a dealership and open up a new finance agreement after the settlement? Can I refinance it completely with my finance provider? Can I sell the car privately? Do you think it will even make much difference applying for credit on 500 compared to 750? What interest rates do you think I could get and would it be worth the hassle?

Additional $200/month is $82.3K in interests reduces 9 years  
Additional $400/month is $61K in interests reduces 14 years

Refinance 3.25% would cost $47.3K in interests for 15 years  
Refinance 3.44% would cost $50.3K in interests for 15 years

He mentioned about $3200 in costs which he can't say as exact.  He wasn't very convincing and hard to hear on the phone, so I was able to get another person from same bank.

Got a call bank from a local credit union and was told that the interest and APR are the same 3.25% No fees, credit check they will pay, etc.  They will just create a new escrow, (and I'll get the built-up one from the old bank).  Obviously this is the better choice, but is it common to have the Interest rate and APR the same?  She did say principal and interest is  $1264.80 , which to my calculation should be $1229.67 which is puzzling.

With that said, after that mess, should we dump $20K more in the house or just put in retirement?  If the one with same APR and interest rate is for real, should we borrow money and invest instead?  I'm 40, wife is 38 and son is 11.  Don't have much retirement fund yet, since we've mostly been saving.

personalfinance,Huge Student Loan Debt; On a fixed income (military),"Hey everyone!

Small rundown of myself:

* **23 years old**
* **Am moving shortly to Texas for Training**
* **Income: $36,417 (This is not counting my Housing Allowance or Sustenance Pay)** 
   * Monthly estimate w Tax: $2678.26
* **TOTAL COLLEGE DEBT: -$123,178**
   * I additionally have a $25,000 loan I have to repay (Career Starter Loan)

I went to college to pursue a nursing degree. My parents make decent money, but have said many times that no matter the school we go to they would only sign the loans but not help to repay them back. Being young and stupid (aka listening to what my parents suggested) I ended up going to a private school, and given my degree was unable to get an ROTC scholarship (they don't give out hardly any nursing scholarships). I do not have any credit card debt (I am in the process of applying for some now so if you have any suggestions lmk \*\*Yes I do know about SCRA\*\*). I have very very minimal savings. 

Fast forward to today I am about to move to Texas for school. While there I will be getting paid, but my pay might not start right away. I have to purchase a car and also save enough up to live (potentially) without getting paid in a hotel for a little over 2 months. (This is what I got the $25,000 loan for which I have yet to budget)

I have searched about ways the military can help repay this, but as an officer I am limited, even working in the healthcare field. I am now reaching out to reddit in search of someone that maybe had the same situation or found a good way to pay these off as soon as possible.

EDIT: To breakdown my financial situation a little more, here is a small monthly breakdown

What I am currently thinking of doing is consolidating all my loans (Federal and Private), Applying SCRA (which then lowers the interest on all of those loans to below 6%), making them PAYE or REPAY (sucks for the long term) and slowly chipping away at them while making the $450/mo loan payment a priority. Again any advice or knowledge is appreciated.

personalfinance,Which student loan makes more sense to make additional payments on?,"I have started paying back my student loans and have a quick question.. Which would be better in the long term to make additional payments on?

Option 1: $8,000 loan with 8.7% interest over 15 years (Private loan).

Option 2: $30,000 loan with 4.5% interest over 10 years (Federal loan).

Just trying to pay it off the right way to save myself the maximum amount I can in interest. Apologies if this is an obvious question, but I am fresh out of school.  If it matters, I can afford to pay (more or less) an additional $1000 per month on top of the monthly payments, which are about 400 a month total.

Any help is greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Parents want to take out another loan (auto) with my name attached. How much will this affect my credit score?,"I'm trying to up my credit score for my future. It's sitting at around 670 right now and I want to make it higher.

I'm 27 and make 125k/year and am not in any financial trouble (I have job security). I tend to help out with the family and help them take out loans as a cosigner. I have 2 private loans for school, sister has 2 private loans for school with me as co-signer, and my dad is using one of my credit cards to pay off his other credit cards. He doesn't expect me to pay anything for his cards but all these loans are currently holding back my credit score from increasing.

Now they want me to get an auto loan for mom's car. They don't expect me to pay anything. They just want me to start the loan since they are immigrants and don't have connections with American banks (they have the best interest rates?).

How much is this going to set me back from getting my credit back to 700+? Any tips other than just saying no to my parents? I'll probably just endure it and keep working at it slow.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Modum is not a fraud, just VERY cunning","&amp;#x200B;

**Consider this a forewarning of how your own altcoin might be f…ed by the team you trusted later.**  

# I always liked the dividend part of Modum. But just a few days ago they publicized a proposal to convert all tokens into shares. Sounds good right? Certainly not! I feel misled and betrayed. How can you be sure your altcoin will not end up the same?

**TLDR**: skip to the second last paragraph

*First some short background to Modum*

The Mod token has, according to their whitepaper, 100% dividend rights. All shareholders forfeited their dividend rights during the token sale. Reaching certain milestones would unlock tokens for shareholders, and would thus help align interests of both tokenholders and shareholders as the latter group would also have tokens. Never mind that many shareholders later dumped their unlocked tokens to further complicate the issue we now are facing. To me it looks like  shareholders in Modum realized their shares were not worth as much as they could be without dividend rights. So they decided they wanted to improve their situation. The public reasoning behind the proposed swap is something else of course, but while that reasoning may have some merit, actions speaks louder than words. Now keep in mind Modum was financed almost exclusively by ICO funds. That means all activity conducted by Modum was made possible due to ICO funds.  Whatever asset gains made thus originate there. Although the fruits are worth more than the seed now, it all nonetheless started with the seed.

Now, here´s where it gets ugly. Although the ICO financed from what I can gather minimum 90% of the company Modum wants to convert those tokens into shares at an incredulous rate. With Modum´s proposal all the Mod tokens which together hold 100% dividend rights will, when converted, only equate to 16.21% of the shares. That means the founders + those who financed less than 10% of the company in sum gets more than 84% of the shares (when you include the unlocked tokens the % will be higher). To justify this, they pretend the current price of the Mod token, which suffered from Binance delisting, hardly any liquidity, a general bear market, etc. is long-term representative of those dividend rights.

How did they calculate this ratio of 16.21%? There was an AMA in their main Telegram channel 6 PM local time 25th. July where they were asked repeated questions about this, but no proper answer was given, only half-answers (the most critical questions were all ignored or not properly addressed – what a surprise! it actually was a bit of surprise for me, I had always held the team in reasonable high regard, of course not anymore!). From the proposed swap faq and those half-answers we know that they took the average market cap of the token from the first half of 2019 in one hand. Then they took the value of Modum´s company assets by the end of 2018 in the other hand (they wont disclose the actual calculations though so we cannot know if that value is inflated or not). The first number is low, the second number is high. And voila, token holders are screwed.

What we do know however is that Binance delisted the Mod token in February this year and that price and liquidity plummeted after that. + it´s been the bear market. + there are P&amp;D groups who manipulate the price and traders who don´t give a rat´s ass about what they are trading as long as they can make money out of it (I have nothing against traders, just trying to make a point). The token ATH was around 12 USD (why not use that price right, since the situation has only improved from there). Everyone in Crypto knows prices are speculative, and when liquidity is low price is even more volatile and unrepresentative. Real price discovery would probably not happen until dividends were actually disclosed. The point being that the price of the Mod token (and tokens in general – my opinion that is) is at a too early stage to be used to accurately asses both current and future potential/utility of said token. Risk is still high, and price reflects this as well. Long term hodlers didnt mind this fact since future dividends is irrespective of token price, but tied exclusively to token performance! Clearly Modum knows this, but they take advantage of the low price to argue tokenholders should go from 100% dividend rights to 16.21% shares. It takes 9 tokens to get 1 share according to their proposal. That means the price of the share has to be 9 times higher than the token price in order to break even. If that´s realistic or not we don´t know, since Modum wont disclose any numbers or estimation of share price. If you want to break even against ICO price the share price would have to be many times higher than that again (at today´s prices). The potential upside of 1 pure dividend token should be much higher than the upside of 1/9th of a share, obviously, so this proposal sucks!

Somehow Modum completely neglects the fact that all their current assets grew out of the ICO funds, so at the very least the dividend rights should be valued at the amount of money the ICO brought in + a risk premium. But Modum instead values dividend rights at a fraction of shares´worth, based on their own subjective calculations. How arrogant and ludicrous is that? Of course, this question, although repeatedly asked during the AMA, has not been answered by Modum. 

Now, I think a conversion from dividend-rights to shares can be a good thing, but I think the conversion rate is too low. If this rate is the only offer, I´d rather keep my dividend rights. But the problem is our vote may not count, unless we can successfully mobilize enough token holders to vote. Which I think will be hard due to holiday season, short time frame, forgotten tokens on Binance (please vote “No” if you can Binance), many small fish who might not care, etc. Another question is the legality of the vote itself, both according to the whitepaper and the apparent conflict of interest since they came up with the proposal, they get to vote, they have incentives to marginalise us, no independent third party has been involved in the process, no calculations have been given to us, etc.

How is this relevant for the wider crypto community? What if the altcoin projects/companies you are invested in suddenly wants to go the STO-way? How will they convert tokens into shares? Are you sure you can trust the integrity of the team, or might they try to f… you over like Modum try to do with us? What if they want to hold a vote? How can you be sure the vote will be fair and not a fox in the hen house situation. Stay proactive and read the terms of your investment carefully and probe for possible STO-conversion of your token, and if so, its terms.

And if anyone knows a good crypto lawyer in Switzerland, please give comment below, as, as you can probably guess, I hodl some of these tokens and will not put up with this arrogance +++",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Currently Unemployed, Seeking Advice on What to do with Current Assets","Hi All, 

Love this forum, it's my first time seeking advice and there are a lot of little details included, so thank you in advance for reading and providing any insight! 

I left my job in the beginning of June after 10 years of working nonstop to take a breather and reassess my goals. Will have some part time work starting up around the end of August and I have a contract for freelance work beginning up in December. Don't know the rate and consistency of either just yet, so I am going to assume that I should still act as though I am freelance. Would like to know if I am making the most of what I have got, no one in my immediate circle to ask. Here's the breakdown:

I am turning 35 this year and aiming to start a family soon. Expenses are currently covered by husband, however it is expected that I will be earning somewhat close to my former income of around $100K/year after our kids are in school (I made $150k in my former position, so I feel comfortable that this is attainable, even after I take a break to have children). Until then I would like to be freelance while I start my family. Also, it is not my goal to work until 65.  If it is possible, I would like to retire at least a decade earlier!

&amp;#x200B;

**Assets**

\-$10k in my own cash savings (soon expecting a performance bonus from my former job to be around $4k), earning around 2% a year

\-$4.5k in stock plans, rate of return is  3.23% / 1 year

\-$123k in 401k with former employer, portfolio mix of 53% aggressive blend, 40% small, intl, and lg company stocks, 8% bonds. Total of rate of return is 5.4% / 1 year 

\*savings shared with husband will not be coming into play here as we already decided it will be our cushion in case anything happens.

\*insurance and health is covered, no known illnesses

\* I don't own any property but would like to some day

&amp;#x200B;

**Debts**

\-$34k in student loan debt w varying interest rates. $7032.8/4.375%, $21785.02/5.5%, 5137.6/6%. I have a credit score of 807, everything is being paid on time. 

\-zero CC debt

\-zero other debt.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

\-If I continue to overpay on my loans by about $500/mo, I will be out of all debt by May of 2022. Is it better to do this while keeping my savings in cash as long as possible in the meantime or is it better to put down a bigger chunk to minimize interest paid over time?

\-It looks like the general advice on 401k is to roll it over from the former employer to an IRA like vanguard etc. Does that apply in my case? 

\-Anything else?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,"New job, tight transition, need advice on budgeting for debt.","Hello Reddit. I am a big fan of /r/personalfinance, and have been avidly keeping up with it, especially at the prospect of having to manage a larger amount of money in the future.  
&amp;nbsp;

Just for reference, after four months of job searching, I’ve managed to land a job with an entertainment firm as a Senior VR Game Engineer. Game development has been my field for a long time, however I have only recently decided to pursue FTE instead of contracting or part-time work.  
&amp;nbsp;

Just a little bit of backstory. I'm 19 years old. I moved to California a year ago to pursue an opportunity here and attend university part-time. During that time (a year), I racked up about $6167 in unsubsidized loans, furthermore I currently owe my university (USC), around $5000, technically due in full, immediately. The interest rate for my unsubsidized loans is 5.05%, and the interest rate for my university balance is an insane 12.0%. This is less of an issue, as I have been able to negotiate with financial aid and can get these charges removed from my due balance; but more so in the fact that it makes it a #1 priority for me.  
&amp;nbsp;

I had to leave university and throw myself into work after being unable to secure any form of loan, due to the fact I was an independent and have little contact and no help from my parents in this regards. I moved out when I was 15 under strained relationships, my mother is in jail and my contact with my father (who was overseas) has been limited. There was nobody to co-sign on any loans.  
&amp;nbsp;

That being said, I was granted a $5000 loan from the non-profit JFLA, and was able to secure housing for myself over the summer, which allowed me to throw myself into the job search process, and eventually secure the job I have now, which I start on the 30th of this month.  
&amp;nbsp;

In total, I owe $9,667 to the federal government, $6167 of which is unsubsidized and thus a priority for me (the rest being interest free until I need to pay in 2023)⁠— there would be no point to putting my money into a high-yield savings account if I have to pay off against a 5.05% APR. I owe $5000 or so to my university for housing costs, which is an absolute priority, as the APR they charge is insane for past-due balances. However there is leeway for me in terms of payment plans, as they are flexible, because I could’ve just let it run to collectors and left (bad for credit score but what can you do), however I am on a leave of absence and want to remain in good graces with USC if I ever want to return.  
&amp;nbsp;


Finally, there is the $5000 that I owe JFLA which is simply setup into monthly payments of $75 a month. This is mostly a non-issue for me, as there is absolutely no interest given it is a nonprofit setup to help people.  &amp;nbsp;

With my current (new) job, I will be bringing in $150,000 a year, or $12,500 a month pre-tax. $8471.75 a month post-tax.   
&amp;nbsp;

Obviously, maxing my 401(k), which my employer does provide, is a priority for me to get the tax breaks, however my debt is also important to me.  
&amp;nbsp;

Currently, I have around $3800 or so in the bank; however, I need around $4000 to be able to pay for both a down deposit and first months rent for a place in the Beverly Hills area (I do not have a car and need to be close to work, unfortunately). I will be paying about $600 or so for the last months rent, and then receiving back my down-deposit of $850 or so after I move out. My fiancé is going to be spotting me a thousand or so to fill in the financial gaps for me, which I will pay back to her first paycheck. Realistically I will only need about half of that.  
&amp;nbsp;

So, needless to say, my first month is going to be rather rough. Along with this, my job REQUIRES a passport, so I will be spending about $200 to get one with an expedited process.  
&amp;nbsp;

$3800 (savings) + $1000 spot - $200 passport - $600 rent - $2000 down deposit - $2000 rent  
&amp;nbsp;

Would leave me with about $0 to live on, if it weren’t for the fact that I’d get my down deposit of $850 as soon as I vacate my old living spaces. The landlord is a personal friend so the likelihood of me not getting this (we spoke) is very low.  
&amp;nbsp;

Next month, I'll be getting a paycheck for $8471.75 dollars, or so.  
&amp;nbsp;

$8471.75 - $1000 (personal borrow) - $2000 (rent) - $75 (JFLA)  
&amp;nbsp;

Leaves me with about $5000 in the bank post paycheck.  
&amp;nbsp;

Do you have any recommendations in terms of how much I should be looking to tackle this debt versus keeping a buffer in my emergency fund (for things such as these)? Technically, my lease does not expire until the 24th of August, but it’s an hour trip to the workplace without me having a car (which I have plans to save up for).  
&amp;nbsp;

Along with this, how do I prevent lifestyle creep? Is there any advice for budgeting? I will be living alone (my fiance is moving out on the 10th to go do her PhD in VA), so I feel like food costs will not be high.

personalfinance,Is paying off debt ASAP always the best option?,"Just a small disclaimer, I'm currently not in any significant or high-interest debt, I was just reading up on finance and found myself confused on how some of the advice works out. Basically, the advice that conflicts with my personal understanding is ""Pay off all debt as soon as possible,"" which I should emphasize ***might not be good advice in the first place,*** that's why I'm asking it here. I'm mostly new to the finance world for the most part when it comes to looking at the numbers and understanding what they mean in the long run.

The reason the advice above doesn't make sense to me is that some debt - specifically low interest debt - doesn't necessarily need to be paid off as quickly as possible because the average annual return in some investments are higher, so consider paying the minimum payment on the debt and investing any extra money you might have considered paying on it into, say, the S&amp;P 500 stock index (which had an average return of a little over 7% over 10 years from 2003-2013). If the interest rate on your debt is, say, less than 5%, and the average return of the S&amp;P 500 remained at 7% over time, wouldn't it make more sense to make the minimum payment on that low-interest debt and put any additional money into something like the S&amp;P 500 that is going to have a higher yield over time? Sure, on paper you're paying more on interest, but you'd be gaining more from that investment than you'd be paying, resulting in a net positive.

On top of all that, if you account for 2% inflation, if the debt we're considering is something like a mortgage or something that will likely take up to 3 decades to fully pay off, the total value on the interest I'm paying will go down, and when all is said and done the value of the money I've saved by paying off the loan faster is much lower than the value of the money I would have made if I had just put the extra money elsewhere.

Again, like I said, I'm new to this stuff so I could be completely overlooking something or just not understand some basic principle that makes this unrealistic, that's why I'm asking this here. I just want to know if this line of thinking is solid, shaky, or just downright wrong. And maybe show me what I'm doing right or wrong in my thought process. I'm trying to make this make sense to me so I'm prepared.

So I am posting to gather any and all information/advice you all may have for myself and others in similar situations. I have a plan that I will outline towards the end of my post, let me know what you guys think! &amp; sorry for any formatting issues, this is my first post ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of today I have $19K in student loans, $17K  in credit card debt, $7.8K in an auto loan, and $3.9K in a personal loan, totaling $47.7K worth of debt. I ended up in this situation due to a combination of things, bad decision making, compulsive spending, access to subsidized loans, increased credit lines, and most importantly a lack of understanding on how dinero works. I was young and stupid at the time (still am), but now that I am looking at  investing in other money-making methods I find myself needing capital or at the very least to have a grip on my financial situation - so here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

My income is as follows: $4,046/mo

Gross Income: $64K

Net Income: $52K

&amp;#x200B;

For my expenses I've included everything except for all the debts that were listed previously.

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Expenses are as follows: $1,185/mo

Rent: $200/mo

Cell-Phone: $85/mo

Truck insurance: $180/mo

Subscriptions: $70/mo

Gas: $350/mo

Food: $300/mo

&amp;#x200B;

My plan of action is:

1. Limit spending/investing and refocus cash flow towards paying off credit cards
2. Pay off all credit cards

Amazon Prime - Chase:

Interest Rate = 21.49% | Balance = $10,017 | Credit Line = $10,900

Discover It:

Interest Rate = 21.99% | Balance = $3,962.26 | Credit Line = $4,200

Bank Americard Platinum Plus:

Interest Rate = 16.24% | Balance $3,002 | Credit Line = $3,700

a) Prioritize based on highest balance

b) Once paid off, close out 1-2 of the 3 credit cards I currently have.

c) Change spending habit from compulsive buying to delayed purchasing and start viewing expenses as assets/liabilities.

d) Hopefully this will drastically increase my credit score from the current mid 600s to upper 600s/lower 700s, making it easier to apply for other loans (mortgage for first rental property/home)

  3) As I continue paying off my remaining debts I would like to attain my first home loan for a 2-4 unit multiplex. It would be my first home/rental property and the extra units would pay for the mortgage/taxes.

\- I'm leaning towards applying for an FHA loan due to the 3.5% down payment. I've heard one downside is the PWI insurance that needs to be paid for the lifetime of the loan. What are the pros and cons of an FHA loan? What are some other good options?

That's my plan /r/personalfinance I'd love to hear some experiences you all have had with getting out of similar situations, as well as any advice, things to keep in mind, things to keep an eye out for, etc.",finance

personalfinance,I have never been promoted. How do I go about it?,"Throwaway so I can be brutally honest. I'm not sure if this is the right sub but you guys give excellent financial advice and it's a financial adjacent question. 

Basically: **how do I go about actually getting a promotion?**

I have never been promoted in my whole career. The realization dawned on me when I woke up in the middle of the night.

My work history:

* Graduated with a BSAE in Dec '06.
* General engineer '06-'09. Got my MSAE through that job. I left because my husband got a job offer out of state. ($50k-$67k/yr)
* Research Engineer '09-'10. I left because the company was going under. ($68k/yr)
* Instructor/Lecturer '10-'16. I got my PhD while I worked; there was no opportunity to advance. The university didn't want to hire me as tenure track faculty so I left. I also have no interest in being a prof. ($52k/yr-$64k/yr)
* Level 3 Engineer '16-Present at a huge Fortune 50 company. I should've asked for level 4 but I honestly didn't know. ($107-$126k/yr)

I have always left my job before a promotion was an option. Or left because I didn't see promotion potential.

I'm capped on salary in my band now, so from now on I can't get a raise of more than 2%. I have tried for a promotion every year since I started but my department has only promoted two people out of 250ish (except for engineers that went into management). The two that got promoted both had competing offers and a condition for staying was to get promoted. **Is that the only way?** 

My boss has no insight into how promotions work. My boss's boss is useless. My director is just... Shifty? He is a company man through and through. He keeps saying ""we're promoting!"" and points to the quarterly promotions list - where literally none of my coworkers are listed.

I have interviewed and gotten offers but they have low balled me on salary (highest they went was $122k/yr - I brought that in and that's how I got to $126k last year). They also have all said they'd hire me as a level 3 and then promote me a year in. It seems that to be hired in as a level 4 - with us or our competitors, there's a lot more paperwork involved with HR. But I've seen how that game plays out so I'm not moving for anything less than a promotion.

Lastly, we've finally decided to have kids - I've been holding off because of education/career - so leaving would mean I'd lose my PTO and FMLA eligibility (plus my company offers six week parental leave). Thus, I want to stay and figure out how to get that dang promotion. 

Sidenote: I can't get pregnant so we're adopting but it could happen soon or it could take a while.

When I went in to my boss's office asking for a promotion, I brought my work accomplishments, accolades, goal list, stretch goals I met, additional tasks I took on. I think he's fully on board but he's been rebuffed by HR. There hasn't been a clear reason given. 

I'd appreciate any advice, especially from fellow Fortune 50 cogs!",finance

personalfinance,New Investor questioning Federal Bonds vs Investment Bonds for portfolio.,"Hope this is the right spot, I'm new to investing but I have some background in economics. I was wondering why so many people emphasize US teasury bonds even with such low returns? Wouldn't it be better to go with an investment grade bond ETF? The diversity would mean low risk vs recession right, but corporate bonds often have higher returns than USTs. Is it mainly for tax purposes? Are there any adequate replacements for USTs?

personalfinance,TSP account contributions advice,"I just started a civilian federal position at $57,000 a year. I am 25, single, no debt, spend 1/4 of my paycheck on rent, and live pretty simply. Currently I'm contributing 10% into my traditional TSP account because it seems better than sticking it into my savings and it doesn't impact my life by not having that money. I'm debating doing 5% into a traditional TSP and 5% into a Roth TSP during my next pay period. After doing calculations this will give me about $1.2mil for retirement. Here are my questions:

1. Most suggest saving for about $800,000 at retirement so I'm wondering if I'm doing too much? 
2. Should I be switching all my funds to a Roth TSP account because I expect to go up the GS scale and be in a higher tax bracket within 5 years? (Then presumably I'll go back to a traditional TSP fund once I reach my full GS potential.) 
3. The stock market is high so is it best to stay mostly in a G fund until it goes down and then invest into another fund? 
4. At some point I probably want to buy a house and I don't know if I should be so aggressive right now contributing to retirement or if I should hold off? 

I have always been good about saving my money but being in the situation of not being able to touch it is something I'm not comfortable or familiar with. Saving for retirement is very strange to think so far ahead and I don't know if my minimalist lifestyle will be something I continue to have or if at some point I'll want a nice house and material assets. Most of my co-workers my age seem to be paying off student debt or only contributing for government matching (5%) and investing conservatively. I know that I can afford to do more and realize that I should do at least some stock investments. Retirement is confusing to plan for when you are just starting a career. 

tl;dr: Trying to not be poor when I retire but also am just starting out and don't know what the future holds. How do I contribute to my TSP account and still plan for the unexpected?",finance
personalfinance,"Feeling overwhelmed by debt and need help deciding on priorities with my finances (CC debt, student loans, investments, etc.)","So I'm 24 and I make around 3700 a month after tax. I've got student loans from a couple places, one is a 10k private loan at 7% interest and the rest is about 20k in federal loans which are around 4.5% I believe. I've also currently got around 4k in credit card debt. Also have a car payment, loan amount is 20k at 5.5%. So I've got a decent amount of debt.

Expenses are around 3100 monthly (that's after making all minimum payments and getting the maximum employer match for my 401(k).

What should my priorities be with my disposable income? I'm trying to stick to my budget and aggressively pay down the credit card debt now but I'm not sure what I should do after that. I have some investment goals (specifically, I want to save up a down payment for a multi-family rental property and live in one of the units while renting the others), but I'm not sure how far back I need to push that. How much of a priority should paying off that 7% student loan be? I have almost nothing in savings right now (aside from my 401k).

personalfinance,Shortening Credit Age by Paying Off Loans,"Hi PF,

I’m a rising college senior (20) and while this won’t be an issue until I graduate, I’m curious about it now. I’ve taken federal student loans out my freshman and sophomore year, and those are my oldest accounts. I did get my first credit card about a year and a half ago, and have since opened up two other lines of credit. My credit score is currently at 750. 

Thanks to an internship and working with the company throughout the school year, I have enough money to pay off those federal loans. I already paid the unsubsidized loans, but figured I’d hold onto the cash for the subsidized loans until I graduate in case of any emergencies and since it isn’t accruing any interest. I do want to pay them off as soon as I graduate though, my concern is that my average age of credit is going to take a big hit and affect my credit score. I plan on getting an apartment and a car after graduation (with the proper steps from PF of course), so would it be smart to pay off all my loans but a couple bucks in each to maintain the accounts? Or would it not make a big difference? I believe I read that the score still takes into consideration closed account ages, but not sure how significant that is. 

Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,"Maxing Allowances, Minimizing Withholding, and Avoiding Underpayment Penalty","Disclaimer: I am not asking whether this is a good idea or not, just whether it is possible.

I was unemployed until about halfway through 2018. I got a well-paying job and have been pretty happy with it ever since. So far in 2019, I have already withheld the same amount that I paid last year in federal taxes. According to the IRS website, they will waive the underpayment penalty for withholding if the amount paid is equivalent to 100% or more of the tax liability from the previous year. 

Could I change my W-4 to decrease my withholding for the rest of the year without getting the penalty? And yes, I know that whatever I don't pay in withholding during the year will be added to my 2019 tax bill.",finance

personalfinance,Work for NPO which merged and went from 50 employees to 350. Want to negotiate a raise/benefits..,"I'll try to keep this brief

I was hired into a NPO 2 years ago as the IT Manager for 50 employees and 2 sites (straight out of college).

Over the summer we merged with another NPO and I was brought into the ""umbrella"" organization as the IT Manager for all the programs, including the one I worked at previously.  Basically I am now the responsible IT person for 350 employees and probably 8 or so sites (though I might have a little more support).

They transitioned me to the new company with out even signing a job acceptance letter.  They told me to continue my current job duties until they are able to create a new job description/summary for me - working at the exact same rate as I was prior.

For now it isn't a big deal because I'm just doing what I was doing before anyway - but eventually I'll be responsible for assisting with issues throughout the organization instead of just this one program.

My thought process has been that when they provide me with a new job description I can then open negotiations for a pay raise - since my workload will presumably be much larger.  However, I also understand that the majority of my pay comes from a federal grant which has to be budgeted for on a yearly basis, and the budget would have just been submitted this month (June).  If they absolutely can't provide a pay raise, I may try to ask for some other benefit - like working from home once a week or additional PTO hours.

The average pay in my state(and city) for an Information Technology manager is over 100k according to salary.com.  I'm not even making half of that, though I wouldn't expect to make 6 figures either working for a non profit.  I feel like a salary in the range of 55-65k isn't unreasonable though.

What do you guys think is the proper path here?",finance
Bitcoin,The Future of Bitcoin in America and America's intentions to the World,"I checked my history of emails. I have sent about six exchanges and the CFTC various questions about exchange regulation for crypto leverage trading in America, I've contacted them on Twitter. Not one has responded in four months. I'm ignored by all of them.

I think it's pretty clear what they have planned. They are turning the whole market over to ICE and fidelity and running it into the ground. I would love to know any news anyone has about exchanges that are anonymous, or any news about regulations.

If I had family in Canada or Europe I could side skirt this stuff with lawyers and do it above board, but unfortunately I don't. I'm going to be pushed into only trading crude oil and being forced to buy and hodl btc.

It may take the US gove to the end of the year to extort Bitmex, but Arthur has no chance. He may even go to prison like Ross Ulbricht if he turns out to be guilty of anything that happened on that exchange. The US doesn't play fair, and it will fabricate precedent and use it to extradite him and charge him for international terrorist financing or something wild and unfounded.

The US isn't the good guy, Mnuchin is corrupt, he's a sad man who will piss on the world and watch it burn, a historically weak figure, this is the banks and big oil and oligarchs abusing the federal legal system to destroy any real threat they can and then backdoor everything sanitize it and sell it back through ICE and fidelity. There certainly is no real freedom or future in Bitmex. But hopefully the KYC derivative exchanges and crypto businesses abroad can still thwart America's corrupt leadership, even if American's can't participate.

&amp;#x200B;

Roubini may care about the disenfrenchised more than America's leadership believe it or not if you listen to his arguments, but he's so out of touch and so oblivious to the real arguments that Andreas antonopolis makes. Either intentionally weak corrupt men in America or oblivious ignorant men like Roubini will burn this entire thing down. You have to ask yourself, why were we relying on someone like Hayes for freedom in the first place? It's no wonder we came to this situation.

personalfinance,Best course of action from small insurance windfall,"I am looking for some advice on how best to attack some student loan and car loan debt after a small windfall.

**Backstory:** My wife and I bought our first house recently, and then it promptly burned down. Bought a new house with the insurance settlement, and sold the burned out lot. We came out of the whole situation with $19.5k in our pocket that we didn't have before. This amount takes into account the income tax we will pay on the proceeds. **EDIT:** we are both in our mid twenties.

**Including that amount, we now have:**

* $33,600 in savings acct
* $2,100 in an E fund
* $3,200 in short term savings for vacation, Christmas, etc.
* **EDIT:** $1,050 in an HSA. (wouldn't touch this)
* **EDIT:** $14k in a 401(k) retirement account

**Debts**

* I have a car note with about $3,700 left on it. **EDIT:** Interest rate is 5.74%. I make $300 payments (I pay roughly double the minimum payment).
* My wife has around $31.5k in student loan debt. We make $200 payments.

Breakdown of her loans:

|Balance|Interest Rate|
|:-|:-|
|$3,437|3.4%|
|$2,615|6.8%|
|$3,456|3.86%|
|$2,278|3.86%|
|$4,384|4.66%|
|$2,273|4.66%|
|$5,345|4.29%|
|$2,156|4.29%|
|$5,325|3.76%|
|$243|4.45%|

Now, at first blush I am tempted to just pay off everything, be done with it, and use the extra money now freed up to quickly replenish all the savings. Trouble is, I feel scared to not leave a couple thousand held back for emergency house repairs, etc. And I hate to use up the money we saved for Christmas/vacations/etc, but I think it would be better served to get out of debt and then quickly replenish all of that.

*But*, my wife's car is on it's last leg. One major repair bill would really not make it worth keeping. So Option Two I think would be to pay off a good chunk of the loans but not all, use the snowball/avalanche method for the rest, and hold some of that savings back for when that time comes. We could still have a good chunk of money freed up to accelerate payments on the remaining debt.

Do either of these sound like the best plan of attack? Anything better I am not thinking of? If I haven't been specific enough on anything I'll gladly fill in the gaps. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,I was the victim of identity theft involving stolen credit card info and FedEx package redirect,"I'm dealing with the same situation described in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/c07aps/credit_card_scam_involving_fedex_and_their_lack/). The way it happened is that the thieves got ahold of my Citi credit card number and address, purchased a bunch of items from PacSun to be shipped to my house via FedEx. Then they signed up for a FedEx Delivery Manager account under my name, which apparently can be done with minimal to no identity verification, and while the package was in transit they re-routed it to an address in a suburb of Miami, FL.

I noticed the fraudulent charges, including one from FedEx, only a few days after the thieves made the purchase. I immediately called both FedEx and Citi, canceled the bogus Delivery Manager account (and signed up for a real one for myself), got the card replaced, and placed a dispute on the charges. This was all back in mid-June, and since then Citi has been processing my dispute.

Now comes the kicker. Citi just got back to me that they are declining the disputed charge and re-instating the PacSun purchase onto my card. Why? In the documents Citi sent there is a note stating that PacSun contacted FedEx, and a FedEx Supervisor told them that *I* was the one who made the request to reroute the package. Remember, I had reported the fraudulent FedEx account the day I submitted the charge dispute, so apparently whoever PacSun contacted had no record of that. I am appealing the dispute with Citi, but it is highly infuriating.

Some other details:

* It is really simple to set up a FedEx account in someone else's name and address without much in the way of verification. I got a card in the mail from FedEx thanking me for setting up the account, but I only got it *after* the thieves had already rerouted the package and took their loot. I now have a real FedEx account in my name and address, but until this happened it never occurred to me to do that.
* Getting someone on the phone at FedEx the day I discovered the fraud took *hours*. No one seemed to know who I should talk to, and I got bounced around to various call centers and put on hold/hung up on several times until finally someone was able to help.
* The thieves used my name, address, and cell phone number, but used a fake gmail account to place the order at PacSun (and presumably FedEx).
* There is some weirdness in the way that they re-routed the package. In the FedEx tracking info, they changed just the street address but not the city name. I live in a small town in the midwest. The tracking info shows the package as ""On a FedEx vehicle for delivery"" in Miami, FL at 8:24am. Then it shows it as ""Delivered"" in my town in the midwest at 9:46am the same day. When I look for the delivery street address in Miami it goes to a shopping center in Doral, FL, a Miami suburb.

I’m under 18 years old and qualify as a dependent (to my dad). 

I had a question about CA State Taxes. I know that for federal taxes, I am exempt (since it’s less than whatever the amount is), but what do I pay for CA State Taxes? My job has been withholding money for the State Tax portion, at what I assume is the tax level for the lowest income bracket.

Am I also exempt from CA state taxes(in which case I can get a refund?) or do I still have to pay it? How do CA states taxes work for kids under 18? I can’t find the information online and my dad doesn’t know either. 

In any case I find it outrageous that my total taxation is around 9 percent when I can’t even vote yet. I make barely any money and this doesn’t even include federal taxes grr.

personalfinance,I've Uffecked Up,"Hello,  


I'd like to start off by saying that I've messed up. I know it, admit it and own it. I've been stupid, foolish and careless with my spending and I know that I know better. But I did it anyways so here we are....at Reddit looking for the wisdom of the world!   


I've been living above my means for about the last 18 months and its led me to become in about \~$52,000 of credit card debt.  


In the last 18 months I've been somewhat depressed and spiraled down trying to fix it by buying happiness (Which of course doesn't work). I knew what I was doing...I know and understand the interest rates and budgeting and blah blah, I just didn't follow any of my own knowledge because I simply did not care and had a...""Meh I'll fix it later"" mentality.  


Over the last 18 months I've managed to completely destroy my credit score sending it from a 765 to a 580-620 purely due to % of usage vs available limit. I've yet to miss a payment, but I'm now at a point where I am basically dollar for dollar barely able to hit my minimum payment and make my monthly bills etc. My question is how should I go about correcting this? Today, I've decided its time to stop ignoring it. I've started by cutting up all my CC's to guarantee that I will not slip up. I've deleted my credit cards off websites, so for all purposes I no  longer have credit cards. (I've kept one, and hid it in my closet in case something terrible happens and its an emergency.)  


My minimum payments right now add up to about \~$1200 a month, and my ""extra"" income is about $1200-1300 a month. Basically I can only meet the minimum payments at this current moment. I know this isn't a way to live or to bring my debt down because minimum payments means maximum interest. 6k is at no interest (for now), the other 46k is at about \~18.5% interest (yes I know that's a crap rate).  


So my concern is...I can meet the monthly payment and slowly pay it down...but that interest is eating me alive. I can't get a loan to consolidate because my credit score is complete dookie, due to the fact that I'm at maximum usage vs available. (I've tried multiple times at multiple places.)  


I'm expecting a promotion in the next 3-5 months, and I'm almost done with a masters degree. So full time employed and full time student.  


**So my real questions are:**  


Should I just hold out and keep paying the minimums and hope that promotion helps get me out of the hole after about 3-6 months? At that point I could then pay more than the minimums and bring it down over time 3-5 years or whatever.  


Should I stop paying CC's and try and settle and let my credit score be even more destroyed? It's already pretty trash, and I don't care for buying a home or anything big in the next 3-5 years anyways.  


Should I get a second job, or look for a new job all together? Already work standard 8-5 M-F, but will soon have class after work 2-4 times a week through December.  


I'm just not sure what to do to correct this as fast as possible. I'm committed to changing the way I spend and my life style immediately, I'm really just looking for the best way to proceed assuming I take the corrective actions on my spending habits.  


  
Any advice is much appreciated :).

However, I have two student loans that have not entered repayment yet but I could get a head start on. Loan B is currently accumulating interest whereas Loan C will not begin to accumulate interest until I enter repayment in November. Loan B will also enter repayment in November.

Given the minimal savings for paying off Loan A, should I instead put that $900 towards Loan B and/or Loan C. It would feel good to have one less liability but it might be smarter to start working down the others for the long term interest savings.

IRAs generally have better fund choices than employer-sponsored plans because you can open one with the provider of your choice. Low cost providers like Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab all offer low expense ratio index funds. However, you may swap step 5 with step 4 if either of the following statements is true:

* Your employer offers an excellent 401(k), 403(b), 457, SEP-IRA, or SIMPLE IRA that has low expense index funds (i.e., a domestic stock index fund under 0.1% expense ratio, an international stock index fund under 0.2% expense ratio, and a bond index fund under 0.1% expense ratio).
* You have access to the U.S. Federal government's Thrift Savings Plan.

personalfinance,Complicated state tax situation for military veteran recently moved abroad,"**The Situation:**

I have recently retired from the military after 20 years effective 1 July.  I was most recently living in Colorado through the end of April, but my state of legal residence has been Florida for the bulk of my military career all the way up until my retirement date.  For those that may be unaware, military members are allowed to retain their legal state of residence despite where the military decides to move them around. This means that I have not paid any state taxes for nearly 20 years despite living in numerous states that do have state income taxes.

From my understanding, if I had chosen to stay in Colorado after my retirement date I would no longer be eligible to claim Florida as my state of residence and would have had to begin paying Colorado state taxes.  That seems simple enough.  However, I did not remain in Colorado or move back to Florida.  Instead, I moved overseas with my wife under her government orders at the end of April.

According to [this document from the Colorado DoR](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/Income6.pdf), I believe that I will be considered a non-resident and still do not have to file Colorado state taxes, ever, because I was still a Florida resident before I retired, and I moved out of the country before I retired (on terminal leave).

&gt;A person is a “statutory” resident of Colorado if the person maintains a permanent place of abode in Colorado and spends, in aggregate, more than six months of the tax year in Colorado.  
&gt;  
&gt;A nonresident is an individual who was not a Colorado resident at any time during the tax year. However, the person may have temporarily lived and/or worked in Colorado. A nonresident is required to file a Colorado income tax return if they:  are required to file a federal income tax return, and  had taxable Colorado-source income.

For my wife, I believe that she will be considered a ""part-year"" resident because she was living there for the first few months this year.

&gt;A part-year resident is an individual who was a Colorado resident for only part of the tax year. This includes a person who moved into Colorado during the tax year with the intention of making it their home and a Colorado resident who moved out of Colorado during the tax year with the intention of making their home elsewhere. A part-year Colorado resident is required to file a Colorado income tax return if they:  are required to file a federal income tax return, and  had taxable income during that part of the year they were a Colorado resident, or had taxable Colorado source income when they were not a Colorado resident.

**My Questions:**

I recently found a government contracting position out here and will be filling out my paperwork soon. So since I no longer believe that I meet the residency requirement of either Colorado or Florida:

1. What do I do about a State w-4, if any? Or am I somehow screwed and have to adopt my wife's current state of residency?
2. What about my wife's residency next year?  We sold our home before we came out here and have no other ties to Colorado currently.  So will she have to file in Colorado after this tax year?

Where it gets really confusing is pretty much everyone at this NP wants me to stay, myself included, but my internship is running out in a couple of weeks and changing the rule would take a couple months to do, from what I’m hearing. So, I’m trying to think of some creative solutions to keep me doing work for them, while also making a livable wage. 

One thought I’ve had is being an Independent Contractor. I think have a basic understanding of the benefits I’d have to cover myself, as well as the hiked-up taxes. However, I still see the Independent Contractor role working as mutually beneficial for these reasons:

* Doing research around the NP, I figure I’d gross \~$50k/yr if I were to be hired as an actual employee. Add all of the benefits the NP has to cover, and they’re actually paying anywhere from $62k-$70k a year for that position, according to [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/e-club/hadzima/pdf/how-much-does-an-employee-cost.pdf).
* On top of doing graphic design, I’m also a musician, so I can choose how many days I do/don’t want to work to record, tour, etc.
   * When it’s all said-and-done, I’m planning on taking off 26 work days off, federal holidays included.
* If my rate is $40/hour (my current freelance rate) working 30 hours a week (6 hours a day), that means the NP would pay me **$63,450** for the year.
   * This puts me right at the low end the NP would have to pay me if I were an employee (see point 1).
* If we continue using the $63.45k gross income as my baseline, here are the payments I’m understanding I’d have to make:
   * *Self-employment tax*: 15.3% ($9,707.85)
   * *Insurance*: $500/month ($6,000)
   * *Federal income tax*: (\~$7,133.50)
   * *State income tax for my residence*: (\~$3,044.90)
   * My total mandatory payments: \~$25,886.25
      * $63,450 - $25,886.25 = **$37,563.75** **net income**
* In running the math for an employee would take home working a $50k job, it comes out to about $36k net, so I’m right in the ballpark - making a tad bit more as an Independent Contractor, actually.

My big question is: are there other big time expenditures or glaring holes in doing this? Obviously I’d write off my own business expenses, work from my own location, cover my own taxes + benefits so the lines aren’t blurred between a contractor and employee. I’m also planning on using this as an option for the meantime for if/when they end up changing the family rule. 

Thanks so much for taking the time, feel free to poke holes in my plan - I want to know all of the positives and negatives before I present this plan to the big dogs. Cheers!",finance
personalfinance,Best way to transfer my CC debt to a lower interest loan?,"Long story short. I have like 16K of CC debt and 18K on a Line of Credit. I have been paying it down, put my entire tax return toward it, paying like $1000 a month on it. But every time I look it seems the balance just goes back to where it's always been, because I'm paying like $600 a month in interest.

Should I call my current bank and ask for a personal loan, at a lower interest rate than my CC? Ask for a credit increase on my loan of credit to transfer my CC to that? Apply for a loan from another institution? 

Any advice helps.",finance

personalfinance,Paying Extra in Mortgage Payments vs. Putting it in the Stock Market,"Hi folks,

&amp;#x200B;

My partner and I are in the very fortunate position that we can pay an extra $400 into our mortgage every month. (We ended up paying a home that was smaller than we could afford, and we are happy with the decision). 

&amp;#x200B;

Because our mortgage is at an interest rate of 4%, and the market, over the long-term returns \~7%, I feel like we have the option of saying ""I want a risk-free 4% return, or a risky 7%"" return on those $400. If we can put away the $400 for 20 years, does it make sense to put the $400 into the market. 

&amp;#x200B;

According to ([https://www.calculators.org/savings/monthly.php](https://www.calculators.org/savings/monthly.php)), $400 per month for 20 years at 7% comes out to $209,747, while at 4% it comes out to $147,287, a difference of $62,460.

personalfinance,Options for managing funds from a pension?,"Hey all,

My wife used to work for a hospital that provided a pension for hourly employees. Upon leaving employment, they give you 3 options if your balance in the fund is &lt;10k. Her balance was ~9750, so we can choose what to do. 

Option 1 is leave it in the fund, they pointed out that retiring at target date (age 65) would net her ~$200 a month.

Option 2 is to rollover to an eligible retirement account, they will withhold 20% for federal taxes, and 4% for state taxes automatically and assist you with the rollover process.

Option 3 is to cash it out immediately. They will withhold the same amount in taxes (24%) but also levy a 10% additional penalty, providing the rest as a lump sum.

We are really looking at best option between 1/2, the rollover would allow us to manage this fund ourselves, but these would then be post-tax earnings, and we're currently above the income limit for Roth. Option 1 we could just set it and forget it and know we had $200 extra coming in when she's 65.

Any additional thoughts or considerations?",finance

personalfinance,I got pressured into buying a $25k with no money in the bank,"From 18 to 25 I drove my parents 1999 Toyota Camry. Car was paid off, and after driving in for 7 years it got totaled. 


My parents refused to get it fixed and took me to the Honda dealership; my dad put down $8,000 as a downpayment, and the deal was I give him the monthly note, pay for car insurance, and then a 1 year later, transfer the title over to me.

The biggest reason my parents did this was because the car note was going to be at a 12 percent interest rate. I refused, and at that point I was considering a used car. Once I took my parents to the dealer with me, my mother was complaining to my dad about how I need a bunch of extra bells and wistles and ended up originally wanting to spend $18k and going up to $25k. 

Regardless, the deal was horrible.

With no money in the bank, and taking on an auto loan without a lengthy job in the books was horrid and after looking at the numbers here is how making this decision 3 years ago was a terrible financial decision

1. Monthly Income: $2800
2. Car note: $270 
3. Insurance: $115 
4. Gas: $120 
5. Rent: $1150 (recently went down to $655)

After rent and the car was paid for, I barely had any money left over to account for anything else. During the time, I guess it was my parents belief that I would eventually pay the car off FIRST then move out. At 27 years old, it was unreasonable for me to still stay at home with mom and dad and report to them what I am doing. 

----- 

Almost $5,000 a year is going towards a car. 

My take-home pay for the last 3 years has also been $33k. The car was worth more than half of my income when it was bought, but I still allowed my parents to coerce me into a horrible financial deal that still slaps me in the face today.

To date, I owe roughly $5,900 on a 2016 Honda Civic EX-L and once it is paid off I am keeping the damn car until the wheels fall off. 

TL;DR - I got sucked into a bad financial deal with my parents because I ALLOWED it.",finance

# **The Fed is about to cut rates to protect the economy, even though most signs are strong  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/26/fed-to-cut-rates-for-first-time-since-2008-jobs-data-should-be-strong.htmll)**
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade Wednesday, a pre-emptive move as concerns rise about the impact of the trade wars and a slowing global economy.
*****
&gt; Friday’s July jobs report should show that the U.S. economy is still strong, with 170,000 nonfarm payrolls being added and an extremely low unemployment rate of 3.7%, according to Refinitiv. That follows this past Friday’s report of second -quarter GDP, which grew at a better than expected 2.1% but showed clear signs of impact from tariffs and trade friction.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new highs, as investors anticipated a Fed rate cut, and also a better-than-expected earnings season. Earnings growth is slightly positive so far this quarter, but that could improve with another big wave of earnings in the week ahead, when nearly a third of the S&amp;P 500 report.
*****
&gt; Apple, Exxon Mobil, Procter and Gamble, Merck, General Motors and Verizonare among companies reporting. Beyond Meat, the hot IPO with a market cap bigger than a quarter of companies in the S&amp;P 500, reports Monday. Seventy-five percent of companies have beaten estimates so far and 60% beat revenue expectations.
*****
&gt; It will be the Fed though that will likely have the most market impact, and strategists are looking for the central bank to signal it is open to future cuts but not necessarily promising them. Economists mostly expect anywhere from one to three rate cuts this year, but there is near consensus that this first cut will be a quarter percentage point.
*****
&gt; “The market is pricing in a 25 basis point cut,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist with Prudential Financial. “We already know of two Fed presidents who don’t think we need it, so there’s obviously going to be a discussion, with the strong data. The chairman, who is in the camp that we need to have an insurance cut, is going to make the case that while the economic data are all gaining strength, they are still worried about weakening conditions, due to uncertainty regarding trade and tariffs.”
*****
&gt; The strains of the trade war and tariffs showed up in a reduction in gross private domestic investment in second quarter GDP of 5.5%, the worst decline in that category since 2015. Within that, exports fell 5.2%. The decline in business investment wiped a full percentage point from the final GDP number.
*****
&gt; The Fed has boxed itself into moving rates, says JP Morgan US chief eocnomist
*****
&gt; In the last several weeks, as the Fed meeting edged closer, economic data began to show signs of improvement from a soft patch this winter and spring. Consumers, who comprise 70% of the economy, strengthened in the second quarter, with consumption up 4.3%, its best reading since the fourth quarter of 2017.
*****
&gt; The Fed “will signal they’re’ going to go on if conditions warrant it. It’s clear the chairman and his cohorts are not looking at incoming data in the sense that they are data dependent. They made it clear they want to inoculate the economy,” Krosby said.
*****
&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint, said he expects the Fed to cut rates just once and then stop.
*****
&gt; “They’re not going to say that we’re done. I think it would be too much of a leap for the market. My sense is they’ll leave the door open, but their aim is not going to be locked in for the next meeting. It’s clearly a function of how the data play out,” Stanley said. “I’m just more optimistic than they are about the how things are going to evolve.”
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching for headlines on trade in the coming week, as the U.S. delegation returns to China for the first round of face to face talks since May.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 7/26/19

&gt; The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index kicked off this week's busy macroeconomic data slate on a disappointing note with a still negative reading that was below forecasts. Weak data continued to come in on Tuesday with FHFA home price growth slowing to 0.1% and the Richmond Fed Manufacturing index reaching a multi-year low. Existing Home Sales also came in weaker. Preliminary Markit PMIs released on Wednesday came in below estimates and weaker than the previous month while the services portion saw the opposite results. The release of preliminary Durable Goods and Capital Goods on Thursday came in much stronger than both expectations and the May release. Meanwhile, weekly labor data once again came in at a multi-month low. We ended the week with stronger than expected GDP data, but it still showed the economy slowed versus the first quarter. Overall, economic data didn't have the greatest of weeks with over half of the indicators released weakening or coming in below estimates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-Eco1.png))**

&gt; Next week is a busy one when it comes to macroeconomic developments. The week starts off quiet with only the Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity Index out on Monday. It is expected to rebound to -5 off its multiyear low of -12.1 from its June release. Things pick up on Tuesday with the release of personal income and spending data which are forecast to fall 0.1%. PCE data, Pending Home Sales, and consumer confidence will also be out that day. Ahead of Friday's Nonfarm Payrolls report, which is expected to show 170K added jobs in July, on Wednesday ADP will release their own employment data. Also on Wednesday, there will be an FOMC rate decision followed by a presser by Fed Chair Powell. Markets are anticipating a 25 bps cut in this meeting. After digesting the results of this meeting, on Thursday ISM will release their manufacturing report for July. In addition to the NFP report, the release of the June trade balance, factory orders, and the University of Michigan's sentiment data will all round out the week on Friday.

# The Bespoke Report -- Global Macro Outlook

&gt; This week we're outlining how we see the global economy at present, along with its influence on US interest rates, credit, commodities, and equity markets. One of the topics we discuss in detail is the strong performance of US GDP in Q2, which in addition to upward revisions from 2014-2018 also showed newly-reported Q2 growth that was far stronger than analyst estimates. Smaller-than-expected headwinds from trade and inventory and a massive surge in consumer spending helped push growth above expectations despite weak investment. With the Fed set to join the global central bank easing party at its July meeting, it's part of the reason to expect that the global backdrop is set to improve.

# Financials Appear Poised For a Strong Second Half

&gt; After a disappointing start to the year, financials were the top performing sector in the second quarter.

And technical analysis suggests they may have more room to run.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2Fva1zL.png))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Financials Outperformance May Mark a Change in Trend, the relative performance of financials versus the S&amp;P 500 Index has broken a downtrend, which we see as a bullish technical signal. This tells us the technicals may now be aligning with our optimistic fundamental outlook for financials, which we highlighted in our Midyear Outlook 2019.

&gt; Financials’ strong performance has continued a few weeks into July, with the S&amp;P 500 Financials Index and KBW Bank Index both outpacing the market thus far. Defensive areas of the market, including the utilities, real estate, and healthcare sectors, have all lagged the S&amp;P 500 since the end of the first quarter. We think cyclicals’ outperformance could continue if economic fundamentals improve.

&gt; “The rotation from defensive stocks, which have led for much of the past year, to more cyclical areas of the market, is not only healthy for the bull market, but should favor active managers who can overweight these sectors,” according to LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch.

&gt; While we don’t anticipate broad market performance to be as strong in the second half of 2019, we believe that an overweight to financial stocks may offer an opportunity for suitable investors based on attractive valuations, a potentially steeper yield curve, and an improving technical picture.

# August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great

&gt; Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.

&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000 which is unchanged.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2c259751b53bc3c3005d4c266dd9fac/b4aa95c4256eed3a-ce/s400x600/345335a8152d24b9b10af91f813c9bf07af456fe.jpg))**

&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&amp;P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.

# Second-Half Pre-Election Year Blues Absent…So Far

&gt; A little over one week ago, we posted updated charts of historical pre-election year performance with 2019 overlaid for comparison. Like then DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are still comfortably above average for this time of a pre-election year when compared to historical data. Thus far earnings have supported a continuation of the rally. A 100% probability (according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool as of today) that the Fed will cut rates at least 0.25% is also aiding. And now it appears the debt ceiling is going to be raised eliminating another market headwind. 

&gt; It would seem the market has nearly everything going its way. Almost, sentiment is running on the frothy side. According to Investors Intelligence, bullish advisors have reached 58%, a new high for 2019, while bearish advisors are down to just 16.8%. Historically these levels have been an early warning. Combined with the historically meager gains in the second half of pre-election years (visible in the charts below), the rally appears to be increasingly prone to faltering. If the market does take a pause and consolidate some of its gains so far this year in August/September/early-October, it would likely improve the possibility of a respectable fourth quarter rally.

personalfinance,Credit Card Debt.. HELP!,"Hello! I am new to reddit and the personal finance thread, but my fiancé has followed this thread for awhile now!

I recently came clean to my fiancé about a serious amount of credit card debt I have racked up over the past few years. I’ll lay it out here:

-Chase Southwest VISA $9,009.85 (25.24% APR)
-USAA Visa $4,218.16 (12.15% APR)

I won’t go into the details of how it happened, but I’m recommitting myself to a budgeted lifestyle and living within my means. My credit score is still “good” (705). My questions are related to the best way to handle this debt. 

-Should I apply for a personal loan to pay down debts (without closing credit cards, just not using them and cutting them up)?
-Should I look into a balance transfer CC?
-Should I just pay down the credit cards monthly? 

I have concerns with each option. I am leaning towards getting a personal loan, because I have been trying to get ahead of the amount owed for the past six months by paying extra on the credit cards, but the interest on purchases on the CCs have made the payments feel pointless (which is what finally broke me down into sharing this with my fiancé). I know that personal loans can carry hefty interest rates as well. 

A balance transfer to a new CC feels like “spreading the problem around.” 

What have y’all found to be successful? My goal (and I feel it can be achieved) is to pay down the credit card debt by January 2021 (hopefully sooner)! Any help would be appreciated.",finance

* Federal Unsub. of $9,342 at 6.6% interest which is now at a total of $9,725

All of these various loans add up for a grand total of about $110,000 that I currently owe, and it will obviously only get higher. 

I am looking into refinancing at least the private ones, but it's difficult to find a good interest rate because of my income information, which is below.

**Additional Debt**

We also have credit card debt from our wedding expenditures. I have about **$2,000** on my credit card, and my wife has **$9,000** on hers. 

**Income**

In addition to recently getting married and finishing grad school, I also just got my first full time position and will be starting at the beginning of August. I work in higher education in Residence Life, meaning that I have a live-in role. This has its downsides, but financially will be great because we will not have to pay for rent, cable, wifi, utilities, parking, and more. These perks come at a hit to my salary, though. We are expecting to be in this income situation (with a hope for a small merit based raise next June) for the next 2 years, but potentially 3 if necessary.

On paper, my base pay will be **$28,500** for 35 hrs/week, but due to being on call for crisis response and attending night-time events, I can expect to make about **$10,000** in overtime pay (all before taxes, we live in Massachusetts). I am also planning to get another job, as my hourly schedule will be a bit strange- just 4 hrs/day, 5 days/week, with the additional time being in the on call rotation. I'm hoping to get another job that will offer 10-15 hrs/week, and I also can expect about $300 a month from various side hustles (Amazon Flex, Lyft, DoorDash). I can't really explain all of these things when applying for loan refinancing.

My wife will be making **$49,000** before taxes as a high school teacher, with an approximately **$2,500** in additional stipends for taking on extra responsibilities. 

**Current Finances**

* $600 in my personal bank account
* $4,500 in a joint account
* $5,000 in a high-yield savings
* $2,000 in my wife's personal account

I know that was a lot, and some of it may seem obvious, but I'm really lost and any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,I got into a car accident. Not sure what to do.,"I'm really sorry if this post doesn't follow certain guidelines. It is my first post and I am fairly new to using Reddit actively despite having signed up 3 years ago, according to my account. Just some background info on my situation:

I am a 24 year old college student/mother. I bought my car, a manual Mazda Miata NA 1991, just last year in April for $3000. I spent around $1.4k to do maintenance on it, tune it up, smog it, register it.. and buy it brand new coilovers for its shotty suspension.

My daughter and I loved the car dearly but, unfortunately, negligence on my part and a repair it needed lead to an accident yesterday in which my car swerved out and crashed against the center divider on the freeway. Myself and my boyfriend were in the car. I tried to drive the car off to the side, but it would not move. The engine was not noticeably damaged as the car still starts up. All of the damage was in the rear and the frame. The metal curled inwards and is stopping the rear wheels from moving.  There were other small damages like some of the interior panels and rear view mirror falling off. Both the driver and passenger doors do not close or open properly because of damage to the frame.

I contacted my mechanic and we agreed that the car is not salvageable and my best option, now, is to part out the car and sell its hardtop for $1000, the new suspension on it, and any other parts people can scavenge for...

The biggest issue, of course, is that I need a car to drive to literally anywhere for myself and my daughter. If i was to manage to sell the important parts of the car, I would rack up $1800, hopefully, which still wouldn't be enough for another Miata. I was thinking one of my better options is to take out a small personal loan for $2000 to help me buy another one that is in decent condition, but my credit is very poor right now as i just started trying to rebuild it from past mistakes (credit cards in high school). I don't have any experience with financing from banks, interest rates, or anything like that because my cars have been bought used. I'm rather distraught over what happened and I am just at a complete loss over what to do. Any advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading...",finance

Due to some ongoing things at the time I filed an extension, and was unable to take care of it until now.

My wife found out that her mother claimed her as well our son as her dependents on her own taxes. She simply said that she needed the extra money on her return. Additionally, we found out that she contacted my grandmother in order to get our son's SSN to add to her taxes, while already having my wife's.

When my wife asked her mother how she was able to prove that they were her dependents, she simply explained that she used mail sent to her house that was in my wife's name (she uses her mother's address as a permanent address).

I am simply looking for the proper and easiest way to handle this situation. My MIL would like me to simply submit my taxes without my wife and son as my dependents, but doing so would not only make my taxes incorrect, we would also be losing almost $3000 on the return.

investing,Stock picks and discussion for bulls and bears (7/29 - 8/2 trading week and beyond!),"Hey y'all!

**\*\*\*\*\*EDIT: I'll be posting flash stock picks and thoughts on my reddit wall sporadically throughout the week. Make sure you keep an eye out for those! \*\*\*\*\***

I will be creating weekly posts (depending on the feedback) with a few stocks to keep on your watchlists for bulls and bears, and for short- and long- term investors. These posts are meant to start a discussion about **individual** stocks, their technicals and fundamentals. My ultimate goal with these posts is simply to share good DD. I believe in good karma and I think helping others succeed at trading translates to just better luck =). All of this comes after almost a decade investing in stocks and now with a PhD in statistics and machine learning skills in the bag. And no, I will never charge you or ask you to join any mailing list or discord. That's not how I roll (you can see my post history to verify this yourself!).

I'm of the idea that, **if accompanied by in-depth TA and FA**, investing on individual stocks has way more potential for profit than major indexes in the short-, medium- and long-terms. I generally focus on stocks that I know well, but please feel free to share your own DD on stocks you know well yourself.  With that said, here's a list of stocks to watch for bulls and bears for the trading week ahead, as well as in the long term. Again, these come from a combination of in-depth FA/TA. Let me know what your thoughts are below:

***If you're feeling bullish about the market this week (for traders AND investors)-***

* $BIIB; $OKTA; $MDB; $DIS; $TTD (I'd consider entry on Tuesday); $ROKU (DO NOT HOLD UNTIL EARNINGS!). These should all print some good tendies
* *Bullish power play:\*\** $CRWD, $GD, $CGC, $ALXN, $CRM, $AYX are all high risk/high reward potential plays
* *Bullish earnings plays:\*\*\** $ILMN (Mon AH); $AMGN (Tues AH); $TWLO, $HUM (Weds AH); $ETSY, $MPC (Thurs AH)

For those investing in the long term, I would recommend considering starting positions in any of these except $CGC, $CRM, $ROKU and $ILMN (these four are included only for options traders **for the week**).

***If you're feeling bearish about the market this week -***

* *Bearish:* $TIF; $CVNA; $IIPR; $PYPL (just for the week, bullish in the long term); $CWH
* *Bearish power play:\*\* $*NFLX; $LYFT; $SFIX; $NKE; $PINS (will likely come down until earnings; bullish *for* earnings),
* *Bearish earnings plays:\*\*\** $SIRI (Tues BO); $SHOP, $YETI (Thurs BO); $RACE (Fri BO)

For those investing in the long term, I would avoid/sell all of the above, except $PYPL, $IIPR, $SHOP and $CVNA. If you're holding $LYFT or $PINS stocks, keep holding!

**\*\*Keep in mind that EARNINGS PLAYS ARE RISKIER PLAYS, by default**

\*\*\*Power plays are also, in my books, a lot riskier/more uncertain than others listed

**Disclaimer:** What I share with you is the product of hours of research I do to build **my own daily stock watchlist**. I trade these stocks (not all, and especially not all at once) because I see (up or down) swing potential for the day/week/month. Of course, trade at your own discretion and use the stocks for your watchlist. If you're feeling confident and see some momentum, follow your &lt;3.

**These predictions are based on the expectation that we will have a quarter-point cut in interest rates, which is the most likely case scenario according to investors right now.**

personalfinance,Best Savings Account for my emergency fund and future savings?,"Hi all,

I am 23, one year out of college. Recently saved up enough money for a 3-4 month emergency fund. Now I am switching gears and paying off my massive student loans more aggressively and saving towards a house. My current savings account isn't doing much for me. My questions are 

A) Does it make sense for me to build up additional savings (for a house) when I have 100K in student loans. Maybe a balance between loans and savings?

And B) what kind of account should I keep my emergency fund (and savings if A applies)? Any specific savings accounts I should check out?

Edit: So I make ~90k a year. I'm paying my loans back at ~1250 a month about 5% interest rate. My unallocated money is ~400 a month. And I already save ~300 a month. I think 2-3 years would be when I start thinking about a house seriously.",finance

personalfinance,Should I use the money I received after my Grandma passed away to reduce this years student loans or invest it somewhere else?,"Hi, first post I have made here.

My Grandma passed away about a year ago and recently her condo she owned sold. This money was split between her children and my parents are giving me some of the money, about $5,000. Initially I thought I ought to use the money on my student loans. I have taken out the max federal student loans my first two years of college ($5,000 each year) and I was planning on taking out the max amount from federal student loans this year (raises to $7,500 because I will be a junior). My initial reaction was to use it toward this years tuition which would allow me to only take out $2,500.

After thinking about this, I was not sure if I was making the right decision. I then thought I could pay off one of my first two loans completely right away, or even splitting the $5,000 in half and using each half for this year and next year. I then realized this really wouldn't be much different then using the full amount this year unless one of those previous years had a high interest rate. Then I thought about setting up a Vanguard or Fidelity type account and putting the full $5,000 in that and adding to that as I go. 

Not really sure what to do or if I am over thinking it, so any insight would help greatly. Thanks in advance!",finance

Does this indicate speculation that something unexpected will happen to the HKD (breaking the USD peg?) within the next 10 years?

personalfinance,Talk to me about the pros and cons of keeping my money in a non-US savings account at ~6% interest.,"I live and work in Vietnam. I plan to be here at least until May, but I will likely be signing an additional 2 year contract after the end of this year.

My financial picture: $45k student loan debt averaging 6% paying $1k/mo, no CC debt, $2k currently in Ally savings, planning to add $500 starting each mo from Sept 1 - June 1. No other savings/retirement/investments/etc.

I recently discovered that my Vietnamese checking account offers a savings account that has interest rates ranging from 5.2-7.2%. Unlike an American bank account, the interest rate is tied to the length of time the money is in the account, but my local friend assured me that unlike a CD, which is the only thing I am aware of in the US that is similar in terms of varying interest rates, there are no penalties to removing the money before the time you selected when putting the money into the account (from what I understand, you need to select the amount of time the money will be in savings when depositing it).

On the surface, it seems like a no-brainer to choose a savings account that could give me as high as 6.4% on my money for the time I know I will be here, especially when I plan to be making $500 deposits per month, and when I compare it to the 2.1% I'm currently getting at Ally.

personalfinance,Changing Jobs &amp;Location: Private High COL (NYC) to Federal Lower COL (Indiana),"Throw away account, but I was hoping to get a few more POVs on a potential job opportunity I have and what the financial impact might be.

Currently working in the consulting industry in the NYC-area (started at this specific job 1.5 years ago but I’ve been in consulting for 7+ years). Pay $90k, 401k is profit matching (around 3-5% each year, but fluctuates), have a 18day 'bucket' where I pull vacation/sick/leave, commute is around 1.5 hours each way due to Long Island/NYC traffic. I enjoy the job, but it's mostly project management/writing reports and requests to do more technical/engineering work has been 'gently' rebuffed since the main office does it. Feel like I keep doing the same thing and the work:life balance of consulting is really fraying my nerves.

In a fit of 'I need to get out of this job', I applied to a general engineer job on usajobs. Freakily, government moves fast when it needs to, and an early June phone interview turned into a July in-person interview, has turned into a tentative offer a few days ago. Pay is GS-11/Step 10 ($82k), 401k is 5% match, benefits are a bit better/cheaper (won't go too deep into it here), 13 day sick + 19.5 day vacation + 10 day holiday per year, commute would probably be 15-minutes, and they're paying off my student loans. Main thing is, it would require me to move to Indianapolis and, since I'm at the highest step, I wouldn't get a raise until I either attempt a GS-12 position or I leave the department (I'd be locked into a 3-year service agreement). Friend in the federal govt said this was a reaaaaaaally good deal they sent me.

One one hand, I could keep working at my private company, continue to hate the utilization vs. billing lifestyle, and keep not doing engineering, or on the other I can move to a new state, make pretty okay money since the COL is so low, no longer have student loans in 2-years, but I've never worked for the federal govt before.

Opinions? Thoughts? Does a lower COL really make that huge of a difference in moving/living comfortably (homeownership was never really in the cards on Long Island for me but now it might be possible)?

- Currently have a financed Altima 2006 which I paid way too much for. Seems like every day it has a new issue. Recently replaced the struts just due to age and may need to replace rear shocks and front control arms. The gas gauge is messed up and replacing the fuel pump didn't fix it. Sometimes the engine has misfire and I believe it may just be the ignition coil which I'll replace. Drive belt squeaks with A/C on. Now the lock on the driver side is giving me trouble and the transmission is sounding weird. I keep up on maintenance but it keeps giving me problems.

My income is above; wife is currently not working as she just recently immigrated from overseas and is awaiting work permit and due to pregnancy.

No credit card debt (Paid off each month)

Assets:

Roth TSP: ~$4,000 
Checking and Savings (Liquid assets): $23,000

Credit: 752 on TU, 729 on EF, 750 on EX ; impeccable payment history ; about $55,000 in available credit from my credit cards.

We're thinking of getting an SUV such as a CR-V, CH-R or RAV4 which are all around $25,000 . The Sienna and Odyssey are both around $30,000+ which is pretty damn expensive IMO. Of course this is for 2019 models. We are open to buying recent year used models. Don't want to go too far back though as I've had enough of car issues on my primary car.

I guess the options we have are:

1. Buy a 2019 model at the dealership and try to negotiate/get a better deal (How to do this IDK but that's a separate discussion). Use pre approved financing from Navy Federal or possibly dealer financing if its a better deal.

2. Buy a Certified Pre Owned/ Recent used car at dealership. Same as above.

3. Buy a recent used car from private party with a Navy Federal pre approved loan.

Along with the above I have the option of either:

1. Trading in Altima at dealership and adding negative equity to other loan (Probably a raw deal)

2. Paying Altima off cash and selling private party with title in hand

3. Keeping Altima and fixing its issues little by little - drive it till it blows up.

I appreciate your advice; especially on how I can get a better deal if I go the new car route. I imagine the monthly payment on an new SUV will be around $400 a month and on a minivan about $600 a month which blows my mind and just seems to make it so I don't save a penny in my budget anymore.",finance
personalfinance,"Buy, Build, or Renovate?","Hi, all. Hoping for some advice on our housing situation. After having a baby, my husband and I have determined that our current home, in its current state, is not a good fit for us. We are trying to explore all of our options but keep balking at making a decision because of the financial impact of the various options. Here's a rundown:

We owe about $275k on our current mortgage; monthly payment is about $2300k, including taxes and insurance. Our house is worth about $550k. Our combined income is close to $300k/yr, but we don't want to depend on that number because it could drop significantly if my husband decided to take a job with better hours. (Now that we have a kid, this is a distinct possibility.) If my husband were to change jobs, I'd expect our combined income to drop to about $180k/yr. We love our city and our neighborhood and would happily stay here for the foreseeable future, so we are hoping that whatever decision we make now will get us through the next 20 yrs. 

Our overall financial situation - Aside from our mortgage, we have about $55k in federal student loans that we are steadily paying down. Minimum monthly payment is currently $962/mo. and average interest rate is around 6.3%. If all else remained equal, we will have those paid off in a year. We both bought cars in the recent past and have about $25k in car loans at around 3.5%. We hope and expect to drive these cars for the next 8-10 years. We have no other debt. We are maxing out my husband's 401k and I am contributing enough to my own to get my employer's matching. We also contribute to our kid's 529 plan and have about $30k in a HYS for an emergency fund. 

Our current options for housing:  
**- Renovate current house:** We could renovate our current house to meet our needs. We want to add some bedrooms and open up some of the floor plan. I have a contractor working on getting us an exact quote for this work, but I estimate it's going to be about $200k. We would pay for this with a combination of HELOC and cash. At the end of the day, we would love our house, but due to restrictions in zoning, lot size, and other factors, this house is simply never going to be exactly what we want it to be. 

**- Buy another house that needs no work:** To get what we'd want from a house in our neighborhood, we're looking at houses in the $750k range. We could transfer all of our equity from our current home into the new home, move once, and be done with it. Biggest problem with this option is that the market is really hot in our neighborhood and we've been having trouble finding the exact perfect house. I am unwilling to go with this option unless the house is literally perfect in every way. I do not want to spend almost a million dollars on a house that needs work or has a layout problem that will bother me for the next 20 years.

**- Buy another house that needs work:** We recently looked at a property in our neighborhood that has a ton of potential. The house itself is not anywhere near what we want, but the lot is amazing. I described it as a ""unicorn"" because it is impossible to find a lot that large and secluded in the city, and yet here it is, in our very own neighborhood. The seller has not put it on the market yet and is willing to work with us if we want to buy from him. I have not yet had a chance to get a contractor out to take a look at the property but my guess is that we'd pay $350k for the house/lot and then another $350k to renovate it to make it what we want. It's not a tear down, but we'd want to double the square footage and would need to update all the wiring/plumbing in the existing structure. 

**- Build a new house on a vacant lot:** There are a few vacant lots in our neighborhood. We could buy one for about $280k, and then build a new house on it. I'm waiting on a contractor to get back to me with a quote for a new build, but I'm guessing $350-400k. The lots that are currently available are not as desirable as the lot with the house that needs a ton of work, but I'm told it can sometimes be cheaper and faster to just build the home you want rather than renovate an older house. 

I know our financing options for renovating our current home or buying a new house, but I'm less certain about how to finance the other choices while minimizing our risk. It seems to me we'd have to sell our current house and buy the new lot/house, then rent an apartment or something while the work is being done. I also don't know if we can roll all our equity into a construction loan, or if we should hold onto it and pay the contractor cash directly until we run out and need to get a loan to finish construction. I'm sure there are options I don't know about, too, and that's mostly what I'm hoping to learn about. How do people do this? Do they just have a ton of cash on hand? Would we be leveraging too much if we decide to build? Is there anything else we need to be thinking of?",finance
personalfinance,To pay or not to pay (debt vs investing),"Hey everyone, I’m sure this question is asked here frequently, but I wanted to hear some specific input on my situation. I have ~$14300 in federal student loans at ~4.2% interest (7 years left on the loans). I have $22k sitting in a whole market index fund right now. I want to buy a house in ~2-3 years and after taxes/401k, I bring home approximately $4200/mo in a low cost of living area. 

I understand that paying them off tomorrow is a guaranteed 4.2% return, but obviously that makes a dent in my down payment fund for a house, and it’s very possible to beat that return in a whole market index fund (7% on average adjusted for inflation). 

I am leaning towards keeping the money invested, but I have such an itch to just rid myself of the $190 monthly payment for good.

Anyway, I went to check the tracking status and noticed there was an entry in the tracking info about having the package held at a FedEx location.  It said I needed to “enroll” to get the details.  I was already logged into my FedEx account and apparently “enrolling” meant adding the buyers address to my list of Delivery Addresses.  This is what allows you to receive notifications via email and mobile about the tracking status or initial drop off of the shipment.  

Here is the weird part- it allowed me to change the delivery instructions for the package as well as put Vacation Holds (stopping delivery’s for a set period of time) for that address...  Keep in mind, I technically have nothing to do with this shipment.  I just know the tracking number because I purchased it.  This seems like a security vulnerability.  Why should I have the ability to enter anyone’s address off a random shipping box I found in a dumpster and make changes to their service just because I have an old tracking number?  I’m not sure if it would allow me to redirect the shipment or not, but this isn’t good.  

Correct me if I’m missing something, but a thief could raid a cardboard recycling dumpster in their neighborhood,  add their neighbor’s addresses as delivery addresses, get notifications whenever they have a package coming or delivered and intercept their shipments.   That or just generally screw around with someone’s service.

financialindependence,Military Couple: 5 years from FIRE goal (Update),"Update to my \[last post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8yu2vu/military\_couple\_6\_years\_from\_fire\_goal\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8yu2vu/military_couple_6_years_from_fire_goal_update/)).

It's been a year so I figured I should make another update post as the FIRE goal gets closer.  My goal remains to have $2m in net worth plus our military pensions and retire at age 43.

**Current Ages:**

* Me: 38yrs
* Wife: 36yrs
* Kid 1: 6yrs
* Kid 2: 3yrs

**Income:**

* Me: $137k  (Up $12k compared to last year due to a promotion)
* Wife: $119k  + $15k bonus for one more year

**Rental Property:** $1850/mo rent, $185 management fee, $1367.68 mortgage, $90 HOA. This ends up being an extra $200 in cashflow with $850 of the mortgage payment going to principle or a net $1050/mo. We owe $41.5k (3.25%) on the 15 yr mortgage and the house is worth about $290k. (Purchase price: $215k + $20k repairs/improvements).  Continuing to pay the mortgage as scheduled results in paying off the mortgage when we retire.  I just dropped the rent $50 to lock the tenant into a 2 year contract.

**Savings:** Both wife and I max out our tax deferred savings options. We also put $27.6k/yr into the taxable brokerage account, Traditional TSP ($19k/yr each), college funds ($4k/yr), cash savings (12k/yr), and Roth IRA ($6k/yr each). Total annual savings is $93,600 when I add everything up. The vast majority of these investments are in extremely low cost index funds.  The only change to this over last year was a move of my emergency fund cash to a high yield savings account offering 2.1% interest.

**Current balances:**

* TSP (gov’t 401k): $684k  (66k increase, 29k gains, 37k contributions)
* Roth IRAs: $226k  (70k increase, 20k gains, 11k contributions)  226
* Taxable brokerage account: $194k  (29k increase, 27k contributions)  I swiped $22k from here for a new car down payment
* Emergency fund: $15k (swiped some cash from here too for the new car)
* Checking: $15k
* Kid 1 ESA: $21k (4k increase, 2k gains, 2k contributions)
* Kid 2 ESA: $10.5k (3k increase, 1k gains, 2k contributions)

~~Still have the same 2 cars (2008 and 2013), decided not to upgrade to a bigger model with the second kid.~~  Upgraded to a new 3 row 2020 Explorer ST.   I spent about $60k on this financing $25k @ 2.75% over 4 yrs.  I wanted to just pay cash, but figured I'd split the difference as the 2.75% rate is pretty low compared to keeping that money in the market.  This way if the market goes up, I feel good.  If the market goes down, I feel good about it since I pulled out money when it was high to pay off half the car.  It's putting myself in a win-win situation mentally.   I thought about this car purchase for a long time and it really boiled down to it not impacting my FIRE goals/timeline.  We're pretty frugal and this is definitely twice if not more expensive than what we need.  But, it's really really nice (400 HP) and not as expensive as some of the other luxury models.

**Life insurance:** No change in policies, $145/mo combined for both our policies.  We each have $1m which will drop in half to $500k/each when we retire and the work insurance goes away.  The $500k policies are 30 year term that take us to around age 63.  I figure with $1M insurance and $2M assets, the kids will be taken care of just fine.  

We currently plan to opt out of the survivor benefit plan.  The simplified math of SBP would cost 6.5% of our pensions and would pay the spouse 55% of their pension if they died.   It's not a bad deal and it's inflation adjusted.  The premiums stop after 30 years, but the coverage continues.   I'd prefer to just not have either of us die and keep the $600/mo.  I still need to do some thinking on this.

**Expenses:**

No major changes to expenses other than the addition of a car payment (580/mo).  I might add a bi-weekly cleaning service, but don't see any big costs anytime in the near future.

* Fixed expenses (mortgages, day care, insurance, utilities, etc): $8743/mo
* Fixed savings: $7716/mo

Extra money left in checking account each month is about $3-4k.  That funded a new roof, cutting down some trees, trips, and extra debt payments/savings contributions.  I could be more disciplined with that, but honestly we're pretty frugal and generally don't spend much on random things.  In our fixed expenses we allocate money for eating out and entertainment.

**Historical Actual Net Worth (updated):**  [https://i.imgur.com/RduzDlc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/RduzDlc.jpg)

* 2012: +$130k
* 2013: +$194k
* 2014: +$110k
* 2015: +$39k
* 2016: +$177k
* 2017: +$247k
* 2018: +$102k
* 2019: +$212k year to date

**Historical Actual Debt (updated):** [https://i.imgur.com/JUfrPNV.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/JUfrPNV.jpg)

* House 1:  41k @ 3.25%  (paid off before FIRE)
* House 2: 371k @ 3.75%  (get down to \~$300k before FIRE), I may refinance this into a 15 yr if the fed drops rates and I can something closer to 3.25% or 3%
* Car: 24.5k @ 2.75% (paid off before FIRE)

**Retirement plan:**

Military pensions are equal to 2.5% \* yrs of service \* high 3 base pay avg. So, 20 years = 50% of your base pay. Based on our expected rank at retirement, this would be $54k each. That is in today’s money and since this is tied to inflation it’d be slightly higher (5 years from now) and would continue to grow each year in retirement since it’s chained to the CPI.

**Age 43:**

1. Buy a nice house somewhere after selling the rental houses.  We currently have about $400k in equity and should have closer to $500k by the time we retire although $50k of that will probably be eaten up in fees when we sell.   We really don’t know yet where this retirement house will be and how much we’d spend.  I've decided I don't want to keep the rentals if I'm not local to the area as I wouldn't want to keep paying property management fees after I retire.   Our house target price is $400k-600k.  My original plan was to just pay that outright or finance up to $200k.    I'm not going to worry about this too much until we decide on a location.  We may just rent for a year in that location before committing.
2. Stop TSP/Roth IRA contributions and most other savings.
3. Live off of $108k/yr in pensions and money in the taxable brokerage account.  My goal is to continue something close to our current lifestyle. Even though we’ll have half the income, it should be similar since we won’t have rent/mortgage or contributing to retirement accounts.  With $2m and a 4% SWR, I'm looking to augment the pensions with an extra $80k/yr for a total of $188k/yr.   When I project retirement expenses, I'm looking at around $105-140k/yr max.   So I think we have a pretty good cushion here.  (Another reason why I felt like we could splurge on a new car).
4. Find an activity to stay occupied. I’ll be at my peak earning potential and could probably get a high paying job for a few years at this point which is my insurance plan if the market tanked/black swan event.  I could also stay in the military up to 8 more years which would increase my pension 2.5%/yr above the 50% base. But, I really want to quit working at this point and spend time with the kids who will be in elementary/jr high school.
5. Begin converting our traditional TSP to a Roth IRA ladder.   I think I'm stuck paying like 22% tax on that money because of our pensions.  But, might as well do it sooner rather than later so the money is available without penalties sooner.
6. Attend kids’ college graduations.  Note:  We transferred our post 9/11 GI Bill benefits to the kids, so they can both attend a university anywhere in the county and the gov't will pay a stipend plus tuition up to the highest state university tuition in that state.  I'm still contributing $2k/yr each to their college funds which is probably overkill.  I decided to keep doing that because the money could still be used for a master's degree, or perhaps the wife and I will decide we need a phd or some nonsense.  We have 4 master's degrees already between the 2 of us.

**Age 62:**

1. Begin collecting social security. If we wait until age 67 it's an extra $18k/yr each for us.  By taking it at 62 it's more like 12.5k/yr each.   It'd take 11.5 years to break even if we waited until 67.   In reality it'd probably be even longer if we invested the money that we start receiving at 62.  I'll probably flip flop on this some more over the years, but it's not like I'm making that decision anytime soon.

**Major risks:**

1. Wife and I getting stationed in geographically separated locations reducing our savings rate by having to maintain two households.  We'll find out .
2. Minimal bond exposure, I’ve been adding some over the last couple years, but primarily am invested in low cost stock index funds (vanguard and TSP).
3. Congress making significant changes to military retirement benefits/healthcare.  The current deal is ridiculously good, I can insure my family after retiring for $580/yr with Tricare.  When we become eligible for medicare then we have to pay the medicare part b premiums and Tricare for Life kicks in automatically to cover the 20% Medicare doesn’t cover plus provides the same prescription drug coverage benefit we have now.  I think the main risk is they increase the annual premium, but even if they went from $580/yr to $580/mo I’d still be thrilled with it.

Please let me know if you have any questions and I’ll do my best to answer!

tl;dr Net worth is now $1.6m ($439k debt, $2m assets), an increase of $212k from my last post.  Plan is to retire in 5 years at the age of 43 with $2m in assets and military pensions worth a $108k/yr.",finance

personalfinance,Is college really a good investment?,"So I ran across this article in USA Today this past week:

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/21/student-loan-crisis-top-ranked-colleges-that-pay-off-the-least-income-tuition/39682401/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/21/student-loan-crisis-top-ranked-colleges-that-pay-off-the-least-income-tuition/39682401/)

After several discussions with family and friends, including a HS friend who is a Biology professor and previously taught at one of the colleges on this list, I'm wondering if any but the top schools are even worth it... and cost of education isn't even a factor in my thought process.

Take a look at this list and you'll find a bunch of schools where the median earnings of students 10 yrs after first enrolling (importantly, this is not the same as graduating) is below $30k!  Now, one important caveat is that those included in the dataset had some amount of Federal Financial Aid when they enrolled... but still... to have gotten into a 4 yrs college and then 10 yrs later have half of your classmates in the same situation earn less than $30k is crazy to me!

My professor friend said something like ""You'd be way better off getting a basic trades job right out of high school,"" and I don't think he's wrong.

Some of this may be down to the types of schools on the list.  Most seem to be liberal arts colleges, so there is more likelihood of choosing low paying work like Peace Corps, Social Work, inner city school teacher, community outreach, etc. but surely that can't explain these numbers in every case.

Further, I looked into my college (not on the list) and found that the 2 yr college in the same town had a higher earnings 10 yrs on than my 4 yr school (only $400 per year, but still!).  That seemed to also reinforce the idea of just getting a job is a better financial decision than paying for a degree if it's not in something targeted and specific (e.g. engineering, IT, medicine, law, etc.)

Anyway, just trying to wrap my head around these numbers as I will be helping my child make college decisions in a few years.  Am I missing something or is the job market really that dire for young people right now?",finance
personalfinance,"""Oldest account"" on my credit score is different?","I've primarily banked with **BoA** since I was 15. According to BoA's free credit calculator (based on Transunion data), my score is a respectable **784**, last updated 7/19/2019.

However, I have one card each with **Chase and Capital One**, which gives me access to their score as well (based on VantageScore® 3.0). Both give me a score of **815**.

The primary reason for the difference appears to be that Chase/Capital One say I have 24 years of credit history. I'm 26. That seems impossible.

My parents opened a California Federal account and put my name on it when I was 6, which later became CityBank, but that's not a credit history and anyway that would be 19 years, not 24. BoA's page says that one of the reasons I don't have a slightly better score is lack of longer history.

For personal reasons, I want to avoid asking my dad about other accounts before at least trying to figure out if it could be an error.

Is it likely Chase/Capital One just have bad data? Both of those accounts are pretty recent and this is the first time I've tried to view my credit score via them.",finance
Bitcoin,BTC Dominance to Continue to Rise in the mid-term,"The fact is that pretty much every single altcoin is trying to solve for a problem that doesn't exist yet. Faster transactions? Pretty sure nobody has a problem with visa in that regard. Low fees? Who cares about low fees if your shitcoin has to instantly be transferred back into fiat at a 20% tax rate because no cryptocurrency is stable at all and wont be in the near future? ""But wait! - Blockchain will save all of our personal data!"" - Wut?

The question you should ask yourself before plopping 100's to 1000's of dollars into any coin is - how many fully validating nodes are contributing to the network stability, and do you see that number increasing or decreasing based on the coin's monetary policy?

Unfortunately, this plays out as a chicken or egg scenario, since the mere fact that a low node count means the monetary policy could likely change at any time, unbeknownst to the holder. And what chance does the node count have to grow if potential node runners don't have expectations of a good store of value?

Bitcoin is the end-all-be-all because it solves for the problem that currently exists today - which a system with an unchangeable monetary policy, with massive decentralization due to it's small block size, with the security of 80 million terahashes behind it.

People need to wake up to the fact that this is why Bitcoin is popular. Not because it has instant, low fee transactions. Therefore this market is highly irrational right now, and we are going to see a massive shift away from shitcoins (all altcoins) in the mid-term.",cryptocurrency
investing,"Trump says China is paying his tariffs, but U.S. companies keep getting the bill","https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-says-china-is-paying-his-tariffs-but-us-companies-keep-getting-the-bill/2019/07/22/cbe5a1e4-aca3-11e9-bc5c-e73b603e7f38_story.html

Dozens of companies have begun shifting their supply chains from China to other locations, although most stay outside the United States, disappointing Trump’s hopes of a large-scale reshoring of lost factory jobs.

The president last week repeated his contested claim that Americans “aren’t paying for” the tariffs. The most comprehensive analyses to date — a pair of studies by economists from institutions such as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University, the World Bank and Yale University — concluded that Americans are paying the entire bill.

Yet for all the talk about tariffs, the aggregate economic effect has been modest. Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. And although some businesses have postponed planned investments, consumer spending in the factory and farm communities most exposed to the trade war has been unaffected, economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch reported earlier this month.",finance
investing,"WSJ: With Stocks at Fresh Highs, Investors’ Portfolios Look Alike. Mastercard, Microsoft, Amazon and PayPal are among market’s most crowded trades","A rally in stocks has triggered unusual circumstances for some of Wall Street’s biggest investors—they are holding many of the same companies.

A list of the market’s most crowded trades includes Mastercard Inc., MA 0.97% Microsoft Corp. MSFT 0.82% , Amazon.com Inc., AMZN -1.56% Abbott Laboratories ABT -0.28% and PayPal Holdings Inc., PYPL 0.32% according to analysts at Bernstein, who tracked institutional ownership, price momentum, earnings forecasts and valuations.

The overlap in the top 50 stocks holdings between mutual funds and hedge funds—two types of investors whose styles typically differ—now stands at near-record levels, a study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found.

Investors are drawn to stocks that have performed well and risen fast. Shares that notched the fastest gains last year are valued nearly 25% higher than normally relative to their next 12 months of earnings, Bank of America’s study showed. Big movers include Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., CMG 0.30% Starbucks Corp. and VeriSign Inc. VRSN 0.34%

Some consequences of the trend were on display last week, after earnings surprises from Amazon, Ford Motor Co. F 0.10% , Tesla Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG 10.45% sparked outsize moves in their share prices. Tesla and Ford, two stocks that have trended higher in recent months, declined sharply when those companies reported disappointing results. Meanwhile, Google’s stock soared after the company reported that revenues rose 19% over the same period last year.

Big surges, like Google’s 9.6% gain on Friday, can make those companies even more appealing to trend-following investors, further concentrating them in a relatively small group of stocks, analysts said.

At the same time, few are willing to risk going against the crowd. Stocks that are comparatively cheap have attracted little interest, according to BofAML’s research. Short interest on what is known as FAANG stocks— Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., AAPL 0.35% Amazon, Netflix Inc. and Alphabet—is at historic lows, the bank said.

“This huge world of investible assets has shrunk down to a small cohort,” said Savita Subramanian, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “We’re all in this echo chamber where everyone goes to the same dinners and drinks the same Kool-Aid.”

This week investors are awaiting a spate of key economic reports, including data on consumer spending, manufacturing and Friday’s nonfarm-payroll report, which investors will be gleaning for information on how the U.S. economy fared in July.

While most believe the Federal Reserve will deliver a 25 basis-point rate cut at its meeting on Wednesday, strong economic data could challenge projections for how much the central bank will ease monetary policy during the rest of the year, a potential obstacle for the market’s rally.

As earnings season rolls on, investors will also get a look at results from a range of companies, including Apple and Mastercard. These two companies are among those that have provided money managers safety in numbers.

Years of tepid expansion have also made investors hesitant to broaden their holdings outside of the companies delivering eye-catching results. That caution has been exacerbated in recent months, as slowing growth around the world sparked fears of a looming recession, widening the valuation gap between growth and value stocks to record levels, data from DWS Group showed.

Yet some investors worry that the concentration of money in a short list of stocks could exacerbate market declines if bad news sparks a rush to the exits. Some of the same large tech stocks led a May selloff that pulled the Nasdaq Composite into correction territory with a more than 10% decline from its highs, a steeper drop than the ones that hit the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500.

Contrarian and value-oriented strategies have waned in popularity in recent years as investors struggle to outperform market-tracking funds. Disagreement among analysts about a company’s earning prospects can also make shares comparatively unpopular.

Kent Engelke, managing director at Capitol Securities Management, has avoided those big tech stocks over the last three years, concentrating instead on finding stocks that are undervalued relative to the rest of the market. Lately, that has led him to invest in unglamorous areas like consumer nondurables and the oil sector.

“I’m miserable,” he said. “The last three years have been among the most difficult ever out of 33 in the industry because we haven’t owned FAANG.”

He plans on sticking to his guns, however, convinced that the rally can fall apart if the Fed eases monetary policy less than expected or if companies’ balance sheets worsen.

That could result in “a really big, ugly selloff,” he said.

So far, few investors seem inclined to change their approach, although many are now increasing their positions in assets that would take the edge off a potential hit to their portfolios. Prices for gold, a popular destination for nervous investors, are near their highest level in six years, while the Swiss franc stands at a two-year high against the euro.

Analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said that markets may be overestimating how far the Fed will cut rates and that trade tensions between the U.S. and China could weigh on growth. They have balanced their position in U.S. stocks, which is overweight relative to their benchmark, with positions in havens like long-maturity Treasurys and the Japanese yen.

“We don’t think the alarms should be ignored,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients. “But we also think the long-term opportunity cost of aborting is likely to be too high.”

personalfinance,Drowning in a debt mess of my own making.,"In essence, I'm experiencing a personal debt crisis of my own making, due to poor choices, lob loss, more poor choices, ignoring collection calls because of my own anxieties and generally acting stupid. I know. I feel like this is the scariest thing I've ever faced in my life, and I need help.

I'm 28 and I feel like I've already ruined my financial life. I'll try but inevitably fail to be brief on the backstory. When I turned 18, I got my first credit card. I was extremely stupid with it, as a kid working a crappy part-time job, I used it to buy shit I couldn't afford. I could barely make minimum payments, let alone pay it off month-to-month. This continued through college.

It was all sort of fine for a bit after I graduated and got a full-time big-boy job. I got my debts current, I was slowly paying down things, although I didn't have a lot of income with which to do so. I was making $35k a year. The credit card debt was about $7K, spread amongst 3 or 4 cards with atrocious interest rates. I was barely able to save money. I put about $1,000 in a 401(k) over the span of 3 years.

Flash forward to 2018 and I had a personal crisis. I got very drunk and got arrested, essentially for resisting police officers who were trying to stop me from running around a main road and getting myself killed. I lost my job. I went to rehab. I was facing two felony charges. (Somehow, this debt situation is scarier to me than that).

I got myself back together, quit drinking, got a job about 6 months later. Of course, my debts had fallen behind, as my income had fallen to $0. I liquidated my puny 401(k) to pay off some expenses, but it didn't last long. My new job was a significant pay cut - I started out at $25K. I could barely afford rent and utilities, let along anything else. My debts fell further and further behind and I just figured ""I'll deal with this when I'm back on my feet fully.""

I was literally afraid of the collection calls. I have a lot of anxiety issues, I get panic attacks easily, and I figured ""well, I don't have any money for these people, why bother talking to them.""

Oh, and rehab generated its own $1,200 bill. So that's fun.

After 3ish years at my new job I'm up to making about $32K, which is more comfortable. I want to get my finances in order, but don't know where to start. I still only have about $400 in savings, and I live paycheck-to-paycheck generally.

I've got $3,104 in collections. I've got $6,319 in closed accounts that are still with their original creditor, if I'm reading that right. I've got $10,445 in student loans, all federal, which I keep current and is the debt I worry the least about. Payment terms are very flexible.

My most pressing issue: A collection agency (Calvary Portfolio Services) with a $1,951 debt (originally a Citi card) is threatening to sue me. I got a demand letter from Federated Law, saying unless I dispute the debt within 30 days, they will assume the debt is valid. If I dispute the debt, they will ""obtain verification of the debt or a copy of judgement against you,"" the latter of which scares the hell out of me.

There's a number to call to ""discuss your account,"" but nothing about repayment terms of any opportunities to reach a settlement. The letter is very lawsuit-y.

I've literally considered bankruptcy, not that I have money for a lawyer, and I feel like it might be stupid to file bankruptcy over less than $20K in (problematic) debt. I've also just started an LLC as a side business and I've heard under bankruptcy they'll take the LLC. It doesn't have any assets in it, and about $2K in unearned income (presale of services). FWIW, it's a drone photography company that the boss of my day-job actually thought was a good idea, and funded the start of.",finance

She does research, and I can't even understand her dissertation. Partly because it's in Persian. I used to be an English lit student like her, but I hated English lit. I originally wanted to study CS, but I failed the SATs, so I had to apply to English lit if I wanted to go to a good college. But then I said ""fuck it!"" and dropped out and applied to community college. Such is life in the third world! Anyways...

2- Foundations of Machine learning by MIT Press. It's such a great book. It has an unhealthy obsession with PAC though.

3- Introduction to Deep Learning by Eugene Charniak: Oh my God I love this book! So simple! So nifty! It's obvious it's been typeset by the same person who did Foundations of et al, because they look practically the same. And both have been published by MIT Press, although Charniak teaches at Brown.

solar,A few questions from a lurker!,"Hey /r/solar!  I've been a lurker here for a while but I'm looking to get roof top panels soon and had a few questions that I'm having trouble answering for myself:

1)  What are people's recommendations for financing?  The first quote I've received had a financing option that was something like 2.99% plus a 14% finance charge and a 10 year duration.  I think that works out to be an APR of ~5.8% (if I'm doing that calculation correctly) on a ~$24,000 principle.  That guy advised me that I could likely do better with a home equity loan or a HELOC but the lowest home equity loan rates I've seen advertised are 5% and I'm not even sure I'd get that rate- my credit is mid 700s and we have about $100,000 in equity on a $500,000 home.  I know that home equity loans are secured and therefore you can claim the interest on your taxes but it still seems unlikely I'd do much better than 5.8%.  Some of the loan companies that do solar loans also seem like they start as low as 5% but again, I'm not sure that's the rate I'd get.

2)  I'm also replacing my roof just prior to the panels going on.  I've repeatedly seen people say that you can claim the roof replacement under the 30% federal tax credit and others say that you definitely cannot claim it legally.  I'm not sure if me asking here will do anything other than get more conflicting answers but having said that- do you guys recommend that I try to claim the roof replacement cost (~$10,000 roof so would be a $3,000 credit...)?  If it's relevant, I'm using a roofing company for the roof that is in no way related to the solar company I will use. 

3)  I recently read about the Sunny Boy and SolarEdge Inverters that had the ability to provide power via an outlet when the grid power goes out even in a grid-tie system (https://webosolar.com/blog/grid-tie-solar-home-system-blackout/).  This sounds really cool but I'm having trouble learning more.  The salesmen I'm talking to right now says they've installed them in the past but have stopped now and he kind of poo poo-ed them.  I can't seem to find out much about them.  It kind of seems like they were optional on smaller capacity inverters (my system will need a 10,000W inverter I believe).  Can anyone tell me more about these or point me to a good resource? My google skills have failed me.",energy
HydroElectric,Can I charge deep cell batteries with this (video included),"I am a carpenter by trade so I have some know how, but not much when it comes to electricity. I barely know the basics of hydro electric, but I now have interest as this is on my property. I have an off grid cabin I would like to get electricity in for 'basic' use. Research is pointing me to some type of a turbine to charge some deep cell batteries as the cabin is quite a distance away from this source.... Am I on the right track or is there a better way with the water pressure?

&amp;#x200B;

Am in the research phase and am wondering how feasible it would be to create a turbine - it flows (gravity fed) 90% of the time unless we are in drought which is rare. I do not know the pressure but it seems strong enough to handle what I am looking to do? Hypothetically, if I were to DIY a system with a budget - how much would it cost? 2-5k or closer to 10k? Is this something that could be easily maintained if I hired someone to design - how would I go about finding a smaller company that could design a system? I am in PA so winter freeze is there but may not necessarily need batteries charge over winter so no worries there - I also have a 10x10 shed (no heat) close by to house systems and keep the elements off of it.

personalfinance,Student Loan advice - Going back to school,"I recently quit my job to return to graduate school to become a high school teacher. I wasn't making a ton of money working in a lab and I decided to get my master's in education and become a science teacher. The program is 3 semesters and will cost me right around $16k for in state tuition. I paid off the first semester with savings, but I will need to take out a loan for the remaining \~11k. After filling out FAFSA I am eligible for 20k in unsubsidized federal loans. My plan is to accept \~10k in federal loans and work part time to pay for my other expenses. 

I also have around 10k in my 401k from my previous employer in my fidelity account. I assume with taxes/fees it would not be worth it to cash that out to pay for school without taking out loans? I have virtually no other debt in my name currently.

My question is, should I accept the 10k federal loan or should I cash in the retirement fund and take out a smaller loan to pay for tuition?",finance
CryptoCurrency,U.S. Tax Implications of Using Cryptocurrency to Buy a Coffee,"If you're a US citizen, buying a coffee or any other goods with cryptocurrency has serious tax ramifications that takes several steps to ensure that all requisite taxes are paid to the U.S. Treasury and the state taxing authority. As an exercise, let's go through a rather simple purchase of a cup of coffee using the cryptocurrency Monero and see how you might account for this purchase in your year-end tax filing. (I am not a lawyer, US citizen, or tax professional - please correct any errors or omissions that you see in the following description)

Action: Buy a coffee with Monero (XMR)

Details: 0.05 XMR sent from your private wallet to a shop's XMR wallet to purchase a coffee

Accounting steps:

1) Calculate your cost basis of XMR sent

1a) Using First-In-First-Out (FIFO) accounting, identify the oldest unspent XMR in your records of all cryptocurrency trades that you've ever made

1b) Calculate the USD value of these oldest unspent coins at the time of original purchase. If the XMR was purchased with BTC, go to a lookup table of averaged exchange data for USD/BTC price at the time of XMR purchase and convert the BTC purchase price to USD.

1c) Be sure to include a calculation of cost basis for the XMR transaction fee as there will be capital gains on this as well.

1d) Repeat this process if XMR used in purchase can be tracked to multiple purchase transactions according to FIFO designation

1e) Update your FIFO records to reflect that these oldest XMR are now ""spent""

2) Calculate the USD value of XMR and XMR fees at the time of the transaction

2a) Using a lookup table, calculate the average exchange price for BTC/USD at the time of purchase

2b) Using a lookup table, calculate the average exchange rate for XMR/BTC at the time of purchase

2c) Using exchange rates from Steps 2a and 2b, multiply (XMR + XMR transaction fee) by BTC/XMR ratio from 2b, then multiply by USD/BTC rate to calculate the USD value of XMR and XMR fees used in the current transaction

3) Calculate Gain/Loss of XMR and XMR fees

3a) Subtract the cost basis determined in Step 1 from the USD value determined in Step 2 for USD value of XMR plus XMR transaction fees

3b) Identify whether the oldest unspent coins from Step 1a were purchased more than a year ago

3c) If coins older than a year, record the Gains/Losses from Step 3a as a long-term capital gain/loss

3d) If coins held less than a year, record the Gains/Losses from Step 3a as a short-term capital gain/loss

4) Pay taxes for 2019 tax year

4a) File Form 1040 to the IRS for tax year 2019 which includes the Gains/Losses calculated in Step 3 as long-term gains recorded on Line 13 or as short-term gains recorded on Line 14 in the form. Include all cost basis, timing, and price details in an attached 1099-K of the XMR transactions used to purchase the coffee. This could include multiple line items if multiple purchase transactions were identified through FIFO as being the source of unspent coins used during the coffee purchase transaction.

4b) Calculate federal taxes owed by determining your applicable capital gains tax rate for 2019 and multiplying by your long-term capital gains from the transaction. Calculate short-term gains according to your applicable short-term rate. Depending on your tax bracket, these may be as high as 18% and 38% of gains, respectively.

4c) Calculate state taxes owed (varies drastically from state to state). Determine tax liability from both long-term and short-term gains or losses.

5) If a gain was determined in Step 4a and tax liability is owed, then pay federal and state tax authorities the owed tax liability.

6) Make four estimated tax payments in 2020. If you expect to continue buying coffee in 2020, then file a federal Form 1040-ES and make quarterly estimated payments to the US Treasury for the approximate annual gains to be made in the underlying cryptocurrency asset being used in the expected  purchases. A defensible position is to take the tax liability calculated in Step 4b and divide these totals by 4 to determine how big of quarterly federal tax payments to make. Depending on your state of residence, you make be required to make quarterly payments to your state taxing authority as a function of 2019 gains calculated in Step 4c.

personalfinance,Should I sell company stocks to pay off PMI?,"I (age 25) live in a VHCOL area and have a mortgage with my partner for $580,000. My income is $110K, theirs is $20k. Right now, we are paying PMI each month, as we put 5% down at the time of purchase. The interest rate is 4.125%, and the monthly interest is $2k. Right now only about $800 is going towards principal.

I have about $70K worth of stocks from my employer. I understand that it's discouraged to rely so heavily on one company, and should sell these stocks. Is it better to immediately invest that money into a mutual fund or ETF,  or is it better to apply that towards the PMI? If it matters, selling these stocks would not completely eliminate my retirement fund; I have about $40K in my 401k and another $8k in a Roth IRA.

This would not completely eliminate the PMI (that would require about $116,000, by my math), but would make a considerable dent in it, as well as make more of my monthly payments affect the principal, rather than interest.

personalfinance,College student financials,"Hello, I am starting my junior year of college and I am trying to plan out what is going to be my best move going foreword.  I am paying for school on my own in the U.S so debt is inevitable, but I still want as little of it as possible. Also, I am taking over the recommended coarse load, plus doing research, and my job, so working more isn't really an option and I can't get a higher paying job, as is i'm already looking at 50 to 60 hours per week with everything (some weeks will be more, others less.) Since I am taking an extra class my tuition might be higher, but the school hasn't taken this into account (yet) so I am planing for both scenarios. Here are my current finances.

Rent $506 / month

power and water $100 / month (estimate, I have 3 roommates so it will probably be lower)

Food $300 / month (anther estimate, If you feel this isn't a good estimate let me know)

Books $500 

credit card payment $75 / month (total balance $1,800 and the minimum payment is $35)

credit card 2 $497 ( I am paying this off in full when I get my refund)

total for 6 months $6,888 (or $8,269 if I pay off all of my credit cards)

Income

Financial aid refund $4,600 ( or $3,600 if I get billed for my extra credit hours)

sigh on bonus for my apartment $1,500 (in the form of a prepaid visa card)

sigh on bonus for my credit card $150 

work $100 / week

total $7,240 ( or $6,260 if I get billed for 3 extra credit hours)

I want to pay down my credit cards as much and as quick as possible. Ideally, I would like to get my credit cards down to 0 but that math just isn't working out. I opened a new credit card to take advantage of my higher credit, it has a lower interest rate plus 15 months of 0% APR. I am planing to play off my full credit balance with my school refund, this won't leave me with enough cash to live on so I will have to use my new card to make up the difference. Doing this would leave me with $2,303 ( or $ 1,303 with the lower refund ) in my bank account plus the $1,500 visa card and money from work. This would have to last me until the first of the year which is when I get my refund for second semester. So here are my questions.

1.) Is it a good idea to pay off all my credit cards given than it will leave me with less cash.

1.2) Is it a good idea to pay off all my credit cards given than it will leave me with less cash if my refund is lower.

2.) Should I consider a student loan (which will have a lower interest rate) or put the debt on my new card ( which has 0 interest for 15 months but a higher interest rate after that.)

3.)  Is there any other advise you feel is appropriate ?",finance

personalfinance,Late to retirement: Maxing out 401K on average income for 1 or 2 years?,"At 27 I'm not super late to retirement planning but I definitely need to make it a focus. I'm wondering if anyone has lived vastly below their means for a while in order to ""catch-up"" on their 401K contributions.

- 27 years old
- $50k gross salary
- $600 in 401K at the moment
- 4% match on first 5% I contribute
- Approximately 5 month e-fund
- Monthly expenses calculated to be $1325; With a liberal margin of safety I'll call it $1600/month

I can continue to increase my contributions over the years, or:

- Max out the $19k contribution limit this and maybe next year
- Effectively lowering adjusted gross income to $31k
- New fed tax rates are 10% on first $9,700 and 12% on next $21,300 (No state income tax in TX)
- SS and Medicare stay at 7.65% for all $50k


So $31k - $3,526 fed - $3,825 SS/Med = $23,649/year

Which is roughly $1970/month. My expenses are more or less locked in for the next 14 months and I have my emergency fund in place. 

While nothing is guaranteed, the company I work for is doing pretty well and I'm doing well in my role too. 

Has anyone taken a look at a strategy like this? Any critique, good or bad, would be appreciated.

After a correction the margin is a little thinner. I guess I don’t have to strictly max out the contribution limit but it would still be helpful to get close.",finance

personalfinance,A way to erase late payments from Fedloan?,"I'm sure this question has been asked before, but I'm finding it extremely difficult to find info on this specific situation. I won't go into too much details, but back in 2011 I took out $5500 in federal student loans, and shortly after made a really stupid choice to bail on all responsibilities for over a year. I missed 11 payments in total, and it completely wrecked my credit. 

The debt eventually ended up paid in full, but the missed payments still stain my score to this day. I've only been able to get awful 30% interest rate credit cards, and luckily I got a car loan with a co-signer (Thanks Dad the high-school drop out with the awesome credit score). 

Every payment I have had since has been on time, and on any credit report I ever get it says I have great scores/habits in every area except that dumb choice. I make decent salary, never go above 1k in credit card debt, Usually pay the entire balance on my credit cards every month, and very rarely apply for any credit, because I know I wont get it. I have 2 credit lines, one for a retailer, and one from paypal.

Does anyone know of any way I can work to get this off my record considering the debt was paid in full, or am I just screwed? I know things like this should fall off after 7 years, but being a federal loan I'm not sure if that applies to this. I'm just defeated at this point, because I really don't know much about any of this crap, and even after spending the last 5 years working to fix my poor choices as a kid I still can't seem to do much about it.

I get this is no one else's fault, but my own, but I feel as if kids are never taught the impact of what these loans can have on their lives when they apply for them. I remember a teacher in school literally filling all the forms out for me on a computer, and I was just told it's what I needed to do. Really wish some change was made in that department, but that's a whole other post.

personalfinance,[Request for help] I am new to credit reports and find myself very confused.,"I was one of the many people impacted by the Equifax breach. Since the breach, I have been checking my report every three months, rotating through the various credit companies. I have a freeze on Equifax, but the others require that I pay to freeze my credit through them, so I just check regularly. 

Today, as I was going through the process to get my reports, I noticed something odd. One of the questions asked to verify it was me trying to get the report stated, ""Our records indicate that you have opened a mortgage in the last five years. With which company do you have your mortgage?"" (Note: I might be slightly off with the wording, but it definitely said, ""Our records indicate""). I have NEVER had a mortgage. I clicked ""None of the Above/Not applicable"" and then got my report, which only shows my credit cards and student loans. Was this question just a trick question? Are there other records they have that attaches a fraudulent loan to me? Should I be concerned? 

The second question I had relates to how my federal loans were listed on the report. I have 3 private loans and 3 federal loans. I had to pay for three years of undergrad with loans, so I have 3 sets of private/federal loans. I'm still in graduate school, so everything is deferred. My private loans were each listed separately. There is no reference, however, to my federal loans. There is one reference to a federal loan, but this is listed as ""closed."" While it does match the cost of my federal loans, it also matches the cost of what my parents had to pay for my first year. I am checking with them to see if they took out a federal loan under both of our names for the first year and paid it off. I had assumed they took out a parent plus loan, but I'm not sure if this would still list me as on it. I should also note: the loan was satisfactorily paid off, so I'm not worried about them having taking a loan out without telling me. They probably did, said we'll pay it, and I forgot. If this is not the case, is it possible that my active federal loans were combined and are listed as closed until I'm out of school? If this is the case, where are my federal loans? Why aren't they on my credit report?

personalfinance,Never look at monthly payments. Negotiate on the final price.,"This happens everywhere I go.
Car dealership, ""So what do you want your monthly payment to be?""

Um, I want to know what the final out the door price would be?

""Well tell me what you can afford and I'll see if we can make this work for you. So how much are you looking to pay a month?""

Why is this bad? Because you cannot compare apples to apples with just a monthly payment. Sure they can make your monthly payment super low and just extend your term to forever so they make more money. Or for insurance purposes you cannot compare that policy vs another one.

Also you should know the true cost of the items you are buying. Sure those $150 airpods at 5 bucks a month on your credit card is easy to afford. But once you factor in that 22% interest rate over how long it takes to pay it off were they REALLY worth the $180+ you just paid?

I feel like majority of uninformed consumers should be considering the true cost of items vs they I can afford that monthly payment mindset. No wonder people live paycheck to paycheck thinking they cannot afford to have an emergency savings because all of their money is going towards those monthly payments.

personalfinance,"College Grad 90K in debt, looking for advice on my finances.","Long post, looking for advice on my future and how to handle my finances as this has never been a strong suite of mine and I’m hoping to get started on the right foot. 

Background: 

•I am a recent college graduate with around 90K in student loan debt with an average interest rate across the loans being about 5%. 

•I am fortunate to have secured a high paying job with a 90K starting salary, full benefits, and a 401K program. Additionally we are given a company stock incentive program which allows us to purchase said stock at a lower price. 

•The 401K plan is the following: My employer will match 100% of contributions for the first 3% of your salary and 50% for the next 3% for a total of 4.5% salary match for 6% contribution. Additionally, I receive 3% annual contribution from the company regardless of personal contribution. All in all, this comes out to 7.5% of my salary being matched by my employer for only a 6% contribution. (401K will grow by 13.5% annually i.e. 12,150 where I only put in 5,400). I am currently at the point where I’m only contributing 6% of each paycheck just to max out employer matching. 

•I recently discovered a mutual fund in my name my parents set up when I was a child back in ‘03. With an initial investment of $931, its current value is $3986 with not even a single penny added since its original investment. 

• My savings/rainy day account has about $5000 in it. 

•Totaling my current expenses (rent, 401K, loans, etc.) leaves me with anywhere between $1000-$1500 disposable income. 


My Questions:

•My mutual fund seems like it has a decent ROI, but I don’t know much about the subject so is this typical? Should I be allocating portions of my extra income to this fund?

•Conversely, should I be prioritizing debt and push most of my extra money into student loans? My father always told me I should clear any debt before investing. 

•Should I be contributing more to my 401K/attempting to max it out?

•Lastly, is there anything else I should be doing with this extra income (e.g. looking into the provided stock program)?

personalfinance,Pay off dad's Parent PLUS loan or invest and help make minimum payments?,"I'm (23) looking for some advice regarding helping my dad (65) pay off a series of four Parent PLUS loans he borrowed to help pay for my undergraduate schooling. The principal sits at just below $38k with an average interest rate of \~6.84% across the loans. The grace period ended December 2018 and the payment schedule is 10 years. I have been helping him pay the minimum payments. He pays half, reasoning that he feels obligated because he wanted me to go to school and did not save up any money for it.

I have a high paying job and just completed a year, so I have a $30k sign-on bonus that is now mine to keep (I had been keeping it liquid in a HYSA in case I left the company within a year), and $22k worth of RSUs that will now vest.

1. avoid paying any further interest on it
2. reduce burden on my dad, no longer having to make monthly payments

I recognize I may not want to pay off the loan principle in full right now because:

1. 10 years of stock market returns on the principal may exceed the interest (though not guaranteed)
2. the loans are in my dad's name and should he die within the next decade the loans would be discharged, meaning I paid the full $38k unnecessarily

CryptoCurrency,"Aergo Project Review - WhitePaperTrail - Review, analysis and ratings","**A hybrid blockchain environment focused on enterprise customers who can run independent interoperable private chains and anchor data &amp;access additional resources on a dPoS public chain**

**Blockchain tech as seen by enterprises**

The emergence of a new technology trend always sparks interest and discussions at CTO/CIO (main IT guy in a large organization) level. Most of these guys have been technicians perhaps at one point in their lifetime, but their role makes them focus on big corporate politics, strategy definition (and sometimes execution), change management and other activities which are unrelated to technology. So they hear the buzzwords and understand the trends but rarely have the time to delve into what they actually are and how they truly work.

That’s why, as any other buzzword technology trend before it, “blockchain” has caught their attention and right now a lot of organizations are looking into it one way or another. Some are looking at legit blockchain use-cases like inter-company data &amp; value transfer, federation, disintermediating some of the third parties that “leech” from their business model, etc.

Some hear blockchain as an auto-magic cure-all for all of their problems. Either way, they approach this new topic in a very prudent manner, with security often being quoted as a main concern related to the public nature of blockchains, which often results in enterprises trialing private blockchains first.

And what’s important is that enterprises are mostly approaching supermajors like IBM, Microsoft, Accenture, Ernst &amp; Young, Deloitte and others, who are tapped for guidance regarding how this new technology can help or threaten them. 

These firms help their customers navigate the complexities on the space and choose the solution that best fits their needs, whether it’s private blockchains like Hyperledger, R3 Corda, modified Ethereum, or public blockchains such as Ethereum or EOS.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/sec7yuu79ad31.png

 

A similar albeit smaller firm is the Korean [Blocko](https://medium.com/aergo/understanding-the-relationship-between-blocko-and-aergo-5133d3854bcc), who supports their customers to “design, deploy, and manage digital services on secure distributed networks”. They started out by building Coinstack, a private distributed system initially based off of Ethereum and Bitcoin that was adapted for enterprise customer needs, and eventually evolved this system into Aergo – a hybrid blockchain solution that allows multiple customers to run any number of independent private blockchains, with a public blockchain for anchoring and resource sharing.

**How does Aergo work?**

The private level of Aergo is made of Aergo nodes running inside the various organizations implementing it. They deploy the Aergo Hub component and run a leader-based consensus mechanism such as Proof of Authority, can have private repositories of data and run smart contracts written in Solidity or SQL-like scripting &amp; Lua, which is convenient for enterprise devs already familiar with these programming languages.

The private implementations are great for running inter-company processes with various business partners and other related entities, or even within large organizations with interbranch trust, compatibility or even availability issues.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/1wec0s299ad31.png

 

The public level of Aergo is running on a delegated Proof of Stake model, where 23 validators secure the network, ensure consensus and earn rewards for producing blocks. The Block Producers are intended to be selected from trusted enterprise partners that can provide highly available servers with top performance.

I am not a fan of dPoS as it does not guarantee trustlesness and immutability because the delegated actors can simply collude and do whatever with the chain records and assets. It does however make for a faster overall system when compared to existing PoS/PoW alternative, which is why this compromise has been made.

Anyone will be able to run a full node and offer up resources such as computation or storage in the Aergo Marketplace for developers looking to deploy their dApps or get access to pre-made smart contracts, machine learning algorithms and other similar resources.

Private instances of Aergo can link to the public chain for transparently anchoring data (i.e. for audit), interacting with public dApps &amp; smart contracts or getting access to blockchain resources such as storage or computation from outside of the respective company.

These private chains can also directly communicate with one another via a Merkle Bridge or receive input from internal non-blockchain systems such as identity management, email, ERP, etc via Smart Oracles. Further interoperability with other public blockchains is a future goal for Aergo.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/qwpmp8pa9ad31.png

 

The AERGO token is used to pay for transactions and marketplace resources such as computing, storage, named entities, smart contracts etc from the marketplace. A significant portion of the circulating supply will be locked by validators to be able to produce blocks. Quite important, companies looking for support and services from Blocko’s experts will also have to pay using the token.

**What is the current state of the project?**

From a product point of view, the code for Aergo’s mainnet is finalized since April 2019, however the network itself is more of a public testnet at the moment, as the team is still figuring out issues like scalability, ironing out bugs and other similar activities that are necessary before migrating existing customers and deploying new ones to it. The 23 existing customers of Blocko have not grown in number since, with only the Hyundai Autoever anchoring their used car data on the Aergo public chain being a new customer.

Blocko has decided to make away with the legacy Coinstack product and migrate its existing and future customers to Aergo Enterprise, tying everything together into a new line of products based on the new Aergo blockchain. Furthermore, they are looking to cater to IoT use-cases and an Aergo Lite product is being developed as well.

From an investment point of view, Aergo successfully raised $30mn in 2018 but unfortunately for the token holders the terrible bear market didn’t help the price, with AERGO currently trading at $0.12, not great compared to the $0.2 initial price. The team is doing their best with listing on decent exchanges such as BitMax, Bittrex &amp; Kucoin and obviously employing liquidity providers to have a $2.8mn daily volume. They recently applied for the Binance DEX and will likely try to win the community voting thingie to get onto Binance CEX.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8nbvoaec9ad31.png

 

From a timeline point of view, the team has been sticking to its initial roadmap, with the testnet live last year, mainnet ready mid April and efforts underway to migrate to the new product and deliver the hub &amp; marketplace.

**What I like:**

* Working product with real customers and a team that demonstrates a good understanding of the enterprise landscape
* The available code and tools are highly [appreciated by developers](https://incodewetrust.blog/review-aergo.php) who can approach the product with ease; smart contract versatility by allowing Ethereum &amp; Fabric (Hyperledger) alongside native AERGOSQL
* The project is moving along as planned, the team is active and the community is engaged
* The team, project and overall approach are consistently professional, which is rare in the crypto space of drama, dumps and dubious exits

**What I dislike:**

* Extremely tough competition on the technology side from Hyperledger, R3 Corda, private Ethereum implementations and their local Korean nemesis ICONLOOP
* Extremely tough competition on the implementation and services side from IBM, Accenture, Ernst &amp; Young, etc and rising ones like Quant

personalfinance,Advise on Personal and Student Debt,"Hello and thank you in advance,

Currently I am in bit of a hard situation due to some poor financial decisions due to debt and just want a better understanding of situations and advise. I have graduated college 2 years ago and amassed $30k of Federal Loans and $20k of personal loans. Beyond that I have $3k of credit debt due to attempts to maintain my car even though it was outside my budget.(Mainly do to there being no availability for public transportation). 
What has made it worse in the past two months is losing my job with no possibility of Unemployment. At the current time I have left the personal student loan without payments since I have no way to pay. I have reached out to place my federal student loans on an income base repayment of $0. Still I am left with no idea what to do with the final debt. Would anyone have any ideas to chime in?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Aergo Project Review - WhitePaperTrail - Review, analysis and rating","**A hybrid blockchain environment focused on enterprise customers who can run independent interoperable private chains and anchor data &amp;access additional resources on a dPoS public chain**

**Blockchain tech as seen by enterprises**

The emergence of a new technology trend always sparks interest and discussions at CTO/CIO (main IT guy in a large organization) level. Most of these guys have been technicians perhaps at one point in their lifetime, but their role makes them focus on big corporate politics, strategy definition (and sometimes execution), change management and other activities which are unrelated to technology. So they hear the buzzwords and understand the trends but rarely have the time to delve into what they actually are and how they truly work.

That’s why, as any other buzzword technology trend before it, “blockchain” has caught their attention and right now a lot of organizations are looking into it one way or another. Some are looking at legit blockchain use-cases like inter-company data &amp; value transfer, federation, disintermediating some of the third parties that “leech” from their business model, etc.

Some hear blockchain as an auto-magic cure-all for all of their problems. Either way, they approach this new topic in a very prudent manner, with security often being quoted as a main concern related to the public nature of blockchains, which often results in enterprises trialing private blockchains first.

And what’s important is that enterprises are mostly approaching supermajors like IBM, Microsoft, Accenture, Ernst &amp; Young, Deloitte and others, who are tapped for guidance regarding how this new technology can help or threaten them. 

These firms help their customers navigate the complexities on the space and choose the solution that best fits their needs, whether it’s private blockchains like Hyperledger, R3 Corda, modified Ethereum, or public blockchains such as Ethereum or EOS.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/xie4xtp8aad31.png

A similar albeit smaller firm is the Korean Blocko, who supports their customers to “design, deploy, and manage digital services on secure distributed networks”. They started out by building Coinstack, a private distributed system initially based off of Ethereum and Bitcoin that was adapted for enterprise customer needs, and eventually evolved this system into Aergo – a hybrid blockchain solution that allows multiple customers to run any number of independent private blockchains, with a public blockchain for anchoring and resource sharing.

**How does Aergo work?**

The private level of Aergo is made of Aergo nodes running inside the various organizations implementing it. They deploy the Aergo Hub component and run a leader-based consensus mechanism such as Proof of Authority, can have private repositories of data and run smart contracts written in Solidity or SQL-like scripting &amp; Lua, which is convenient for enterprise devs already familiar with these programming languages.

The private implementations are great for running inter-company processes with various business partners and other related entities, or even within large organizations with interbranch trust, compatibility or even availability issues.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/sq3khfb9aad31.png

The public level of Aergo is running on a delegated Proof of Stake model, where 23 validators secure the network, ensure consensus and earn rewards for producing blocks. The Block Producers are intended to be selected from trusted enterprise partners that can provide highly available servers with top performance.

I am not a fan of dPoS as it does not guarantee trustlesness and immutability because the delegated actors can simply collude and do whatever with the chain records and assets. It does however make for a faster overall system when compared to existing PoS/PoW alternative, which is why this compromise has been made.

Anyone will be able to run a full node and offer up resources such as computation or storage in the Aergo Marketplace for developers looking to deploy their dApps or get access to pre-made smart contracts, machine learning algorithms and other similar resources.

Private instances of Aergo can link to the public chain for transparently anchoring data (i.e. for audit), interacting with public dApps &amp; smart contracts or getting access to blockchain resources such as storage or computation from outside of the respective company.

These private chains can also directly communicate with one another via a Merkle Bridge or receive input from internal non-blockchain systems such as identity management, email, ERP, etc via Smart Oracles. Further interoperability with other public blockchains is a future goal for Aergo.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/l1jr2cr9aad31.png

The AERGO token is used to pay for transactions and marketplace resources such as computing, storage, named entities, smart contracts etc from the marketplace. A significant portion of the circulating supply will be locked by validators to be able to produce blocks. Quite important, companies looking for support and services from Blocko’s experts will also have to pay using the token.

**What is the current state of the project?**

From a product point of view, the code for Aergo’s mainnet is finalized since April 2019, however the network itself is more of a public testnet at the moment, as the team is still figuring out issues like scalability, ironing out bugs and other similar activities that are necessary before migrating existing customers and deploying new ones to it. The 23 existing customers of Blocko have not grown in number since, with only the Hyundai Autoever anchoring their used car data on the Aergo public chain being a new customer.

Blocko has decided to make away with the legacy Coinstack product and migrate its existing and future customers to Aergo Enterprise, tying everything together into a new line of products based on the new Aergo blockchain. Furthermore, they are looking to cater to IoT use-cases and an Aergo Lite product is being developed as well.

From an investment point of view, Aergo successfully raised $30mn in 2018 but unfortunately for the token holders the terrible bear market didn’t help the price, with AERGO currently trading at $0.12, not great compared to the $0.2 initial price. The team is doing their best with listing on decent exchanges such as BitMax, Bittrex &amp; Kucoin and obviously employing liquidity providers to have a $2.8mn daily volume. They recently applied for the Binance DEX and will likely try to win the community voting thingie to get onto Binance CEX.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ieeq48aaaad31.png

From a timeline point of view, the team has been sticking to its initial roadmap, with the testnet live last year, mainnet ready mid April and efforts underway to migrate to the new product and deliver the hub &amp; marketplace.

**What I like:**

* Working product with real customers and a team that demonstrates a good understanding of the enterprise landscape
* The available code and tools are highly appreciated by developers who can approach the product with ease; smart contract versatility by allowing Ethereum &amp; Fabric (Hyperledger) alongside native AERGOSQL
* The project is moving along as planned, the team is active and the community is engaged
* The team, project and overall approach are consistently professional, which is rare in the crypto space of drama, dumps and dubious exits

**What I dislike:**

* Extremely tough competition on the technology side from Hyperledger, R3 Corda, private Ethereum implementations and their local Korean nemesis ICONLOOP
* Extremely tough competition on the implementation and services side from IBM, Accenture, Ernst &amp; Young, etc and rising ones like Quant
* dPoS public blockchain and trustlessness &amp; immutability don’t sit well in the same sentence
* No new notable customers except a minor used-cars tracking by Hyundai

**Overall, I like it.** The team is highly professional, they were very successful in raising enough cash to execute on their vision and have since been constantly delivering quality results. However, with no new real customers and extremely tough competition from bigger names globally and ICONLOOP locally in Korea, the Aergo team faces a steep uphill battle for a share of the enterprise blockchain market, which is not that big as of today. Companies such as Ernst &amp; Young gifting $1mn worth of code (Nightfall) to allow for privacy on public blockchains and the overall efforts of most major blockchains to provide enterprise-ready easy to use tools out of the box aren’t helping either. The team’s best chance is to stay the path, keep delivering quality products on time and use their enterprise expertise to bring customers aboard, all of which is happening right now.

personalfinance,Looking for advise on consolidating debt,"We have about $12k in debt between a couple credit cards. Last year, we moved from one credit card to another with $0 transfer fee and 0% interest rate for 1 year. Here we are a year later with not much of a dent and needing a solution before we get charged a 21% interest rate.

We would really like to move into a loan, but without collateral we're looking at a 10% interest rate (through USAA or US Bank). Is there somewhere trustworthy we could get a loan outside of our financial institutions? Or should we try transferring onto another credit card? Any recommendations welcome!",finance
personalfinance,Car Payment and Student Loans,"I've been looking but I don't see anyone mentioned this so far (could be and probably am wrong so I apologize). I have a car payment of 198/month, and I've been paying it for almost a year. I still owe $3800, and I don't currently have a job, so my parents are paying for my loan every month. My parents aren't exactly in a perfect financial place, but they don't want me to have terrible credit so they're taking the hit to help me out. I'll be a college sophomore starting September, and currently owe $9800 for this semester. I'm going to be taking out a student loan to pay that, but I'll need a parent as a cosigner. For several reasons, I can't really have a job outside of work study during the semester, and that doesn't pay enough over the course of the semester to pay for 1 month of my car loan. I can most likely borrow $12000 from a couple of student loan options with my mom cosigning, so my question is, should I use this $12000 to pay off what's left on my car and quit accruing interest on it, or should I just continue to have my parents struggle to pay the 198 a month? My car loan interest rate is 10.2% and the highest any of my loan rates will be is 11.4%. I fully plan to live with my parents for a year after graduating college and dedicate about 50% of my income to paying off my student loans before the end of the grace period, as I have a great fear of ever being in debt. If I go this route, the total additional cost of paying for my car with student loans is around $4900 over the 15 year repayment period, vs $4400 for the remainder of the car loan's lifespan. This doesn't factor in the fact that I'll be paying over that 15 year period as opposed to my parents paying over the next 2 years for the car. 

I also have thoroughly considered selling the car to repay the loan with the money I get as I don't really need it, and it also means I no longer pay insurance. Unfortunately, I've had it listed at the loan value for the past 2 months (2200 under KBB at the start) and  have had exactly 2 people contact me who wouldn't pay more than 2800 for it. I see no value in selling a car I do use occasionally just to continue paying for it after the fact. 

Do I use the student loan to pay off the car loan, use the student loan to make the monthly payments, or just have my parents continue making the monthly payments? 

Side note, I didn't want to buy this car as I didn't want to be in debt, I wanted to buy an $1800 Honda Civic with cash I saved, but my parents insisted on me going 6k in debt when I didn't have a job. I couldn't afford insurance without being on their plan, and they wouldn't pay it if I didn't get the car they wanted. No reason for me to be a jerk and say they deserve to pay it because they are after all my parents and do a lot for me, but they typically make poor financial decisions and I feel like it is mostly their fault they're stuck paying this loan. No matter what ends up being the best option, they probably won't pick it because they don't trust my financial decisions, but at least I'll have another available option to show what I wanted to do.",finance
economy,Are real negative rates really counter-intuitive?,"In 2018 Swiss National Bank **earned** [2bn of Swiss francs](https://www.snb.ch/en/mmr/reference/annrep_2018_komplett/source/annrep_2018_komplett.en.pdf) by charging Swiss commercial banks for holding reserves. 2bn Swiss francs were then contributed to Swiss federal and state governments.

The logic behind this: *Swiss franc is a safe financial asset. Banks that prefer hoarding this asset consume a service provided by Swiss nation and its taxpayers, which eventually delivers the safety of this asset. They pay the price for keeping the reserves and the proceeds go to the government.*

In 2018 Federal Reserve System **paid** [up to 38 bn of US dollars](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/combinedfinstmt2018.pdf) to US commercial banks for holding reserves. This was eventually funded by the US taxpayer.

personalfinance,First time home purchase with 5% down payment in Seattle/Bellevue? Buy now or wait until savings reach 20% down?,"We are a couple who are in our mid 30s and have stable jobs. We have been wanting to buy a home for a while but had a hard time striking a balance between keeping up with the ever increasing rents/expenses and ability of saving 20% for down payment. However, right now we both have very stable jobs and with recent promotions we both are able to make decent money. Our combined salary is close to 180K. We don't have any major debts other than a 10K car loan. We have saved enough money to be able to make a 5% down payment + closing costs on a decent house (around $500K-$550K) with some left over emergency funds. 

Is it smart to purchase a first home with 5% down ? We understand that it will come at a cost of paying mortgage insurance until we repay 20-22%. This might a long time since the most of the early payments go towards interest. With our income we believe we can keep paying a little more than the minimum payment to get to that 20% number sooner. However, we might still end up paying mortgage insurance for quite a while. 

 Every realtor recommend buying now due to lower rates. But 5%  down will come with a penalty of mortgage insurance and higher interest rates. These two seem to offset the ""lower rates"" argument. I am not sure if we should wait until we have more savings or buy a cheaper home (at the cost of a longer commute) or buy now.

We own both our cars and are fully paid off. We are not luxurious and try to live frugally and prioritize finances as best as possible. 

Goals:
1. GET OUT OF DEBT ASAP
2. We also want to get married and have a small intimate wedding with family but our families cannot afford to contribute much bc we both come from impoverished hispanic households and are also 1st gen Americans. 
3. We also want to save for a house downpayment and start a family in the next 2 years.

Based on our current financial situation, it all seems impossible unless we find higher paying jobs which have been extremely difficult to get. Before this job I was unemployed for 4 months and extensively applied to jobs on the daily. Which is when I ended up accumulating credit card debt due to that and car repair.

We are both considering doing a career pivot into doing things we are better and more passionate about that can be fulfilling and financially stable. I want to go into IT management route and she wants to become a bilingual teacher ( salaries start at 56K in most Texas schools). We have also considered moving to Austin bc of the better opportunities for me in Tech there but housing costs are blowing up bc of Silicon valley folk moving there making it more expensive and harder for us to get there.  We have also considered getting our Masters but we dont want to accumulate 40K more debt....

Regarding my current job, I've been working there for about 1.5 years and cannot stand being here much longer due to office politics, stress caused of too much work and lack of resources ( just me and my boss building 4 applications at the same time with no one else to help), and no potential for career growth or advancement plus low compensation. Only here for the experience to which I have 5 years in IT support and 3 years in soft dev.

Im currently searching for new job opportunities as a Technology Business Analyst or Associate IT Project Manager since my skillset is stronger in project development rather than coding. Will be completing my SCRUM Master certification in August for better chances at finding work. Been looking for a new role for over 2 months with no leads or success so far. On the verge of quitting without waiting to get a new job bc boss seems to be contemplating on firing me bc he thinks I'm not ""doing enough"". I also recently discovered after extensive neurological exams with 2 different Psychologist practices that I have Tourrettes disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD, to which all have not affected my work much in the past until I started this job and makes my chances of getting another harder.

We have both been doing some research on managing our finances, budgeting better, and debt elimination, but there is so much info out there that is just fed to the world because of business affiliations or incentives that we honestly don't know who to trust for advice. We dont know many people around us that are as elaborate with our finances or have an education as we do. 

I know in some cases, we might seem better off than most in some ways but that that shouldnt discount the issues we have in our own circumstance. We want to live out our lives with the possibility of being financially stable and debt free. We want a family and a home to which everyone deserves to build if they put the work towards it but our chances seem so slim. Am I approaching this the wrong way? What am I doing wrong possibly? I dont have much guidance from anyone outside of the internet and my family is not a dependable example for this kind of advice. For those of you that tuned-in to my questions,  thank you!

personalfinance,Cashout Refinance or Second Mortgage for home addition,"Wife and I are looking to remodel our home to make room for our son.

Banking,Why can't banks deny transactions that would put an account into a negative balance?,"When I was young and poor I regularly had under $25 in my account after paying bills.  An occasional charge would come through that I forgot to budget for--say $30, and the bank would happily pay it, charge me a $30 overdraft fee, and my bank account would now have $-40.

I asked the tellers to stop allowing money out if there wasn't enough balance to cover it, and their reply was ""we can't do that"".  I asked why not, and most of them said ""I don't know"".  One said ""it's federal law"", and another one said ""recurring charges can't be stopped unless you cancel your debit card"".

Strangely enough they would start denying transactions after getting to some random amount around $-250--even if they were recurring.

My suspicion is that it's a ""tax"" on the poor and not any sort of federal law.

I'm older now and earn a lot more money--but I accidentally ran into the same situation a few weeks ago.  I accidentally typo'd a transaction amount on my personal account and transferred $1,000 instead of $100.  When a large bill came in later that month it caused my account balance to be \~$-2,900 with one $30 overdraft fee.

...and strangely I see the exact opposite  with my one and only credit card.  My credit card has a $2,000 limit.  They won't allow one cent above $2,000.  If I'm at $1,999 and I try to charge $2, they reject it--and there are never any overdraft charges.  Even on recurring things like Netflix.

We are looking to buy a house around $700K (we live in a very HCOL area). We can definitely put 20% down, but I wanted to gather opinions on if we should put more on the downpayment to reduce the monthly payment. This is because we are expecting a newborn and my spouse will likely not work for at least the next few years.

I take home (after maxing 19K into my Roth 401K) about 6K a month, and my income will stay steady or increase for the next few years. My spouse takes home 5K about month. After looking at some calculators online, the total cost for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage for 560K would be $2600 (3.75% interest rate). Property tax would be $720. Insurance would be $120. This brings the total monthly payment to $3440. Our monthly fixed costs (e.g. gym memberships, cell phone, utilities) are $650 a month. Our discretionary spending (groceries, gas, clothes, eating out, fun) is $700 a week. Changing nothing I get a monthly total of $6,890. So we are clearly in the red if my wife doesn't work and have plenty of room if she does.

Solutions I've come up with:

1) Make a larger downpayment. The question is, how much? It's right now in a simple three-fund allocation and has gotten steady market returns and I'm hesitant to dig in too much into this.

2) Have my wife work part-time.

3) Cut costs, which we can do, but don't really want to do as we've spent the last 1.5 years paring down unnecessary things to the point where we're satisfied with our quality of work.

Do you have any other suggestions or thoughts? Is a 700K house too much for a 150K income?",finance
personalfinance,Co-intern gets taxed less than me (NYC/USA),"Fellow intern and I are both interning at the same company, working the same hours, getting minimum wage. However, he gets taxed significantly less than me (my federal is like 17% and state is 7%, while his federal is 7% and state is 4%). He is from upstate new york, so he doesn't get nyc taxes, but other than that I feel like our taxes should be the same. We're both dependents (because we're students). We both get paid the same. 

Could it possibly be because our families make different yearly salaries? So, if my family made more than his, would I get taxed heavier? I just want to know if I'm being fairly taxed.

personalfinance,What to do with $11k in my late 20's?,"I am in my late 20's, halfway through a PhD, and have $11k of savings available that I would like to see a return on.  I already have a Roth IRA maxed out.

I have looked into HYSA/CD options but interest rates are so low that a 24 mo. return on $11k is less than $600 (that I will then be taxed on).  
Are there better options out there or should I just do a longer term HYSA/CD? I am not looking to take significant risks.  This is my only money.  

My financial goal is to maximize my financial security.  I broke off an engagement last year (quite sad about it) and don't know what to expect out of the next few years personally/professionally but I hope to buy a house in my mid-30's, even if I am single.",finance
personalfinance,Question about joint credit/checking accounts,"I have both a checking and credit card account through the same financial institution. My bank offers a significantly larger interest rate on the money in the checking account if I use a linked credit card account at least 5x/month, and I would like to take advantage of the higher interest rate. 

When the credit card account was set up over 10 years ago, my father acted as a “co-signer” on the account since I had no credit history. Currently the credit card is still on a joint account together with him. He has made no payments and has had no further involvement other than acting as the original co-signer on the account. My credit score is over 800 and I have made full monthly payments on time each month. This is by far my longest credit history. 

In order for me to link the card to my checking account and take advantage of the interest rate, I was told by the bank he needs to unlink the credit card from his own checking account (at the same financial institution) so it can be linked to mine. 

1) Will having him unlink the credit card from his account (so it can be linked to my checking account) adversely impact my credit in any manner? I wasn’t sure if his credit score (also excellent) was boosting mine indirectly somehow. 

2) Is it a bad idea to have him take his name off the credit and/or joint checking account together? Again, not sure what the impact if any this would have on my own personal credit score?

I realize this is a very specific question and have tried to be as detailed as possible. Appreciate any replies or further guidance for research.",finance
personalfinance,I'm Lost and Feel Like I'm Drowning,"Hi All,

I never thought I would be one of ""those people"". The irresponsible idiots who spent more on their credit card than they made in their paycheck. The foresight-lacking dimwits who didn't save their money to pay off student loans when they finished undergrad...but here I am and I have no idea what to do. Maybe like Dostoevsky said, ""Poverty isn't a vice"". 

Anyway: Here is the situation. 

1: I did my undergraduate degree in Physics and Mathematics and did pretty well, but was left with  $23,386 in student loans. (All federally subsidized) 

2: All throughout college I worked and made pretty good money. (If you ignore the student loans and lack of foresight/saving) 

3: I racked up $2000 in medical bills from an emergency appendectomy and multiple subsequent hospital visits to deal with reoccurring pain. 

4: All through my senior year of college I lived in an apartment that only cost $300/month (including utilities!) while I made $30/hr (10 hours a week) working as a private k-12 tutor for math, science and standardized tests. Combined with me spending 80%-90% of my paycheck every month, I got used to living pretty well. Lots of eating out, several expensive subscriptions and lots of dates/drinks. A very bad habit to get into.

5: When college finished I planned on taking a year to do research at a different University before going to graduate school for physics. So I contacted a professor and he offered me a job for the summer, which has just turned into a job for the fall and spring semesters as well. With the new job, I moved to a completely new city where I had no connections and where everything was much more expensive. My rent payments + utilities went up to $500/month and my income went down to $10.50/hr (40 hrs a week) 

6: I have a girlfriend who lives two hours away that I love very much and try to visit as often as possible, usually every weekend, which costs some $40 in gas everytime + dinner/drinks while I'm there. I don't have the courage to tell her what a financial wreck I am because I'm a coward and would prefer not to deal with the situation on that level. (My family never discussed finances and I even posting this here took me months to do.) 

7: I am trying to prepare for graduate school and that requires lots of time studying for the pGRE (Physics Graduate Readiness Examination) which is extremely difficult and also costs $250. In addition to all that, my research job is very difficult and although I am only ""allowed to work"" 40hrs/wk, I typically work 60/70 because I love what I do, and I am trying to show the professor and department what a valuable asset I will be as a graduate student. 

8: I do have a car which I was lucky enough to get for practically free, but combined with my renter's insurance, my insurance total is ($787) due between now and Feb 2020. 

9: I currently have $500 in my savings account. $90 in my checking account and ($1,998) on my credit card. In 6 days I am moving into a new (cheaper) apartment that will only cost $300/month but including the security deposit will cost me $400 for this first month. So in less than a week I will have $190 to my name and an unpaid, angry credit card bill of $2000 staring down at me. In addition to that, I have $20k worth of student loans which are currently accruing interest because I am not actively enrolled in school. As a cherry on top of all this, I am also facing $2k worth of medical bills. 

Total Assets: $190 (7 days from now) 
Total Immediate Credits: $2000
Total Recurring Monthly Costs: $400 (rent)+ $150 (insurance) + $23.50 (cell phone) 
Total Monthly Income: $1,159 (after taxes) 

Right now I am getting hit with adjustment payments from my credit card, dozens of calls a day from my medical bill creditors and the ever hovering fear that I will have some sort of accident that will push me into the kind of red from which there is not return. 

If someone could help me find the path through this maze I would be so so very grateful. I am at a loss as to where I should start. In my head the first thing to go should be reoccurring, unnecessary costs. (Cancelled Netflix, Hulu, Spotify and my rock climbing subscription today) Then I should try to stop spending on my credit card...but I'm scared to do this because if I spend the ""hard"" cash in my checking account and then rent payments come due, I won't be able to sleep under a roof. Uggghhh.... You guys probably get the picture. Feel free to ask any questions about my financial mistakes and please please give me suggestions on what I can do to improve this situation. 

Thanks.

EDIT: As per suggestions, I am talking to my girlfriend tomorrow and will call both my credit card company and hospital to ask if they can give me some sort of deal. 

I also applied for a tutoring job here in town just the other day, but I won't be able to get any hours until at least the middle of August.",finance

personalfinance,401k Loan for engagement ring,"32m. I make about $22k/year after taxes. Half of that goes to rent and utilities, not including groceries and auto expenses. I’ve been with my gf for almost 5 years now and it’s time to take the next step in life. I have over $3k in my 401k account and I would like to take out a loan to finance engagement &amp; wedding rings. I don’t need a fancy wedding or a big elaborate reception. I would like to spend just under $2k overall on our rings. I’m truly a minimalist. I’m not chasing frivolous extras with this hard earned money, but our rings will last our entire life. I truly see this as an investment in us and our life together. We’ve already been through so much good, so much struggle, and so much change side by side through thick and thin. I know we’re both the type of people who mentally, spiritually, and emotionally never quit. She is worth my everything. 
I have experience profitably trading stocks apart from my full time job. I’m financially literate and self taught. I have first hand knowledge of asset price fluctuation, inflation, budgeting, long term investment and how hype effects financial decision making. Reading across multiple platforms, it saddens me to see how fanatical financial traditionalist are so hellbent in deterring individuals from leveraging their 401k, even for major events. I won’t get approved for credit period. I spent my 20’s working for minimum wage, defaulting on credit to get by, searching and searching for opportunity. That was before I educated myself on the nature of money and markets. I’m finally in a very good stable company in a real professional environment and I’ve been quickly moving up the ladder. Things are FINALLY coming together for me, for us.
In my opinion, it is my responsibility to use whatever assets I can in the most creative yet sustainable way possible. I’m so tired of hearing how important it is to leave this “retirement” plan untouched. It’s absolutely horrible advice for hard working yet lower earning individuals who are only in their 30’s. I could very well die before I ever see that “retirement” come to fruition. Why should I deprive my partner and I of something so sacred, long-lasting and meaningful as our rings? 
Financial institutions would like to have you terrified of facing a dreaded double tax or missing out on a tiny fraction of YOUR money, four decades from now. This is insignificant in my mind. They would rather tell you to take on insurmountable private debt at some morally reprehensible interest rate. These talking heads just want more of your cash locked away in their institutions, so they can leverage it to their own gain. The narrative being pushed is one that doesn’t benefit the earner/saver. It seems upper-middle class and above are the ones getting married. I understand marriage is traditionally intertwined with money, but people also have to keep on keepin’ on and make due with what they have. I will always continue working on and searching for ways to provide for myself and the people I love. 

Sorry for the rant, but I’m so sick of hearing disconnected talking heads tell me about how they have the answers for my financial life, even though we’re multiple tax brackets apart with radically different life opportunities. What does reddit think? Should I dip into the 401k to make it happen, or do you guys have a better practical idea?",finance

personalfinance,$11k credit card debt. Does this payoff plan make sense?,"I have $11k on one credit card, with a $23k limit. I have student loans but am not concerned about those at the moment given that I am still a student.

My take-home pay is $23k for the year (i.e., through June 2020). My minimum payment is about $230, with about half of that covering my finance charge (interest rate is 12.65%). If I cut every possible corner in my budget, I may be able to do a $350 payment on my base salary. I live in a major metropolitan area, my rent is relatively cheap, I have a roommate, and my car is paid off.

Right now, it seems like trying to go the balance transfer route doesn’t make sense because I a.) don’t make nearly enough to pay off my debt in the ~18 month 0% window and b.) I have never heard of a transfer limit of $10k or more. Here’s my plan:

1. Budget and pick up side gigs as much as possible, pay aggressively, and get under the 30% utilization ratio (so down to about $6500) by summer 2020. This feels like a tall order.

2. When my salary goes up in Aug/Sep 2020 (to about $50k), apply for a balance transfer for remaining debt and use increased salary to pay off the balance by the time my student loan grace period ends.

Working in my favor: 
1. I do have $1,000 in savings (though I will need to eat into this throughout the year) 
2. My credit score is currently fine (700 per Mint) 

Does this plan make sense? Anything else I can/should be doing?

We have discussed what we need in a car, and will need to come up with about 10k in addition to the insurance check we received. 

A couple of years ago I purchased my first home with a 30 year fixed mortgage at 4.25% APR. I also pay about $74/month in mortgage insurance. After the two years, the home value has increased and interest rates have dropped.

I'm fielding offers right now, but it looks like 3.75 - 3.85% APR should be possible with little to no closing fees (title, lender, etc). It also looks like I should be able to secure an option without mortgage insurance. In total, I'll be looking at a reduced monthly payment of $230.

I'm thinking the best way to finance the 10k will be to look for a personal loan where the monthly payment will be less than the monthly savings on the refinance. 

I've never refinanced before, what are the gotcha's I should look out for. Is there a better way I should finance the vehicle?

The original debt was on a Discover at 20% interest. Yikes. I applied for a Amex credit card balance transfer (0% for 15 months, 0% balance transfer fee, 0% annual fee) and was approved to transfer $3500 of it. So now I have about $7k on the Discover. 

I called today to ask about lowering the interest rate. They told me this would only apply to future purchases, not the balance I carry. They offered to enroll me in a program where if I pay more than the minimum payment, my interest rate is reduced by 5% (I think? he was confusing me.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Where should these things fall on the chart?","First, let me give you the full picture:

* 37 years old
* $98K Salary
* After Tax, Insurance, Child support, 401K and 401K loan repayment, I bring home $935 a week 
* Monthly bills- $2168 (including gas and groceries, haircuts and clothing)

* $1500 in checking
* Own Car, 2011 Accord valued at $8K. Paid off

* 36K in 401k contributing $130 per week (9.77% fixed income, 34.2% Large US Equity, 27.39% Small/Mid US Equity, 28.64% International Equity)
* Credit Score 620
* No Credit Cards
* 3 Collection accounts for medical bills totaling $2500
* 401K Loan Amount $9.2K at 5% interest (repaying at $80 a week, final payment date of 12/03/2021)

On the flow chart I am on the step where I am increasing my emergency fund to 3-6 months of bills.

**Question 1:**  I have heard that having a 401K loan is like the Worst. Thing. Ever. Should I be focusing on repaying that first even though its a 5% debt? Should i treat it as high interest debt since I am losing the money it would generate having it invested in mutual funds? (so far I have had a 17% return in 2019) 

**Question 2:** medical debt has no interest rate, so I don't know where to put repaying the collection accounts on the flow chart. These accounts are hurting my credit which leads me to question 3.

**Question 3:** I Don't see anything about building credit on the flow chart. Should I get a secured credit card to build my credit while I am working on everything else, or should that come later on the flow chart?

Edit: **Question 4:** at what point on the chart should I think about refinancing my home to a 15yr, lower interest rate?

Banking,Online bank Green Dot reveals savings account with a rate 30 times the national average - offering new customers a 3% annual rate on its savings account and 3% cash back on all purchases for the debit card,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/30/online-bank-green-dot-reveals-savings-account-with-a-rate-30-times-the-national-average.html

The branchless bank is looking to usher in new customers with a 3% annual rate on its savings account and 3% cash back on all purchases for the debit card.

Green Dot founder and CEO Steve Streit said despite being 30 times the national average and above the current Fed Funds rate, the 3% APY is sustainable and meant to be permanent.

“If rates were lowered precipitously quarter after quarter we may have to look at it,” Streit told CNBC in a phone interview. “But there’s certainly nothing in the near term that we’re worried about.”

The hope is that the savings rate, which is only available up to $10,000, ushers in more customers and that existing ones make this their primary bank account, Streit said.",finance

personalfinance,"Tryting to help a friend save money but don't know when would it make sense to ""refinance"" something. What's a normal interest rate for an auto loan?","Hi there,

My friend has reached out for my help in making a decision on her auto loan, as I have 6 whole weeks of an MBA-level finance course under my belt (lol). She wants to know if she should refinance, as her current situation is:

&amp;#x200B;

5.99% Interest (not sure how that is compounded, assuming yearly?)

Monthly PMT of $318.00

29 Months

$8,570.00 left to pay.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I correct in saying she needs to shop around and find other terms before anyone can say yes or no to refinancing? If she finds a new agreement that would have her paying a fee up front but lower interest rates over time, would I be correct in using my financial calculator to show her what the future value of her investment will be, and aiming for the lowest future cost?

personalfinance,Repair vs. Lease vs. Buy?,"In my head this is a personal finance question since it's more about the financial decision than the car itself, but if there's a better sub for this just LMK! 

**TLDR:** We have 3 cars in the household right now, and one of them needs repairs that cost right about the same amount as it's trade in value. We'll only need that car for another 2-ish years. Do we repair? Lease and trade that in against the lease down payment? Trade in and buy another car rather than lease? Other? 

\-----

**Longer details:** We have 3 cars, as there are 3 adults in our home that have various schedules and directions. Somewhere in the next 2-ish years we'll be able to condense and will only need 2 cars, however. For now, the three cars we have are: 

* Car 1 - 2014 large SUV - has 9 remaining payments to the tune of about $3500  total still owed (vv low interest rate); we need to keep this one. 
* Car 2 - 2010 SUV - used primarily for a long commute for one of the adults. Owned outright; would probably get about 10k if we sold private party or 8k if we traded in. 
* Car 3 - 2007 Honda accord - 165kish miles. Owned outright, but have been quoted about $1200 in repairs (after having recently done another $550). Also needs some additional repair if I were to sell - paint job on faded roof; repair to window switch panel; this would net about $900ish in repairs on top of the $1200ish in mechanical repairs. Note that myCarFax estimates $1k-ish for trade in and only about $1800 on private market - so not a huge difference, and my thought is that there may not be any difference if a trade in is taken as-is and I'd have to sink 900ish in to get the 1800ish on private market. (Feel free to refute if I'm wrong). 

The ideas we're exploring thus far include: 

* Pay for repairs to the 2007, just keep rolling as is. Pro: cheapest in the long run if it holds up. Con: repairs may start adding up to more than we'd pay or get in the long run; seems to be a roll of the dice re: how well the car holds up and what repairs are needed. My mechanic said that it's usually a reliable model that does well if you keep it in repair, which we have... but that we're hitting an age/mileage where some bigger stuff may start popping up. (I know nothing about cars but I assume they wouldn't be lying?). Cost over 3 years - uhhhh, no idea. Not sure how to determine this realistically, which is the problem.
* Trade in the 2007 Honda (for about 1k, assumed) - put it toward a short term lease. Most leases seem to require 1-3k/out of pocket (some of which would be ""paid"" by trade in), plus $200-270/mo, for cars that would work ideally for the family. Not sure if 2 year leases are a thing yet. Pro: new car, less issue about repairs given warranty. Con: can I break a lease if we don't need the car after 2 years of a 3 year lease (unsure, need to research)? Paying more in the long run compared to the option above if the existing car theoretically held up. Cost over 3 years is loosely calc'd at $10,500 based on 3 year lease plus 2k out of pocket at start. 
* Trade in the 2007 Honda (see above) for a leased car to replace Car 2 (2010 SUV) with, with better mileage than that car currently gets - then driver of 2007 starts driving the 2010. (2010 currently gets about 18 miles / gallon, vs. an assumed, let's say, 26 ish on a new vehicle; at 60 miles roundtrip per weekday, loose math says this saves about $950/year in gas. I'm therefore going to call this a net cost of $8k, based off the $10,500 above less the gas savings.  (Note: driver of 2010 SUV is not comfortable in the Honda due to height / seat, which is why we haven't swapped previously for mileage)
* Trade in the 2007 or 2010 against a purchased car instead of a lease. Pro: theoretically have some value at the end of the 2 or 3 year period in which we no longer need the car and would want to sell it. Con: will we be upside on the car loan at that point / how likely is this to end up being a losing scenario? And what do we do with the car at the end - sell on private market?

\-----

So I'm curious... what would you do in our shoes? Are there aspects we aren't thinking of, or ways to ballpark more realistically how much maintenance / repair cost we should expect with a 2007 honda from here to make this decision? Any and all advice is appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Need a New Bank,"I have been with Chase for a long time now.  I have my own checking and savings account within my family's larger overall account, and I have been recently looking to open my own personal account somewhere more well regarded with higher interest rates.  I have been looking at three main options: Ally, Alliant CU, and Discover.

Ally looks great and has an awesome savings rate, a great app/website, and many other benefits. However, they don't allow cash deposits and I do get cash tips from work so that would be hard to get around.  I know there are ways around it and I would be willing to do those if this bank can offer me the best of everything else.

Alliant also has a great savings rate but also has a really good checking rate.  They also seem to be able to take cash deposits at ATMs (right?) however I do not know if they have an ATM near me (Tucson, AZ) as their ATM finder does not work properly on my computer.

Finally, Discover also has that same great savings rate but also has a $200 bonus when starting an account which I can utilize.  Again there is the same work around that I need to figure out with depositing cash tips.

Do you all have any advice between the three? Or any better suggestions overall?  I do know many people will say that local credit unions, but I am not finding any with an interest rate even close to the ones I have mentioned.

I'd like to preface this by saying  I am familiar with the snowball method, but would like to know if this is the best plan of attack for the current situation I am in. I currently make 55k a year with 1 to 1 match up to 6% on 401k, but am not putting anything into it currently as my school, significant medical, and personal debt has taken away that ability. My debts currently include:

&amp;#x200B;

\-About $28,000 in student loans at varying interest rates, averaging to about 4%. I can break these down in comments if it would help later. It comes out to roughly $300 a month. 

\-Roughly $8,000 k in car payments left, at 4.04% interest. $257 monthly.

\-Credit card refinancing loans ($7,500 at 19.44%, $3,124 at 23.66%, and $2,759 at 8.83% totaling $593 monthly)

\-Approximately $9,000 in 0% credit card debt for at least 12 months.

I am currently filling out the form to take an early distribution and it is asking me how much federal tax and state income tax I want withheld. 

Do I just enter the percentages according to my federal and state tax bracket? If I get those amounts withheld, do I still have to pay taxes when I file?

personalfinance,15 year mortgage vs 30 year mortgage?,"Hi guys, I'm looking for some advice regarding 15 year vs 30 year mortgage.

I'm about to purchase a house for $206k but the seller covers $6k worth of closing costs so the house is valued at 200k. The location is pretty nice area, will most likely go up in value in the near future. Inspector went through and everything is nice and new for the most part, with insurance (paid for by seller) covering everything for the first year. My issue tho is with the mortgage. I'm not sure if I should go with the 15 year or 30 year. Usually I would opt for the 30 year if both mortgages have the same interest rate. But I struggle here because of the rates I'm being offered now:

30 Year Mortgage: 3.75% interest rate for about $1300 a month.

15 Year Mortgage: 3% interest rate for about $1700 a month. However, if I pay an additional thousand dollars towards closing costs, the interest rate will drop to 2.75%.

NOTE: The above numbers are overestimated. Its a little less by like $50 maybe.

I know the usual arguments of going for 30 year but the rate for 15 seems too sweet. Just to add more info, I bring in about  $3500 a month after tax, insurance, 401k, and HSA contributions. I also live in Georgia, USA so the cost of living isn't as high as other places. That being said, I need some input because I'm just so split.

EDIT: I forgot to include rent in case I decide to rent the house out, the area rent would cover the $1700 mortgage I think (which I also forgot to mention the monthly mortgage includes tax, insurance, other fees).",finance

personalfinance,Paying Off Credit Card Debt,"Hello!

I (24) need help with deciding how to tackle my credit card debt. I don't want this to be long but basically:  I have a lot of medical problems and have had many surgeries and doctors/hospital visits over the last few years and it's gone all on my credit card because that was the only way I could pay.  I'm a dumbass, I know.  I have no savings because I spend each paycheck paying my bills and credit card.  I also used to be really careless with my money and credit card but I finally cut the shit three months ago and got my boyfriend to help me figure my life out (I was embarrassed and still am, honestly).  I have been doing very well with joining research studies, selling clothes, working overtime, avoiding tolls, and not eating out at all, cancelling subscriptions and lowering payments over the last three months since I started really focusing on this.  Before that, I was an idiot and made dumb choices.  Anyways, my boyfriend has been helping me track my finances and make a financial plan, but I just don't know what the best option is and neither does he.  He wants me to talk with his dad who works in the financial industry about my best option but I am far to embarrassed to let them his parents know the amount of debt I have.  I refuse to tell them.  It would bring so much drama and ruin our relationship because they would be judgmental and rude.  They know that I have debt, just not the specifics.  That's why I'm here.  I need some advice! 

My interest rates are high and I don't know if I am taking the best approach to my debt?  I am working on the funneling method and putting everything towards my credit card with (what used to be) the most debt and the highest interest.  I have continued to have doctors appointments and such and that has gone on my other credit card with the lower interest rate and higher balance.  I am wondering if I should keep doing what I am doing, get a third credit card and do a balance transfer with no interest for a year or get a personal loan? 

Here is a breakdown of my life:

Income: \~ $2,900 (after health + dental insurance, taxes, Roth 401k)

Bills:  
Rent: $962.50  
Utilities: \~$300  
Car payment (already re-financed): $181  
Invisalign: $198  
Gym: $10  
Phone Itself  through Apple: $60  
Phone plan: $70  
Student Loan: $71  
Car + Renters Insurance: $71  
Gas: \~$30

I have cancelled so many things I should have never had in the first place to save money (Netflix, BarkBox, Hulu, Ipsy).  We left our gym for a cheaper gym.  We called Geico and got our insurance evaluated and got multiple quotes.  I refinanced my car.  The only dumb payments that I have are my Invisalign which I'm in the middle of but really needed and wanted and my phone payment.  I am on the Apple Upgrade program so I pay monthly for the phone itself.  I'm hoping to cancel that in September when the new phone comes out and my year is up.  Please don't tell me that my payments are dumb I'm working on cancelling everything that I can and bringing everything down.  

This leaves me with around $950 to put towards my credit card debt each month.  However, this doesn't include medical expenses (as previously stated) because I am just not sure if and when something will come up.  It also doesn't include my credit card interest which is around $100 on each credit card.  Meaning that I only have around $750 towards my debt each month.

Credit card debt / credit limit / interest rate:

$9,020 / $11,000 / 13.24%  
$3,992 / $12,500 / 21.25%

I have a credit score of 706. 

My thought was to get a loan (\~$10,000?) or do a balance transfer on the $9,000 and pay the other one off on my own?  It seems like my local credit union (who I have my car loan through) has a starting interest rate of 10% on personal loans.  I don't think adding that inquiry is worth it to only save a few percent.  It also seems like doing a balance transfer might be risky?  It looks like I'll have to pay 3% or 5% to do it and then it will only allow 75% of whatever credit limit I am given.  I know I'd get approved, I just don't know what the credit limit will be.  If it's low like $5,000 then it wouldn't even help much or be worth the inquiry.

I hope this all makes sense.  I am just wondering really how to lower my interest or get rid of it while I tackle the debt.  I am continuing to sell clothes and participate in research studies for extra cash and all of that above.  I just want to make sure that I am not making (another) dumb decision.",finance

personalfinance,"New Grad Nurse - Confused by Loans, Help!","Hi everyone,

I'm here because I just graduated from nursing school and am now looking over my loans and my options for repayment, but I'm a little lost on what option is best.

I originally had planned on throwing as much money as possible as soon as possible to my loans (40k ish with only one over 4% interest rate, all through the government, some subsidized and others not). I have recently been informed about the loan forgiveness program through the government. Apparently if I keep working for a nonprofit (my current hospital position qualifies me for this) for ten years, I can apply for IBR loan repayment through PAYE and REPAYE, get the standard repayment plan, and my balance remainder is forgiven in 10 years. I have to also fill out my PSLF form and refill it out every year after that.

I'm nervous about this option for a few reasons. One, even though it lowers my monthly payments by like 80% of what I had intended to throw at these loans, and that's cool, Trump has threatened to get rid of this program multiple times. I don't know if there is a way to be grandfathered through the program if this should happen, but the interest accrued over 10 years just to have the program cancelled isn't great. Two, I don't know if you have to continuously work to qualify but I'm concerned about this - what if I ever take time off for maternity leave, or travel? Part of me is considering being done with school from here on out, and the other part of me is looking at CRNA school or FNP school so that I can make more starting pay. This schooling could require 3 years of no working, which, if I understand the program right, would ruin my loan repayment plan. If it doesn't somehow, would my CRNA or FNP loans be forgiven too? I'm just really confused about this process. Do my payments increase with time? What if I go into a private practice and don't finish my ten years? I don't know, there seems a lot of grey space here that I don't understand. Three, it seems like if I am ever fired or employed by a for-profit hospital, can I lose out on this benefit? That makes me nervous too.

Right now, I plan on paying off my one higher interest loan sooner rather than later just to get rid of it...but what next?

Can anyone offer some feedback? I just want to settle on a choice and run with it, but I don't want to lose out on a few thousand dollars that I could have saved through being forgiven those debts. Thanks so much!",finance

I have always had in the back of my mind that a new car is on the horizon. I was hoping the Accord would last me until the end of this year as I may be moving to the west coast in the near future. 

During the winter last year 2 of my window motors broke and required replacing. In April I had all 4 brake pads, rotors, and calipers replaced which ran me towards $1,200.00. The brakes going have been a continual issue with this car. Now the AC is broken and the estimate could run me $300-$1,200 for repairs. Please view the remainder of this post assuming I am moving forward with a replacement vehicle as opposed to the AC repair (which I may do as a cheap stop gap solution).

So this is where I'm unsure about. If I get the $20,000, I'd apply it to the Lending Club loan and free up $413 of cash flow a month. This would give me a little over $1,000 cash flow a month to pay off other debt faster. But I won't be able to move if I choose to. I've been wanting to move out of my neighborhood and live closer to work. I commute about an 1-1.5 hours to work (50 miles) and it includes tolls.

personalfinance,Should I add another credit card?,"Hello all! A little backstory on the situation. I currently have what credit karma considers excellent credit with two credit cards and an auto loan. As far as my credit cards go with building credit I've almost always just purchased gas, alternating between cards and paying them completely off each month. One card has no cash back and the other has I believe 1% cash back on purchases. Recently I've received a pre approved offer from my bank for a rewards card with 4% cash back for gas, which is primarily what I purchase with these cards. I also might add a significantly lower interest rate than the other two cards. Would the benefit of increased cash back outweigh the hit my credit score will take? Do you believe taking the card is worth it? Thanks in advance.",finance

Bitcoin,Putting my money where my mouth is...,"New username for this one..
Well, I'm doing it. For better or worse. I'm all in.

I just refi-ed my house, and putting my equity in BTC. I'm sure many of you will tell me that I'm nuts. Maybe you are right, but I think the math is pretty solid.

I don't day trade. I buy and hold. Don't need a lambo and I don't expect to get rich overnight. Yes, I did my research. Yes, I diversified my investments. If this fails, it'll hurt but I won't be homeless. I'll just retire a little later.

If it succeeds? Let's define success. I have lived in the same house for 20+ years. I bought a repo in a nice neighborhood for cheap and put a lot of sweat into it over the years, repairing and remodeling. I built of equity and worked hard to pay down the loan. In planning for retirement in a few years, I was reviewing my finances, and figured that the biggest investment in my life (my house) had a large amount of money just sitting there, as equity, not helping me get any closer to retirement. With mortgage interest rates near record lows and being one of the few tax deductions that I have, I thought, why not take advantage of this.

A couple of years ago, I started dabbling in BTC and ETH. Through it's ups and downs, BTC has been the best performing investment that I have ever had. I'm not high on hopium. I just understand how Bitcoin solves the problem of low friction, cross-border financial transactions, big and small. I think there's some ""there"" there.

So, I'm literally putting my money where my mouth is. If, BTC teaches $33k, my house is paid off. Success! If it reaches $115k, I'm retired. Success! But, if it only has a 4% annual return, it is still more than than it was earning before. Success.

My horizon is 12 years. Will I reach my goal before then? I absolutely think so. With a halving in 2020 and 2024, I suspect I'll hit those numbers way sooner. If not, I'll have lots of stories to tell.

I'm not suggesting that anyone follow my lead. You do you. But, this is the path I've chosen. 

I'm grateful for my wife, who has patiently listened to me ramble about hashing, halving and hodling. She finally, graciously, agreed to this plan. I hope that her trust is well placed.

Not much more to say. My adventure begins now. I'll keep you all updated as we progress. I'm grateful for this current dip.

Happy hodling!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Getting married next year, fiancee has a ton of CC debt.","My soon-to-be spouse and I are of two different worlds -- I've by nature been a churner, 800 credit score, stashing money for retirement, etc. She revealed to me that she is in a considerable amount of debt. $33k+ in CC debt, $150k in student loan debt. She makes around $42k/year.

I've never really had to deal with this, so I'm kind of piecing things together. Read through the FAQ and wiki, trying to figure out where to start. Here's the breakdown that I have from her:

Card debt:


Balance | Interest Rate
:--|:-- 
$5,150.44 | 25.24%
$5,242.01 | 22.99%
$4,939.69 | 18.24%
$1,628.26 | 25.24%
$5,095.33 | 25.15%
$3,269.57 | 29.23%
$2,455.48 | 27.24%
$5,072.94 | 27.49%

She is currently in grad school, graduating next year. This will lead to a bigger salary, defers a good chunk of her loans for the time being, and we're thinking of applying the excess student loans to paying off some of the CC debt. We've stopped all unnecessary spending and have a good rent situation in a major city. We've altered our wedding plans to something extremely minor that would require very little financially.

I understand the avalanche method and all that, but should we explore a card with a 0% interest intro deal and a no fee balance transfer? Should I help her explore bankruptcy as a possibility?",finance
personalfinance,New Auto purchase - Thin Credit,"I’m 19 and am looking to purchase a newer used car (2012-2016) in Summer 2020. This is because my current car that I’ve had for a year is deteriorating rapidly and I can probably get one more year out of it at best, or else the amount I spend to fix it could just be used on a new car. I currently have federal student loans in deferment and 2 credit cards that I always pay in full on time. My oldest credit card just turned a year old, so by the time I apply I’ll have 2 years of history under my belt. My question is, how likely is it I’ll get approved for an auto loan at a decent rate (3% and below) with 2 year credit history? My FICO 8 is currently 710 depending on utilization. Any co-signers are out of the question as my parents and grandparents credit is atrocious and I already have better credit than them. 

Current stats:

1 year credit history, ~710 FICO

2 credit cards (pay in full every month)

Fed student loans in deferment ($11,000 w/out interest by the time I apply) 

$8.1k gross income last year (will change this coming year, likely lower since I’m now an RA at my uni so less cash but free room/board), also getting $6k/year in lump sum from overdue child support and expect semesterly refunds starting next academic year (2020-2021)

personalfinance,Are used car prices non-negotiable anymore? Am I being played?,"(delete if not allowed, wasn't sure where else to put this)

Went to the dealer today looking at a used car for $10,000. Once we got to talking about price, I threw him an offer for $8200, thinking he would negotiate up from there, but instead he told me flat out that they don't negotiate for used cars. His rationale was that KBB, Edmunds, Cargurus et. al. allow for more transparency in the market and that they price according to what the market is showing. I thanked him for his time, told him to call me if the price changes at all, and walked out.

Is this true? Are used cars typically non-negotiable, or am I being fed a line of bs? FWIW, I'm waiting a few days to see if he'll call back.

Background: Indian, Age: 27. Not a citizen/permenant resident. Federal tax bracket: 24%. Currently investing in 401k and thinking to open a Roth IRA. Investments: 401k - VINIX60/VTIAX40. ROTH IRA WOULD BE: VTI60/VXUS40. I'll probably change the percentages but keep the funds and add bonds later stage.

Scenario: Considering that I will invest around 6-10% in my 401k and maxing out IRA every year till age 40 (investing monthly for approx. 15 years). If I have to leave US forever, what happens to my IRA or 401k?

Case 1: what would the growth for my IRA and 401k if I stop investing in these accounts after I leave the country. Consider that I'll keep all money I've contributed and gained in these accounts until retirement but I will not make any other monthly payments after leaving the country.

Case 2: For some reason, if I wanted to cash out all the money from either accounts, I've to pay taxes and penalty. Since I will not have any employment, my income would be zero, what would be my taxes then? And 10% penalty?

Case 3: I'll keep my 401k contributions and gains in the account and do not withdraw. What would be the best case for my ROTH? Opening a ROTH IRA or individual investing account? Since I'm not sure whether I'll leave the country or not and even if I leave I don't know if I will withdraw my money, let's assume that I've opened a ROTH IRA. How much more penalty will I be paying if I have to withdraw all of my Roth IRA in comparison with an individual investing account. 

Please advise.

personalfinance,Is It Worth Paying More Than Minimum On Student Loans?,"For some background, I am two years out of school, making $80k annually and living in a larger Midwest city. I had to buy a car after college because someone rear ended me and totaled it, so I have a $13,000 loan (3.39%) left on that (car was purchased brand new in 2018) . I have a motorcycle loan with $9k (5.2%) left (was purchased 2 months ago brand new), so basically $22k total debt. My student loan balance is about $23k. I paid extra on the one loan I had with a 6.8% rate, so all my loans together have about an average 3.5% interest rate. Based on my built excel sheet, paying extra on my bike, car, and student loans to have the car/bike paid off In 2021 and loans at the end of 2022 allows me to save 800-1000 a month after all expenses. Part goes to a wedding (planned end 2021) and a potential house (planned late 2022, but also depends on situation then). I also get paid bi-weekly, but budget my excel sheet for 2 checks a month, so twice per year I get an “extra check” that also goes directly into savings. My question is, I’m trying to balance paying extra on student loans and my 401k. I contribute 12% with a 6% company match, should I keep doing that and pay the same for loans? Should I just do company Match and put the extra to student loans? Or do I just pay minimum in the student loans and invest more?

This plan has a steady guaranteed cash value that never goes down plus dividends with a fixed compound interest rate of 5.3%  I added a disability rider just in case you become disabled.  Your premium never increases and the death benefit has a compounding element that is another important feature in addition to the cash value.  With traditional retirement accounts there is a 10% penalty if you want to withdraw money before you turn 59.  With this policy there is no penalty and you can use the cash value for your business or personal expenses before you turn 59.

Preliminary searching shows that this sub is NOT a fan of whole life generally. I should mention that my sister is early thirties, healthy, gainfully employed etc. This is being sold to her as preferable to a traditional retirement account.

investing,"Investing with a $25,000 (3% APR, 60-month) loan?","One of my friends asked me if they should take the USAA Career Starter loan. They are in the Navy's nuclear propulsion side of things, so they're locked in for 5-6 years until their contract expires, and I'm not sure if the Navy has ever forced nuclear personnel out for purely budgetary downsizing reasons.

Their situation:

- No debt of any kind other than credit card usage that is paid down every month
- Roth and TSP (federal version of 401k) maxed out every year since 2016 or 2017
- About $80K in taxable investment accounts
- 2 month emergency fund in high yield savings account, would bump it to 3-4 months from just the leftover money after all TSP deductions and expenses if he takes the loan just to be safe
- 5 years old car that's still doing fine
- Single and no GF

Their plan was to go for something like 50/50 mix of S&amp;P500 and US Treasury bonds.

Both of us are aware that the market could go tits up right after the funds are invested, but he believes the Treasuries will be a suitable hedge against that risk and in the worst case, he could sell the bonds to replenish the emergency fund if it's used up for something. And since he has guaranteed employment (as long as no drug/DUI or sexual harassment incidents occur), so if everything goes into the red, he can sit tight and keep making the monthly payment.",finance

personalfinance,[ADVICE] Pay out of pocket vs Student Loans?,"HELP.

Yes, I feel ignorant asking this, I imagine people would use cash if they could over student loans but maybe I'm missing something here and someone can enlighten me.

Finding myself in a unique situation where I might be able to escape the grips of student loans but wonder if I should have one anyway to build credit. 

I have enough money saved up right now to pay the first semester of my masters outright cash and my job offers enough tuition reimbursement to pay the full amount back. 

I'm wondering if I should just do a never ending cycle of cash and replenishing with tuition reimbursement for the remainder of the program (avoiding interest, fees and, what appears to be from this subreddit, alot heartache and nightmares) or have a student loan for the credit boost and diversity of types of credits.

A couple of details for context. The savings I would be using toward this would not level me of a savings, persay. I have a joint savings with my partner and this would deplete a separate personal savings entirely, but itll only be temporary. Credit score currently is in the 800s and my credit diversity only goes as far as credit cards and 1 auto loan. I have no idea if I could take out only a portion of one those unsubsidized federal loans since i dont need the full amount to fund my program. Tuition reimbursement is set up in a manner where I would get paid out after my grades have been released at the end of the term and would take some time to process. 

I've mirrored this post in r/studentloans to capture all seasoned folks in this tricky world of finance. Thank you all in advance for your guidance and advice, y'all are an inspiration, and I wish I can magically forgive all of your loans.",finance

personalfinance,Student Credit Card Options,"I am, as I'm sure you gathered from the title, a college student currently looking at credit card options. Building up credit history is especially appealing to me since I likely will require non-government loans at some point to finance my education, and hopefully some good credit history could improve the interest rates of the loans. I have heard good things about the Discover Student Cash Back card, and know someone who has had success getting the card with no credit history while under 21 (the same situation I am currently in).

However, I am planning to spend a semester abroad sometime during my next two years of school, and from everything I have seen, Discover is not accepted virtually anywhere overseas. Hence my dilemma. **Is it worth getting a (slightly) worse credit card now so that I can use it while traveling?** The one I specifically have been looking at is the Journey Student Credit Card from Capital One, but I don't know if someone my age (19) would be able to get that card without a co-signer.

Any advice would be appreciated, and any experience attempting to get the Capital One card in a similar situation would inform my situation.

I explictly choose **48 months term with bi-weekly** payment. Reason for choosing those numbers to keep the **Cost of Borrowing** meaningfully less!

Now I having doing part time with the car and I am ready to make infrequent  **Lump sum payments** which my lender allows. Right before doing my first lump sum payment **my friend told me it's not a good idea to overpay my loan** as it will hurt (*decrease*) my credit score. Following her advice I kept thinking and it made sense because a Loan is a liability for me but asset to the bank therefore maybe I am thinking it might hurt my credit score. To futher my understanding I read these two blogs:

1. [https://www.autoloansolutions.ca/blog/early-birds-win-why-you-should-pay-off-your-car-loan-faster/](https://www.autoloansolutions.ca/blog/early-birds-win-why-you-should-pay-off-your-car-loan-faster/)

My fiancé and I have had our house for 9 months. We plan to sell it in about 6 years or so when I change careers. 

I know the federal government just slashed loan rates down. Our current interest rate is 4.75%. 

I called my financial company. They offered I could get down to 4%, which would cut our mortgage payments down $200 a month. However this would be adding about $4,000 to the mortgage. 

Would it be worth it to do that now? Or a better idea to wait and see if the interest rates keep coming down? Not sure if the announcement today means they are effective immediately. Thanks!",finance

btc,Bitcoin Critic Peter Schiff Wins a Bet for a Gold Coin About Interest Rates - He Predicted Correctly 7 Months Into Future,"**TL;DR:** Schiff won a bet made January 20, 2019 about interest rates which were lowered today for the first time since 2008.

Video Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZFWL4FLic4

Many have seen the name Peter Schiff crop up around cryptocurrency forums, mostly related to his steadfast belief crypto can't work. People may wonder why he's important. The title is the reason. 

While most here would disagree with Peter Schiff on Bitcoin, many (like myself) completely agree with him on other things, like politics, economics, and central banks and their policies. What just happened today demonstrates, in impressive fashion, why people like Schiff (economic adviser to Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign) command respect.

**What Happened**

The U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on unprecedented monetary policy in response to the Great Recession of 2008, lowering interest rates and pumping money into the system to avert a further drop in economic activity. The head of the Fed at the time, Ben Bernanke, gave no indication he saw the collapse coming in contrast to people like Peter Schiff (and others like Mike Maloney) who warned a large economic problem was coming soon. In other words, Peter went against mainstream beliefs at the time.

Peter just won a bet today doing the same thing. Making [today's news](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/business/fed-rate-cut-july-meeting/index.html) is the announcement the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. It's significant for two reasons. First, it's the first time this has happened since 2008, over ten years ago! Second, as recently as the beginning of the year not only did nobody expect the Fed to cut rates in 2019, they expected the opposite, rate hikes and more than one hike. Peter's bet was the equivalent of betting on a horse given the worst odds in a race, but ending up winning.

Additionally, Peter gave his thoughts about gold prices. At that time in January gold was at about $1,280 per ounce. The panelist Peter bet against said he believed gold would go down in the coming months to around $1,000. Peter, however, said he thought that it was a slim likelihood gold would go back down to $1,000 and even slim it would go below $1,200. He was [right again](https://www.kitco.com/charts/popup/au0365nyb.html). Today gold is just over $1,400 per ounce.

Option C - Sunpower E20/327w panels x11 for 5,700 kWh at \~109% offset. System cost $14,700 w/ $4400 fed credit back, net cost $10,200 w/ monthly at $109 monthly, 3.99% APR.

Option D - Sunpower E20/327w panels x13 for 6,233 kWh at \~118% offset. System cost $13,800 w/ $4100 fed credit back, net cost $9,600 w/ monthly at $102 monthly, 3.99% APR.

Option E - Panasonic VBHN335SA17 Panels w/ Enphase IQ 7X Microinverter - Offset 115% usage. Total system price $13k with $3900k federal credit, net cost is $9k. Panels and inverter (Panasonic/Enphase) have 25 year warranty, 25 year system and production warranty.

I'm now debating these options and the extra cost of SunPower regarding whether its worth it or not. The SunPower dealers are saying Enphase and Panasonic have holes and weird fine print in their warranties T&amp;C that suggest they may not cover shipping with inverter replacement which can equate to multiple services calls over the years at roughly $250 a pop, and obviously more in the future. They've also mentioned a Panasonic lawsuit regarding premature panel failures with Sanyo panels installed over 10 years ago.
