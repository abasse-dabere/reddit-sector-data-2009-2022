personalfinance,Should I pay for a financial advisor?,"I'm 28 years old and I'm a recent professional school graduate who's earning more money now than I have before school, but I'm also \~$320,000 in debt which currently held by the fed on income-based repayment.

I'm not necessarily interested in throwing all of it at once to my loans because I'm interested in having some money saved in order to open an office and work for myself (as opposed to being an associate) within five years. I have about $40,000 in my savings+checking accounts and my money is just sitting there as I save most of my income.

I recently learned about financial advisors who work specifically with people in my field, and they charge $200 a month for people in my situation. They're also fiduciaries.

Right now, I made \~$8,000 this month working 3.5 days a week and will be earning a bit more in the future (I took a temporary pay cut due to the pandemic and am also planning on picking up more days) I'm also not paying rent because I'm living at my parent's place right now. I don't really have many expenses either. Most of my income right now is ending up in my savings account, and some of it is going toward my loans.

I'm interested in signing on with them so that I can develop the right investments and investment habits early. Additionally, I have reason to believe they'll assist me with that job transition when the time comes within that five-year time-frame.

I'm not interested in learning the ins and outs of trading on my own. I don't have any retirement accounts except for an anemic 401k that was started by an employer almost ten years ago that's no longer receiving any contribution. No one in my family knows very much about investing or anything so I figured I might as well pay for it now and expect it to pay off in the future because I acted while I was young.

Edit: I want to add that I'm a 1099 at all my places of employment.

Thanks for your time girls and guys",finance

personalfinance,Payoff car or use cash for down payment on investment property.,"Hey all I have 100k cash, a $800 mortgage, and a $600 car payment (5% interest 35k owed paying double monthly payments)  For dti sake I make 80,000/year and am trying to figure out whether paying off the car or using the full 100k for an investment property makes sense. Here's the way I see it:

Currently my dti is at 21% (800+600)/(80000/12)
Freddie Mac has a max 45% dti leaving me 24% of my income to work with.
(80000/12)*.24 = 1600 mortgage for investment property

Assuming a 4% interest rate max I can borrow is about 335k

100k down-payment would indicate a 435k property and a 23% down payment (100/435)

Assuming a modest 7% cap rate. I would be drawing in 30k/year in rent (2500/month)

Alternatively

Pay off car reducing dti to 12% leaving 33% of income available for mortgage 80000/12*.33 = 2200

In this case I could borrow up to 460k but only have 65k down for a 12% down payment (65/(460+65))  Not even sure if I can get a loan at that point.  However if possible and assuming 7% cap would bring in 36k/yr not much of a difference. 

If I decide to pay off car and keep down payment at 25% 
Would be a 260k mortgage 325k property and 22750/yr in rent.


I'm leaning towards keeping the car payment and using the full 100k cash for down payment. Wanted some outside thoughts though.",finance
gaming,How Minecraft (kind of) just taught my little brother a lesson in sustainability.,"I just had the pleasure of experiencing one of those uniquely brilliant younger sibling bonding moments with my little brother that was unexpectedly made possible by our shared love of gaming, or more specifically, Minecraft. I don’t want to waffle on so i will try and get straight into it but i didn’t know who else to share this story with and hopefully it’s allowed here as i feel you guys may appreciate.

So gaming as i see it is still relatively new, its something that we have all experienced growing up (i’m now 25) and in my own personal experience it has been the most effective medium in allowing me to truly bond with my significantly younger brother (8 years old), on a level that no other way of interacting with him has achieved. Because of our significant age gap and me already being away from home when he was born i’ve always struggled to bond with him on a common level as i have with my other siblings who are closer to my age. However, one thing that has bonded us like no other has been our passion for gaming, albeit we do tend to be at opposing ends of the spectrum regarding our most beloved games (think RPG heavy Skyrim-Esque for me VS Fortnite type games for him).

However, one game we do share love for is Minecraft. Now i myself played Minecraft early in it’s Alpha days when i was close to my brothers age and to see him enjoy it as a did as a child brings unrivalled joy to my heart. Now the story itself begins with me visiting home, which i don’t do as often as a should, but whenever i am home i always try to spend time with my brother and that usually involves playing Minecraft together. Playing together presents the perfect opportunity to have a real talk with him as usually he is a bit of a introvert and tends to be a shy kid, but when he’s concentrating on his video games (particularly Minecraft his favourite) you just see the shyness within him fall away and his true personality open up. 

So as we are playing i get to asking him about the usual things like how he is doing with friends and how school is going, and in the past he had mentioned that he was learning about the environment and things like global warming. Now i may not be giving him enough credit but truthfully, as an 8 year old kid, i feel as though he didn’t really understand anything he was talking about and was just kind of repeating important words he had heard about in school.

Now skip forward a few months to my visit home this week and this is where a small, but truly unique opportunity arose during one of our brotherly Minecraft sessions. So he’s still quite new to the game and he plays on his Switch and almost always plays in creative mode. I’d tried countless times to explain to him in simple terms the gratification and fulfilment that Survival mode gifts you by having to go out yourself and mine the materials you use to build your creations and bases, but until now he never really got it. 

Well this time when i called home i said we’ll start a new game on Survival mode that we can play when i visit. So as we begin i’m showing him the ropes, were chopping down trees lift right and centre and to be fair to the kid i hadn’t been giving him enough credit as he picked up the basics super quick. Now skip forward an hour or so and we’ve made our first mud/wood base to survive the terror that the first new nights bring (i’ll never get tired of the nostalgia the start of a new Survival game grants me) and my brother says he want’s to go and chop some more trees to make a better base. So i passed the controller over to him and let him venture out in search for more wood and saw a perfect opportunity to nip off and go and make myself a quick cuppa. 

However, on my return i was greeted with a some what agitated and sulky 8 year old who explained to me that he was getting fed up of having to walk further and further away to find trees and collect wood for our base. When i first got presented with what i saw as a minor inconvenience i didn’t think anything of it, yet when i took a second to think about what he had said i realised i only saw this as a minor issue because i already had the knowledge that we could grow trees ourselves right next to our base. But to an oblivious 8 year old kid who was use to instantly having access to whatever he needed in creative mode, it was understandably an infuriating situation and in that moment of realisation i decided to make this a lesson.

Rather than just showing him how to plant the numerous saplings he had unknowingly been collecting, i took the opportunity to explain to him the importance of why we must always do our very best to replace and replenish the things we take from nature. Now to anyone else this may not seem like a big thing but i truly believe as i was explaining to him the importance of sustainability, in simple terms, through a medium he was familiar and comfortable with, that he legitimately understood the message i was trying to get across and genuinely learned a powerful life lesson at such a young age. 

I apologise if this post was far too long and extremely long winded as like i said in the beginning i do tend to waffle on. But this seemingly small interaction and experience that i shared with my little brother was only made possible through the fact that gaming exists. We all know that in the mainstream media, and sometimes even in popular culture, gaming itself is shown in a negative light or is presented in a warped way that doesn’t authentically represent it. So i just wanted to share this small experience i had with you all as for me personally, it has had such a profound effect on not only the way i view the relationship with my younger brother as a strive to be a positive teacher and influence to him, but also on my view of gaming itself and the way in which we sometimes overlook or forget it’s importance in our lives not only as a utility for fun, but as a significant tool with the potential to positively mould our younger generations vision of the future.",technology

It already happened when Biden was Vice President. The IRS became a tool against political opponents. They expanded and forced a Healthcare system against people and issued fines against those who chose to not participate. Personal income and Corporate income Taxes will go up! With our rising debt, we cannot allow a Federal government that will tax its way out of the whole. Trump has lowered taxes and tax revenues have increased because of it. As the global financial markets transform due to technological innovations, the Us stock market has become the beacon of stability. A disastrous tax scheme by the Democrats will ruin this and shift financial power to China and elsewhere in the world.

One of the main risks to world peace is US and Russian nuclear conflict. Obama’s foreign policy was ruined by those in his administration obsessed with destroying Russia. Clinton would have amplified this and decreased stability in global affairs. Biden will return us to a period of conflict with Russia and to the erosion of American power abroad.",finance

investing,What is the actual implication of FED allowing inflation to rise above 2% for stock investors?,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/27/powell-announces-new-fed-approach-to-inflation-that-could-keep-rates-lower-for-longer.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/27/powell-announces-new-fed-approach-to-inflation-that-could-keep-rates-lower-for-longer.html)

*The Fed now “seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,” rather than 2% inflation as a fixed goal. What this means in practice is that:*

*“following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”*

When FED announced unlimited QE in mid-march, I didn't understand the implication of that and was still expecting for further market crash and reduced amount of my monthly investment. So would like to avoid the same mistake and analyze and discuss the implication of this major policy shift better.

Questions

1. Does this policy shift of allowing inflation higher than 2 % mean stocks are going to appreciate much more than expected before? Does this mean its prudent to invest now than wait for another corona related crash/Nov election crash?
2. What is the impact of this policy shift on other asset classes like bonds, metals etc compared to stocks?
3. If Biden wins, what are the chances that the new FED chairman appointed by his government reverse this strategy?",finance

personalfinance,Should you really always pay the higher interest loan first?,"Say you have two loans, L1 and L2. L1 has a principle of 100k and interest rate of 3%. L2 has a principle of 10k and interest rate of 10%. You have some amount of money, say 5k, that you want to pay towards your loans, or you have 1k per month extra income to allocate towards the loans.

All wisdom I've found says ""pay your higher rate loan first!"", i.e. spend the 5k or all the 1k/month on L2. But in this kind of situation, does that really make sense? Since the principle on L1 is so much higher than the principle on L2, it seems to me you want to focus on paying down L1 faster as you'll be paying so much more interest on it.",finance

She didn't have milk come out of her nose and I believe if she did inhale anything it was a very small amount and was likely expelled when she sneezed.I stopped feeding her and she seemed to be breathing fine but she was meowing and fussy for ~30 mins after that. She has seemed okay throughout the day and night. She is not meowing excessively and she is sleeping normally.

personalfinance,Avoid Loan Depot for your Mortgage,"My family has been working on a typical 30 year fixed mortgage with Loan Depot since July. We are still not clear to close and have been sitting in Conditional Approval for months. Underwriting asks for the same documents over and over again. Our loan officers (four of them, thus far) are obviously overwhelmed with a very busy time. The company is understaffed and unable to get us cleared to close. Vacations and holidays delay the process even more. We are about to deal with our 5th and 6th loan officers. They copy / paste computer generate underwriting lingo without translating it and leave us in the dark with no care or explanation. They never initiate contact with us, I am following up every week to be met with conditions that have already been provided that the loan officer couldn’t be bothered with checking their own portal for, where we have uploaded them. They don’t receive the faxes they request and don’t confirm this until weeks later. They ask for CPA letters that have to be redone because we supply them “too early”! It’s generally mind-fuckery and extremely poor communication. We are a number in their large and overwhelmed system. Please, for the sake of your family, go with any other company aside from Loan Depot for your mortgage. I cannot express my devastation enough for choosing them.

Update: this is a first time purchase, 30 year conventional that we locked at 2.875% in mid-late June.

UPDATE: still not CTC with 5 business day remaining until originally projected closing date. We have to be out of our current home 6 business days from today.

UPDATE: we were verbally cleared to close by one of our 6? or so representatives (the original one, located in CA) on Friday before the holiday. When I called to thank his counterpart (located in MA) a few hours later and provide “one last” contingency, he advised me that that was incorrect and we were back in UW. Between these calls, I advised my lawyer and the sellers we were CTC. It’s the weekend before now, a holiday weekend, and we are still not CTC. Loan Depot would like you to know these delays and mishaps are Freddie Mae’s fault and that this catastrophe has only happened because we are self employed... Since this delay has happened they have restructured our loan offering down 25K (that they originally signed off to on a disclosure already), and offered a lower interest rate of 2.75 to compensate. I have never been so upset as my family waits amongst our boxes over a holiday weekend, our last weekend to find a backup plan in case this all goes to shit. 
We have lost money in movers, sellers have apparently resigned from jobs, we have $65,000 tied up in escrow and somehow this is our fault because we are self employed and thus a hard loan to approve. They’re right, it is our fault for going with them.",finance

We are in the process of buying a home &amp; were very happy to hear our lender gave the option to lock in the rate with a float down option, which we agreed to. I know that we need to notify the lender that we want to exercise that option now that we have it, but I am not sure how I will actually know the rate is going down? Apparently it needs to go down a quarter of a percent for them to make the change. When I Google current mortgage rates, I see a standard rate on sites like NerdWallet have an average current rate, but that is higher than the rate we agreed to. Am I just looking for that average rate to go down by .25%? ( If it happens) I am also wondering if I only have the option to exercise this float down once or if I can do it multiple times for each quarter percentage drop?

personalfinance,Attorney - Should I begin saving for retirement given student loans,"Hi all, long time lurker here. Here’s my situation: I currently am 27 and make $200K (which breaks down to $10.5K/month take home) a year as a big law associate plus a bonus at the end of each year (though it’s tentative this year because of COVID). My biggest financial goal is to pay off my private student loans which total $110K. I currently have $52,000 in my savings. I generally put away $3,500-4,500 per month. 

At this rate, assuming I save about that per month, I’ll have enough to pay my private student loan off in one lump sum in just over a year, approximately October 2021. And by January 2022, I could have paid off my loans, begin saving for retirement, and have an emergency fund of six months expenses. 

However, I’m not currently saving for retirement, nor am I investing. My money is sitting in a Marcus savings account. My hesitation with investing it is the uncertainty COVID has caused. My hesitation with throwing $30K at my loans immediately was that I was anticipating a recession (which has since visited us through the pandemic) and wanted to make sure I had the money on-hand in case. I make too much for a Roth IRA, but I can do a 401(k). The only caveat is that my employer does not match. 

I could start putting away 5-10% of my checks away to a 401(K) immediately, which would push my timetable back to paying off my loans probably closer to December 2021/January 2022. I also have another $89K in federal loans which will be paid off on a longer scale. 

To spare the details, I could take a slower approach to paying the private student loans, but as long as I do that, I’m chained to a big law job, which comes with very long hours and incredible stress at times, most people leave within 2-5 years at the job. I am about to start my third year. I could still make six figures after this job, but it would be about $100K/year. So, what would you do in my position? Start saving something for retirement now? Would you use the 401(k)? Have I been making a mistake by not starting earlier (just under two years ago)? Thanks in advance for any insight!",finance

personalfinance,Managing Debt - Mainly Student Loans - Debt Aversion?,"Hello all,

As a result of some poor choices in schooling about 14 years ago, I amounted about $285k in student loan debt.  With that said, it's been 11 years and have not missed a payment on the consolidated federal loans ($245k-ish) and 4 private loans ($40k-ish).

I will never catch up to the federal loan chunk. The minimum payment to make progress on that loan is about $2300/month for the next 14 years, and most people barely even make enough money after taxes/mortgage/insurance/etc to pay that.  So I am content with staying on IBR and making the minimum payment until the forgiveness taxable event in 2035.

**Here's my question/dilemma....** Focused on the 4 private student loans with variable rates... Most people follow a debt aversion strategy and pay off their smallest loan first (which could be the lowest interest rate), get it off the books, and use that money to add on to the next debt. However, this is proven to lose you money in the long run. It creates miniature goals by providing a sense of accomplishment in paying off a smaller debt, while your higher interest loans keep accruing with high balances.  With variable loans, the highest interest debt seems to flop almost every other month with these loan companies.

For the last 3 years, my extra payments were going towards the highest interest of the 4, but with about $3k left, it has now flopped to the lowest.  What should I do? Pay it off? Switch immediately to a different higher interest loan and be content with the min payments there?

I think I may have answer my own question just typing this out, but mentally, you get so excited getting close to paying off your first loan, but it may not be the smartest financially.",finance
personalfinance,"Where is the best place to put money? Mortgage, student loans, or investing?","Background info:

I'm a 24 year old woman with a job in STEM my salary is $74k a year. I lucked out and got this job immediately after graduation. School left me with roughly $70k of student loans. $13k in federal loans at 3.5% interest and the rest in a scattered amount of private loans. I think I had four private loans with interest rates ranging from 5-9%. I spent the first year out of college trying to wrangle in my debt and now have all the private loans consolidated at 4.5%. In the two years since graduation I've got the private loans to $37k and the federal loan at $12k. For the most part we're just going to ignore the federal loan. The interest rate is low enough for me to find it unproblematic.

Right now I have $10k to use in one of the three options. 

(I have $5k as a constant emergency saving and $20k in my 401k but I'm not touching either)

Options:

Buy a house-
Mortgage rates are at a crazy low! Where I live there are a lot of programs to help a first time homeowner and I'd need barely any money for a downpayment. Overall a safe investment and on a personal note I've moved close to 7 times in the last six years. I miss having a place I look forward to returning to and I can call my own. Also where I am rent is pretty much equal to a mortgage. But this is probably one of the riskier and more expensive options.


Keep throwing money at student loans-
Typically I throw all my extra money at student loans, around $2k each month. At the current rate I could be debt free in two years!

Invest-
I have $4k in investments currently. It started as just money I'd feel okay losing. But in the past year and a half I've gained 60%! I dont know if putting money there makes more sense than student loans. It's considerably less dependable.

End note:

I just want to make sure my money is doing the best for me that it can!

In retirement I'll live off distributions from my various tax-deferred accounts (401k, etc.), which will be taxed at my new marginal rate (hopefully lower).

I made out a budget and at the moment can afford to contribute just about 10% to my (trad) 401K while maxing out my Roth IRA, though I might lower the 401K contributions a little so I'm not stretched as thin. Should I move some of that trad 401K contribution to the Roth 401k and if yes, what are the advantages of that? I'm assuming my company's matching will go into my tradition 401K so at the very least, I'll be putting 3% to get the matching.

Background: I make $70K and live in an HCOL area. I have an emergency fund \~$13K which is roughly 6 months of expenses and no major credit card debt (I pay off the full statement each month). The only major debt are my federal student loans which are \~$15K and I think interest is sitting around 4-6% though I am not sure since they been deferred because of COVID and currently have 0% interest listed. I planned on just doing minimum monthly payments on those (\~$162).",finance

personalfinance,Opinion: Invest the interest from your emergency fund to effectively increase your interest rate,"You're losing money in your emergency fund account due to even the best interest rates in high-yield savings not beating inflation in this enviroment. You can't move your emergency fund into higher return assets because that comes with loss risk or lack of liquidity.   

My opinion is that people who have the time should take their interest payments from their emergency fund, and invest them in high-risk high-reward stocks of ETF's with a broker who does fractional shares and zero commission trading.  Your principal is always safe (minus the regular loss due to inflation) and the worst thing you can do is effectively change your APY from 0.8% or whatever to 0%, while the upside could be a nice bonus in a good market.

I am seriously considering the idea of either trading in or selling my car. I want to cut my debt and think this is a good start. Here’s a rundown of everything. 

I bought a 2016 Nissan Maxima SR in February 2018. 
Price: 19,999 + 3,000 for extended warranty thru the dealer
Total purchase amount = $22,996
Down payment: $5,000
Original loan amount: $17,966
Current loan amount: $11,183
Interest rate: 3.79%
Monthly payment: $330

I have done a couple trade in and sell values and have been offered the follow range:
For trade-in: $15,500 - $17,600
Sell for cash: $14,500 - $15,500

I would get some money back from the extended warranty since I am able to cancel that and get refunded at a prorated value. 

Would it be worth doing this and getting a cheap car for about $5k, meaning no car payment?? and lower insurance.....

With interest rates dropping, we thought it would be a good opportunity to refinance and lower the mortgage (currently at 4.75) but the bank said that we can't add anyone to the mortgage without them on the title. The issue with adding us to the title, according to them, could be an unexpected tax liability because the house is halfway paid off, so the diluted equity in my mom's name would be seen as a 'gift'.

vet,No one can figure out what's wrong with my cat,"My cat is 10 years old, and was doing well so it's not old age. We got home from vacation the Saturday before last, and he was fine. Then Sunday he was extremely lethargic and wouldn't eat or drink on his own and peed himself while sleeping. Got blood, fecal, and urine tests done. I force fed him and made him drink on Monday. The test results were all normal besides the fact that his white blood cell count was extremely high. Tuesday he started improving and soon he was almost completely back to normal. Then Sunday he started getting a little worse again and by today he was almost as bad as before. He had a fever this time and we got more tests, and xrays. His white blood cell count is slightly high but in a normal range now. Neither the vet, nor radiologists see anything wrong with the xrays. The vet wanted to do a toxoplasmosis test but I don't think that's likely as none of our cats are ever allowed outside, nor are they prey reactive at all.

personalfinance,"Advice on my financial situation (21 year old... junior in college). CDs vs other forms of investment, etc.","&amp;#x200B;

Just some quick background on my financial situation. When i was young, my family won a lawsuit that awarded my sibling and i about $52,500 (current value) each that went directly to our college funds and have been in CDs ever since (about 11 years). I am a junior in college now and will likely graduate in spring of 2022 with no student debt.

I went to a local community college tuition free for three semesters, transferred to the college i am at now for my 4th semester. (Which ended up being much cheaper than expected due to COVID kicking us all out of the dorms)

So my first 4 semesters of college were all covered by other sources of money (savings, summer job, graduation money, etc.)

Now i am left with the full amount of money in my CDs with 4 semesters of school left.

My (major) expenses include

|Expense|Per Semester|Total (4 semesters)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tuition|6250|25000|
|Rent|3000|12000|
|Total|9250|37000|

So i expect to graduate with around 10,000 - 15,000 in the bank in May 2022 depending on if i move to a more expensive apartment for my 4th semester. (This isn't including any income i may earn if i pick up a few hours a week somewhere or work a summer job / internship)

I don't know the exact interest rate of my CDs. It is somewhere in between .64 - .80. I am aware that there are pros and cons to CDs. I know there is no risk with CDs, but with that comes the low interest rates.

Would there be a better way to grow this money that i won't need for my education so when i graduate in two years it is more than the expected amount of around 10,000-15,000? Or are the CDs my best option?",finance

Now, we are in a reverse situation. My wife’s credit isn’t bad but she has a couple things weighing her done. Mine is much better.

personalfinance,Buying a Home or Pay Off Student Loans?,"Hello Everyone,

My wife and I want to buy a house eventually but with rising home prices and low interest rates we feel pressure to act but at the same time are expecting new expenses in January and are hesitant about accruing additional debt and are considering using the money saved for a down payment on a house towards paying off student loan debt. 

So the dilemma is as follows - 

Debt:

$900/month for student loans

$1,100/month for daycare (just had a baby both wife and I will be back to work from leave in January

Income:

$7,500 take home between us

Expenses:

$4,300 (rent , insurance, utilities, fuel, food, etc.)

We wanted to gather thoughts on two options (or others if you have them).

Option 1: Fully paying off student loan debt at the end of the year with money saved (including emergency funds which would be a priority to refill) and using a low down payment (3.5%) mortgage to purchase a home to mitigate monthly debt payments to about $2000/month in home payments and $1100/month in daycare costs.

Option 2: Keep our savings for a larger down payment (10%), take on a conventional mortgage sometime next year with total payments on the house being somewhere close to $2000/month in addition to a $900/month student loan payment (payoff 2026), and $1100/month in daycare costs.",finance
stocks,Understanding the Market in a Pandemic World,"Hello Investors, today I am making a post on understanding the current state of the market. I have posted previously under the accounts [u/pleasantvibe](https://www.reddit.com/u/pleasantvibe/) and [u/stonksanalyst](https://www.reddit.com/u/stonksanalyst/) (yes this is my third account). These are confusing times, and even the elite experts can't fully make sense of *everything*. But, I'm not pretending to be omniscient, so let's get into it!

(TLDR is located at bottom of Post)

The biggest question I've seen asked is why has the market rebounded so quickly? The US GDP took a greater hit in Quarter 2 than the stock market crash of 1929. The single worst economic times in US history followed the 1929 crash, so WHY are we not seeing a hard hit stock market today? Two words, government assistance. The US government has spent **7 trillion dollars** in stimulus for the private sector. In case you haven't heard from anywhere else, that figure is astronomical. Many of you readers may have received this stimulus, whether it was in the form of a $1200 check, paycheck protection from the company you work for, or disaster relief for your business. That doesn't explain the whole story though. Putting money (mostly) in the hands of regular citizens and small business owners doesn't explain a stock price rebound for the world's Fortune 500 companies. Even with that money circulating back as spending, consumer spending is still down 1.2 trillion dollars from the first quarter of 2019. So what are the other reasons?

Another two words, Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has artificially lowered interest rates to what is effectively zero. Interest rates have been extremely low since 2009, but they were on a recovery track before this injection of capital into the economy. Low interest rates have a variety of different effects on the economy. Cheap loans, higher physical asset prices, and what I believe to be most important for this post, terrible fixed income prospects. Whether it be storing your money in banks, buying bonds or treasury notes, you **cannot even beat inflation** with any of these in the current times. Because of this people who are trying to create long term wealth have but one single option. The stock market. A total stock market index, which simply matches the return of the entire stock market, will out earn a 10-year treasury note three times over. This has brought investors pouring money into the market like a firehouse because there is simply no other option. With more buying of stocks, means higher stock prices because as you all know, as demand of something goes up, so does the price.

Another key thing to note is the accessibility of the market. In years before the internet where similar situations have occurred in the US and Global Markets, normal everyday folk couldn't simply just take their small earnings and stick them in the market. There were far more barriers to entry. Now with brokerage apps, fractional shares, and even no fee trading, anyone with a smart phone and one red cent to spare can be in the market. This adds as multiplier effect to the inflation of stock prices.

Finally, I have seen a trend of investors who believe that the government will continue to prop up the economy in times of disaster. While I think it is dangerous to assume such things, regardless, there is a level of confidence building that crashes that we've seen in the past may be just that. A thing of the past. This causes confidence to put your money (or leave your money) in the market even during bad economic times. This adds, yet again, another multiplier to stock prices.

TLDR: Government assistance and low interest rates have caused people looking for a return that will beat inflation to rush to the stock market. Since the stock market is easier to access than ever, this is why we see stock prices that don't reflect the state of the global economy.

Happy Investing,

investing,The bubble conversation.,"So I’m not blind to the conversation of a pending market crash. My only long is TSLA where my avg is now $200 after picking up a few share post split. My portfolio lives and dies by the hand of Tesla but in any case I have been doing well maintaining liquidity and taking small wins on small positions daily bringing $50-150 on each short. Ive been doing my best to avoid getting too attached to anything even if I sell for profit and it continues up. I do not chase unless it is early in a rally. My goal is to consolidate as much capital and splurge on blue chips in the event of a crash. Rather then take calls or hedge with GOLD. I’m rather new to investing like many others and I’ve poured a lot of my earnings into the market the past few months so for me a 40% drop on long holds would hurt me. My outlook is if professional investors are screaming crash I would rather bet on their anxiety being real rather then manipulation. My ROI this year is 62% while a lot of this accounts for the gains via TSLA I’ve made about $1500 via a short strategy. While I understand that I’m leaving a lot on the table I’m viewing this as a scalper taking a lot of small victories across a consistent period of time. 

While a conservative approach may be less lucrative  if the endless rally somehow continues I’m looking for a bit of affirmation or someone to play devils advocate. I’m still relatively new.

personalfinance,Coming back from financial slip ups,"Sorry this is my first time posting in this forum. This may be very long. I apologize if I break rules. I am a 23F. I have about $10000 in debt. I know it is manageable but I just don't know how. I was never taught proper financial literacy and my family leaves me to deal with it on my own.

I started my debt journey by taking out my first loan for college. I took out my first federal student loans and an additional small loan from Sallie Mae. One of my uncles signed as guarantor and he recommended I pay the interest while I go to school (this was a bad idea). I went to a pricey school, so each year my student loans and scholarships just barely covered tuition with room and board. A week before I graduated senior year of highschool, I was kicked out by my family and was left homeless. I was able to keep a handle on it by working year round and a friend's family let me stay for cheap rent with a mattress on the floor. I still had school with a room and board to keep a roof over my head 9 months out of the year. My decent into debt got worse as I got a credit card so I could get my books for class (a lot of my books were expensive e-books).

I was still able to manage it. I started working two jobs while going to school and pushed any available money into bills and any available time in trying to find a job that didn't pay minimum wage. I had a 100% payment for all my bills and I was able to keep up with my bills. It was going good when life crashed through. I started talking to my family again and they recommended that I buy this older car from a family friend that I knew when I was younger. I wasn't all enthusiastic but I beleived getting myself a car would allow me to travel to better job and provide for myself better. (Also my town had no public transportation and my school was over an hour away from said town) I took out an auto loan through a credit union, but unluckily the car didn't even last 1 month before it was irreparable.

I was S.O.L because I was still stuck with the loan but back with the crappy hours. This was my true decent into debt. I was just barely pushing back against it or making a dent. I found myself in a cycle. My jobs were super important. I had to work as much as I could to bring in enough money to stay afloat because I was drowning. I started to lose my housing and no matter what new skill I learned or new job I got to make more money, I was still stuck. One year in particular was really tough to get through. I went through a bunch of emotional trauma (as my family and my ex were making things really tough) and I kind of snapped mentally. During most of the summer, where I usually made the most money because my schedule was open, I was jobless.

During this time, I had acquired a load of credit card debt, as my savings depleted trying to keep paying my bills and schooling. All this while I was looking for a better job. This was my junior year of college. I could barely make it through the next year of schooling and kind of fizzled out of trying to stay in the proper headspace. My outside influences blamed this slump on me, calling me lazy and irresponsible because I was just trying to process all the debt I had gotten myself into. I was on auto pilot working and paying whatever little bit I could.

I still tried to work towards finding better paying jobs and acquiring new skills. I used the last of my good credit (I had 700-something) to lease a car. With my car, I got my EMT license and worked as much as I could. I still attempted school but work and stress kind of got to me. My depression from my trauma crept back in and I found myself working on auto pilot again with insomnia and obesity running rampant. Someone I knew got me connections to a good job in my field of study and I started working there. I tried twking care of myself and slowly work my way back out of debt, while paying for an apartment and car etc. But then life happened again, running me down. I lost the apartment and now spend most of my expenses trying to travel to work. 

I am trying not to let the funk back in, I'm trying to adopt a healthy life style and motivate myself. I have about 9 months to pay back down my debts again and boost my credit so I can buy out my leased car (i have passed the agreed upon mileage). But I don't know the best way to go about it without crashing again. My credit is pretty poor right now from slipping then losing the apartment, cost of moving etc. I'm getting pressure from my uncle, as he feels that my Sallie Mae loan should have been paid off my now, and the stress is really piling. I feel I need to consolidate all my debt and get a personal loan, especially to get that loan out of my uncles name, but I don't know what that will do to my credit or if I'll be approved. I don't know the best way to go about it or what I have to do to even get started. I feel so dumb getting myself into this situation. But again, any financial advice I try to get from family or friends just isn't working. 

TLDR; A bunch of bad financial decisions have caused me to fall into debt. I need to either consolidate all my debt or slowly pay off one bill at a time. I'm lost at which is the best method and I have 9 months to get myself into a good spot financially and credit wise.",finance

But now I'm comparing and other banks like VIO and marcus goldman sachs have interest rates at 0.90- 0.80%.. I still have some money in my BofA account (mainly as an emergency fund), should I just move the rest of my $$ into a VIO/Marcus account or just move everything to my HSBC account since interest rates fluctuate anyway and the VIO/Marcus accounts might drop their rates in the future?

personalfinance,Is there any reason to have an emergency fund when you have access to security backed loans/line of credit?,"I've heard my entire life the importance of having a 3-6 months emergency fund and while I agree that it's a good idea for most people, once you get access to security backed loans/line of credit, doesn't a traditional emergency fund (dedicated savings account with 3-6 months of expenses) become unnecessary and actually more detrimental due to opportunity cost?

For example, if you have over 10k in a taxable account at M1 finance, you get access to their M1 Borrow Feature which is basically just their version of a security backed loan/line of credit. You can borrow at the following rates:

- 2% (Federal Funds Rate + 2%): M1 Plus
- 3.5% (Federal Funds Rate + 3.5%): M1 Basic

As with all security backed loans/line of credits, payment is flexible. You can pay back whenever you want as long as you meet the margin threshold. 

Now, I know what most people are thinking...

""That's margin! You could get margin called and lose everything!""

To avoid that couldn't you just borrow a very conservative amount? 

For example, if you have a 10k portfolio and only borrow 20% (2k), with a margin maintenance threshold of 25%, your portfolio would have to drop 73.33% before you get margin called.

*Margin call formula: Account Value = (Margin loan)/(1 - Maintenance Margin %)

Yes, I understand that brokerages can change the margin threshold at any time but even still, couldn't you just borrow even more conservatively? Say 10-15%? 

If you borrow 10% with a 25% margin maintenance threshold, your entire portfolio would have to drop 86.66% before you get margin called. 

Even if the raise the maintenance threshold to 50%, you could still afford a 80% drop! Assuming you've diversified or just invested into an index, that is something that has historically never happened. Essentially eliminating any possibility of getting margin called. 

Another concern I can think of is that the interest is basically variable as it's tied to the federal funds rate. Even so, federal funds rate has been on the decline since the 80s and has stayed at 0 for nearly a decade after 2008. It seems very likely to be the same for the next several years as well. Even if it were to rise, I find it incredibly unlikely it will reach anywhere close to historical highs and probably just ~2%. 

Okay but let's say it does go up anyways. Has variable rate ever really mattered for a short term loan? In this instance were talking about using a security backed loan/line of credit as a replacement for an emergency fund. In other words, using it as a source of money to keep yourself going for 3-6 months. Even if interest rates go up, the time frame is so short that I think it's well worth relying given that you can now invest your entire emergency fund. I'm a firm believer in ""time in the market"" and I feel like by being fully invested, I won't lose out on all the opportunity cost of leaving my emergency fund in a bank account. 

For example, my monthly expenses are about $450. A traditional 6 month emergency fund for me would be $2700. With interest rates as low as they are now, I'm basically getting nothing, even in an online high yield savings account. Now instead if I were to invest my emergency fund, by the time I'm 65 (23 now), it would've grown to ~23.5k at a 7% return rate. That's a huge opportunity cost! 

Now I know my example was specifically using the rates from m1 finance and while their interest rates are competitive, even if you were to employ this strategy at another place with higher interest rates, I feel like it still stands as a suitable alternative to a traditional emergency (albeit not as effective).

Anyways, I personally don't see any downside to doing this but I'm very interested and open to hearing different perspectives!

Edit #1:

I recognize, just barely meeting the minimum requirements is not a good idea to completely abandon a traditional emergency fund. To clarify my question, if your portfolio significantly exceeds minimum requirements (10x or more), is it a worthwhile alternative to a traditional emergency fund?


Edit #2:

Another concern I've heard below is that brokerages and banks will be tighten credit lines during recessions. I don't think I agree with this though. Historically the fed decreased federal funds rates during recessions which allow banks and brokerages to still be as liquid as possible, aka preserving the credit line. While I believe that maybe credit lines might shrink a little bit, I still think my proposal has merit assuming you have a very large portfolio.",finance

stocks,Lessons from 2018,"I keep a daily journal and every work day includes sections on market, often including my own sentiments and predictions as of that day and the sentiments and predictions of other market leaders.  It's interesting to look back.

Anyway, I've been getting similar vibes as 2018.  Entering 2018, my goal was to boost certain taxable positions during Q1-Q3 and then spend Q4 trying to top tick sell them for tax reasons.

2018 was playing out as expected, as least for my portfolio.  All the news flow was about peak earnings and how there was really nothing on the horizon that seemed like it could slow the ever growing success of certain big companies and sectors. 

Then along came October.  It started one day with an unexpected air pocket drop.  No worries, it's a blip.  But then the next day drops, and again.  Ok, normally one might think of buying the dip, but my goal was to do some selling, not buying.

Worse, the daily falls had no real consensus explanation.  Election?  Not really.  Earnings too good?  What?  Fed normalizing too fast?  Trump saying dumb stuff?  No set of causes was really all that convincing.   The drops became relentless, hitting my portfolio just about every single trading day, and disproportionately worse than indexes.  Pundits were blaming algorithms.  

By this point, all gains for the year, for everyone, were wiped out.  Trillions slashed from the markets.  

Now it's November, and I couldn't sell.  I needed some recovery, because my whole intent was to take some taxable gains, gains which had now vaporized.  

The ugliness continued into November, still without real explanation.  Election didn't really do it, and Trump's suicidal strategy with China wasn't the full cause either.  Tech stocks were losing 5% one day or 10% in a week.  Buying opportunity?  Or falling knife?  All I knew is that selling some ATH's was now a broken dream.  And I had to reformulate my strategy.

December was choppy, but Christmas week brought a downright crash.  My non-business journaling reflected the pessimism I felt losing months of progress in a couple days, and a year of hard won gains getting demolished in weeks.  

The main lesson here is that in October-December 2018, trillions of dollars in hot name stocks (stocks which were not even remotely overvalued compared to today) simply got chopped off at the knees relentlessly and steadily, with no real catalyzing event and no obvious explanation at the time.  There was no hiding from the damage.

The epilogue is that right at that Christmas 2018 crash I did load into some positions, and right after Christmas there was a glorious bounce that carried on for months,  

But what I'm taking from it is that we could absolutely see all these tech and cloud and software and EV levitators get mowed down (maybe even soon) and even if there's no one coherent reason or trigger.

personalfinance,Should I borrow from my 401k to eliminate my debt and boost my savings?,"Long time lurker here but I have kind of a convuluted question:

I have about 9 grand in debt that’s split between high interest credit cards, medical bills and reduced APR purchases. So far, I don’t have any issues with making the payments but it is really preventing me from actually saving money to grow my emergency fund.


My 401k, as most of us probably experienced, dipped significantly when the pandemic hit... however I have since recouped my losses and actually gained quite a bit within the last quarter... enough to actually “skim” that gain and completely eliminate my debt. 

Hey I did the math, if I borrow against my 401 I basically go back to my original balance from the start of the year but in return I end gaining more than $1000 bucks that I can build my emergency fund on (900 because of 401k loan). The question is, is it a good idea? The market has been astonishingly hot right now and it seems dumb to pull money from it but with the pandemic not really getting any better in the US and the huge disconnect with market performance and the actual economy, plus wondering how long the feds are going to prop it up makes me question whether or not to use my gains now to get ahead on debt or just let it ride.",finance

The IRA savings was about $4k that has maybe $6 in gains due to the poor interest rates. I processed a trustee to trustee transfer of that to my Fidelity IRA so now my IRA account has about $10k.

I am ready to do my Roth conversion of that $10k. Between the $6k cash contribution and $4k from my IRA savings I estimate around $7 in gains. All of my IRA contributions are non-deductible due to income thresholds.

When I do this $10k conversion would I have to add that on top of my 2020 taxable income? My guess is no and my only taxes owed will be on that $7 in gains but want to be sure.",finance

personalfinance,Paying off a loan with money from a separate loan,"To make a long story short, I have a private loan from my undergraduate education that I have around $2,000 left to pay off. I am in my masters program currently and have received my financial aid, the aid is in excess to what I will need for the semester (taking into account rent, groceries, emergencies, etc.) what is the best option 

A. Pay off the remainder of my private loan (9.6% interest rate) 

B. Keep the excess of my federal loan and readjust accordingly next semester so to not receive any excess.

My initial thought is to pay off the private loan as it is accruing interest currently while I while have a six month grace period before my federal loans from my current program begin payment phase. Any thoughts or insight regarding the situation? I only ask because paying off a loan with another loan sounds redundant and nonsensical",finance

Notes: 

* Taxes include federal, state (NY) and property tax (~$3k)

* 2005 was a partial income year. I graduated in May and started working immediately.

* 2020 data is extrapolated / estimated

* The charts are the result of mining my financial and tax records to put the story together. I hadn’t been monitoring my NW until last year.



2005: Graduated college - I only had about $40k in school loans when I graduated in 2005. People graduating today won’t have it quite as easy since tuition doubled (at my school; others have more than doubled). But you can still do some of the things I did to minimize expenses. First, go to a community college for the first two year and then transfer to university after that. This essentially cut my tuition in at least half. Plus, I lived with my parents in those two year and saved on room and board. Also, when I went away to university, I lived off campus in an apartment with friends. This ended up being cheaper and more fun.


2006: Purchased home for $61k – It’s a modest home in a LCOL area. This was a tough decision at the time because I could have afforded much more. But I am glad I didn’t make myself house poor. The house had everything I needed, and I enjoyed doing affordable upgrades.

In the years to follow, I would contribute to 401K up to my company match, max out Roth IRA and the rest would go to debt. A financially savvy person wouldn’t have paid off my mortgage so quickly. But given the crappy stock market performance in those years, and relatively small loan, I am not sure it made much difference.


2011: Mortgage was paid off

For the next 8 years I was on auto pilot. I was single and spent a lot of time working. Didn’t increase my spending much at all and my increases in salary went to savings. 

I still enjoyed life, traveled whenever the opportunity came up, and did little things like having my shirts dry-cleaned (because I hate ironing).  But otherwise didn’t spend a lot of money on material things. 


2019: I found this sub and started looking at my finances closer. Before this, I hadn’t every added everything up to determine my net worth. I knew I was in a good spot, but was pleasantly surprised to see my net worth over $800k at that point, then watched it cross $1M at the end of 2019 (when I included my home equity). The really great thing though, was when the market tanked after covid, I was knowledgeable enough that it didn’t faze me at all. I knew the market would go back up and it did. 


A few changes I made after becoming more financially educated:

* Set a FI goal and started a spreadsheet to track progress

* Changed my Roth 401k contributions to Traditional (should have done this years ago)

* Started mega backdoor Roth IRA contributions

* Put the $100k from my High Yield Savings (HYS) into the market 



That’s about all I have to say.

personalfinance,Refinance Advice - Is this math correct?,"Looking to refinance on my current house in Texas.  I plan on staying in the home for another 7-10 years, and may end up renting it out in the future instead of selling.

Current loan details:

|Term|360 Months|
|:-|:-|
|Original loan amount|$330,000|
|Remaining Balance|$313,500|
|Interest Rate|3.5% (paid for 1.629% points at the time)|

&amp;#x200B;

Refinance Offer:

|Term|360 Months|
|:-|:-|
|Loan Amount|$313,500|
|Interest Rate|2.5% (1.095% points)|
|Cash To Closing|$6000 (excluding pre-paids, \~$4000 lender fees, \~$2000 title fees)|

The monthly savings on the mortgage comes out to $240 less.  So to calculate the breakeven on the refinance, I think I take the cost of the loan divided by the monthly savings:

6000 x 240 = 25 months

However I was thinking I also needed to factor in the point cost from the original loan.  I believe I have 3 years on that original point cost left to break even.  So would I just add that on top of the 25 months, meaning the breakeven would be 61 months?  Is this even a deal worth pursuing?

The Trump administration extended the 0% student loan interest rate and suspended payments on federal student loans until Dec. 31st.  I had already set aside a significant chunk of money given that I expected to start paying down my loans in November (I just graduated this past May).  

My knee-jerk reaction is to put the chunk of money I had saved towards my loan and start bringing down my balance (I have enough to where I could pay a little under half of the loan off).  I had a conversation with my Dad about this and he thinks I should just hold the money since I don't know what's going to happen with COVID and for some reason, he has this idea that student loans from the class of 2020 will get forgiven, something that I feel is utopic at best.

I'm also tempted to spend the money on a down-payment on an apartment  (I live at home) or just hold it in my savings.  What should I do? Take advantage of the grace period or just operate as usual and start paying down my balance?

personalfinance,Lender offering low interest (1.58%) 5 year fixed mortgage on high ratio loans only. Whats the catch?,"Hi All,

There is a lender in canada offering 1.58 percent fixed mortgages on high ratio loans. So under 20% down payment. 

The big banks are offering 2.4% (advertised rate online im sure i could get a bit lower) for loans with 20% down.

I know a high ratio mortgage comes with mortgage insurance (on $650,000 purchase price and  5% down the insurance is only $18,000), but over the 5 year term, 1.58 percent vs 2.3-2.4% would leave me saving more money than what im paying for the insurance, as well as leave me more liquid (more cash for other investments with reduced DP).

Is this lender hoping i default? Are they hoping at the end of the 5 year fixed interest rates go up siginifcantly and im stuck with a huge mortgage? 

Edit: in canada fixed mortgages are fixed for 5 years than renewed, it is called a five year fixed.

personalfinance,Work on student loan payoff or collections debt payoff?,"Dumb question but I figured this was the best place to ask and get some varied advice.

Background: I am a dumb ass with money and was engaged to an abusive jerk at the time a lot of this debt happened. I have a lot of debt, about half is medical now, 40% credit cards and then 10% an eviction.

Right now I am paying $100 a month to one of the credit cards and $306 to a debt management program (DMP) that has all my other active debt. I am paying nothing on my federal student loans right now as I am enrolled.

Detailed info:

DMP: $8,190, paying $306 a month. $276 pays to debts, $30 fee for using the service. Estimated pay off: March 2023. Edited to add: none of this is gaining interest anymore. 

Loans: $8700 total, $6715 subsidized and $1985 unsubsidized. I have no idea the interest rate on the unsubsidized or what the subsidized will be when I go back into repayment, but I think in the 4.5% range.

So I mentioned I was paying $100 a month on a credit card. This is my last month paying that. If I put it towards the DMP (from 306 to 406), my pay off date becomes around December 2021, and then I could start throwing the full 400 towards student debt. If I start the student debt now, I can try to work that unsubsidized or the subsidized down significantly.

What would you throw this $100 at? Half and half? All to one? Put into savings? If student, unsubsidized or subsidized? (Edit 2 - I do have 600-700 a month going into savings already from a second job)

Up until now, this decision was left up to state and local governments. To make things sweeter, they also own Evidence.com, a cloud-based digital evidence platform. I expect that this will be a service widely utilized by law enforcement across the country, especially with the increased scrutiny that these departments are under given the state of police-civilian relations in the US.

personalfinance,Best strategy for aggressively tackling 10K of credit card debt ASAP,"&amp;#x200B;

Several years ago, there were some family health and immigration issues that resulted in me needing to fly a lot (usually internationally) and cover the cost of certain things because I was in the best position to do so. I didn't make very much money at the time but had great credit and high enough limits. But I also lived in a really expensive city and couldn't save much. I already had grad school plans so I ended up putting rigorous debt repayment on the backburner (just kept up with minimums and put any extra towards it) while I was in school. **I was 13K in cc debt a little less than a year ago when I finished.**

Now, almost a year after school, I have a stable job, make more money, and live in a substantially less expensive city. I don't have student loan payments. After a few months of getting my life in order, I paid the smallest balance, leaving me with \~**10K of cc debt today.** It's split pretty evenly on two cards, both of which have 18% interest rates. (I also made myself a rainy day fund, have the beginnings of solid retirement savings between my pre-grad school job and this one.)

I haven't used a credit card for a purchase in over 4 years, but that year or so of turmoil continues to haunt me! My relatively high cc utilization (78%) really lowers my credit score (**685** \- **700**). I also really need to buy a (very modest used) car, but don't love the interest rates available to me with my current credit score. I've saved enough for a down payment for a car in my budget (throwing that at the debt wouldn't decrease it enough to really help).

**Things I'm considering:**

1. **Balance transfer:** I think I'd get rejected? My score seems to be on the edge for getting a 0% interest card but interested in feedback.
2. **Personal loan from my local credit union:** I could get a 5K or 10K loan at 10.5% interest with my current credit score (8% if my score was 720). I could consolidate all the debt with the larger loan. But, with the smaller loan, I am curious if people think it would result in enough of a credit score bump that I could transfer the balance of the other card to a 0% interest card so I can pay that down quickly?
3. **Request higher cc limits**: They were set before I had my current job. I am mindful of the ding for the hard inquiry because I know more hard inquiries may come when I'm car shopping. Still, if it was enough to increase my score, it seems like options 1 and 2 could open up.

Anyone have any feedback on how best to attack this situation? I'm most interested in a) most strategic payoff strategy (a combo of the above? something else?) and b) how to time this all out to keep my credit score in a decent place.

I'm finally in a place where I can prioritize getting rid of this debt so I would be grateful for any wisdom or criticism if I'm thinking about this all wrong.",finance

personalfinance,What am I not seeing about the value of bonds in my retirement portfolio?,"I'm 35, and I'm starting to question the asset allocation in my retirement accounts.  The bulk of my money is in an American Funds target date fund; I'm going to move this into index funds to reduce the expense ratio, and while I'm at it I'm thinking about getting rid of the 16% allocation into bonds.  My reasoning:

\- When the account lost 35% in March my reaction was to buy more stocks in my brokerage account using what was supposed to be my vacation fund, so I'm apparently not prone to panic selling.

\- Any gains I achieve in the bond market are going to be erased whenever interest rates go back up, why hold them in a long-term account?

\- Historically stocks beat bonds in 90% of all 20 year periods and 99% of all 30 year periods

But the thing is almost every target date fund and professional retirement savings guide I've seen has at least some bond allocation, even for investments with a 30 year time horizon.  So I feel like I must be missing something.  What is the thinking here?",finance

personalfinance,High Yield Savings/Credit card/Roth IRA. 25 y.o Applying to medical school + starting a new job,"Hello, it's my first time posting here so please let me know if I need to delete anything in any way. 

I'm currently in the process of applying to medical school as well as about to start a new job, which I think is paying slightly above minimum wage where I live (\~$15/hr). I have 9K in savings, but I have to set aside another 2\~3K for a 2nd round of medical school application and have 2K in Rollover IRA from my previous job. I recently finished a post-baccalaureate program and have 13K in student debt where the interest rate is currently at 0% due to COVID19. I currently have BofA savings acct and credit acct and thankfully my credit score is good because I have no debt from undergraduate years. I'm kind of unhappy with BofA, however. I've been searching and the general consensus seems to be that the only merit is the ease of accessibility to ATMs around the country. 

The thing is, I'm not sure if I will matriculate into a medical school this cycle so I'm trying to plan out what to do for the next year or two depending on how it will go. I'm prioritizing paying off the student loan first, which I know for sure will be done by next year summer since my expenses are very minimal (under \~$500 a month). And iirc it's better to pay off the loan asap using what's left in the savings rather than just waiting so I have about 3K to spare. 

I was hoping to gain some insights on playing around the idea that student loan interest rates are zero until 2020 is over. Would it be wise to open a high yield savings account/credit card with a different bank? How about opening a Roth IRA while I'm employed? Or should I just hold off on everything until all my student debt is gone for sure? What would you recommend to someone who isn't (hopefully) going to be employed for too long, let's say no more than one or two years, because of future plans for education?

I apologize in advance for throwing a bunch of questions. Any tips/advice are greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Replacing windows before or after refinancing mortgage?,"We are planning on refinancing our mortgage to take advantage of the low interest rates and to get rid of PMI. It had always been our goal to replace the windows, which will probably cost about $11k. We were planning on using the equity from the house after the refi to purchase the windows. 
On the other hand, if we get new windows before the refi, it will up the value of our home (and I’m assuming more equity). The thing is, we don’t have the cash and would have to finance.  
Shower thoughts included the option to finance the windows now, go through the refi, then once we have the cash, pay off the window loan all at once. Maybe also look for a loan with no interest in the first few months? Any restrictions on getting a loan and paying it off within a short time period? 

There may be other things to consider or things I’m missing. I understand it’s a big picture way of looking at it, but any insight would be helpful!",finance
personalfinance,"Buying a home soon, is Bank Of America Preferred Rewards Program worth it.","Was wondering if someone could help me understand if enrolling in the BOA Preferred Rewards Program is worth it if I am planning on buying a home soon.

If I enroll, I would be eligible for the Platinum Tier (50k-100k). I have a trading account with another broker, and I could transfer those funds into a new Merrill Lynch Account. I know it’s not the greatest brokerage but would solely be doing it for he Rewards Program.

There are 2 benefits I am looking at. 

1.) The first one being the $400 reduction in the origination fee for a new purchase on a home. My plan was to first shop around at different banks to see if I could get the lowest closing/doc fees. When I was doing my research people were saying you could shop around at different banks to try to undercut each other to make the sale. I was going to do this and then take the lowest offer I could find and bring it to BOA and then reap the benefits of the rewards program.

2.) The second one being the interest discount on a home equity loan.  Currently the discount for Platinum is 0.250%. I can’t find anything wrong with this unless they offer me a ridiculously high interest rate and then discount it 0.250%. But assuming they offer me the average housing market rate then it would benefit me in the long run right?

Any help is appreciated! Thank You!

personalfinance,Finance Advice Needed for Parent's Retirement Plan,"Hello All,

I hope everyone is well.

I recently became somewhat financially literate, still currently learning. Looking for some advice regarding best options to maximize my parent's retirement account/and or alternative investments. They have a small business with traditional IRAs. They do ok financially and did not understand or invest much into retirement. This is concerning as my mother is 54 and father is 59. It appears that the majority of investments have gone into an IRA CD account around 50,000 each per person totaling 100,000. These are what my parents have been funding 7,000 max allowed per year, just starting several years ago. They have another two separate CDs separate from the IRA accounts around 50,000 per person, 100,000 total. So they have a total of 100k in IRA CD, and another 100k in regular?CDs. The majority of them are nearing the maturity date and are held within banks. The interest rate is 0.80% for the IRA CD accounts and around 1.3% for the first regular CD and 0.15% for the second CD. They are looking to retire about 5 years, maybe a couple more.  Feel free to educate me as much as possible.

**Questions:**

1. What is the difference between an IRA CD and a IRA that has CD with other investments?
2. Most of the investment resources I have found regarding retirement focuses on Stocks, mutual funds, index funds, and bonds within an IRA. Are the returns of CDs competitive compared to a ""very conservative"" portfolio with stocks, funds and bonds that is fitting for near retirement individuals?
3. Do my parents have substantial gain by stopping the 7k IRA CD investments and instead open another IRA account like with vanguard where they can freely invest that money into a standard portfolio until retirement
4. I have read about ""rolling over"" IRA accounts and was looking to potentially do this with the IRA CD accounts. I assume once the IRA CD matures, the funds can be directly rolled over to another IRA, no taxes witheld or the funds can be distributed to my parents then reinvested in an another IRA within 60 days, tax witheld. Is this correctly applicable to the IRA CD?
5. Regarding the regular CDs, would it be more beneficial to reinvest these funds into a brokerage account with stocks and mutual funds? I would like to think they would get some form of passive income.
6. Any alternative investing advice for their retirement time-frame or in general?

defi,Understanding the use cases for a collateral debt in DeFi,"Here's what i came up with so far: 

## Assumptions:
 
- You are long on BTC 
- Your bank (that would offer a more competitive interest rate) does not accept BTC as a collateral
- You bought way back 10 BTC for 400€ = 2.000€
- You'd like to buy a car for 38k€

## Option A:

- You sell 5 Bitcoin at a price of 10k€/BTC
- You pay Capial Gains of 25% for the gain of 48.000 = 12k
- You get 38k cash to buy the car

After 5 years value of your assets is 64k:

|Asset|Value                     
|:-----------|------------:|
|5 BTC|                      50 k|
|Residual value of the car|    14 k  |
|Total|    64 k  |


## Option B:

- You get a collateral backed loan of 36k, payable after 5 years. You pay 5% interest/year 
- Year 1: 1.8 k -&gt; 1.8 k
- Year 2: 1.8 k -&gt; 3.6 k 
- ...
- Year 5: ... -&gt; 9k

Scenario 1: BTC still at 10k€/BTC after 5 years  

|Asset|Value                     
|:-----------|------------:|
|10 BTC					   		|100k|
|Residual value of the car:     |14 k|
|- Debt repaying the loan:   |36 k |
|- Costs for interests:        |9 k |
|Total:|69 k|

Scenario 2: BTC is at 15k€/BTC after 5 years - You will own 119 k

|Asset|Value                     
|:-----------|------------:|
|10 BTC					   		|150k|
|Residual value of the car:     |14 k|
|- Debt repaying the loan:   |36 k |
|- Costs for interests:        |9 k |
|Total:|119 k|


So the primary decision driver is your position towards the future price of collateral used.
Right thereafter you look at things like ""time preference"", ""postponing capital gains"", etc.   

Did I miss some thing? Is there anything else that should be considered in the equation (besides the obvious, e.g. inflation rate, maintaining liquidity, risks ?",cryptocurrency

## Why did I title my milestone collection ""AudioVisual Bitcoin Art""?

I will set the tone for my explanation here, with Merriam Webster's definition of ""audiovisual"": [Definition of Audiovisual](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/audiovisual)[**:**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/audiovisual) designed to aid in learning or teaching by making use of both hearing and sight.

Since embarking on this mission to educate the masses about bitcoin using visual art, I have contemplated long and hard about how best to impact people with combinations of images and words.

I've studied the words and practices of experts in social psychology and propaganda from the likes of Gustave Le Bon, Edward Bernays, Friedrich Nietzsche, and others.

The voice of Gustave Le Bon, particularly seems to always ring in my head as I take particular creative decisions, at times when questioning whether or not a certain image may resonate with ""the crowd""

 *""The imagination of the crowds … is impressed above all by images. … It is possible to evoke them through the* *judicious* *use of* ***words*** *and* ***formulas***\*.""\*

*So here is my formula:*

**3 pieces of art** using the same structure, each with their own narrative, to propagate the base idea ""bitcoin is better money"" with different groups of people: 1) The fundamental/economically focused, 2) The risk averse/wealthy, and 3) individuals who highly value freedom.

**4 key points** for each of those narratives, animated with full audio tracks to create a more immersive viewing experience.

**Repetition and Reinforcement** of the over-arching phrases and easy-to-understand aspects of the entire message for each.

All 3 pieces will also be released on collector's edition prints via [www.luchopoletti.com](https://www.luchopoletti.com).

Each print will offer the audiovisual experience of the animation in an augmented reality layer via the artivive app.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,What type of loan to apply for if I want to build an addition on my house?,"I bought a house a few years ago for $270,000.  I want to build an addition onto the house but I am
looking for some insight as the best way to approach this.

I currently owe $240,000 - so about 30K in equity.

We got an estimate from a contractor and for the work we are looking to have done, it will cost about 80K.

I am not the most knowledgable when it comes to this so any feedback is appreciated.  What is my best approach here?

 - Can I just refinance at a lower interest rate for a $320,000 loan, pay off the old mortgage and use the excess to pay for the addition?  

 - I had someone suggest a HELOC but when I looked into it briefly, it seems I can only borrow based on what my equity is so I wouldnt be paying off the old
mortgage.  I would essentislly have the same mortgage loan, in addition to the HELOC, correct?

Ideally I would like to just pay off the old loan and start over with a higher amount and lower interest rate.

Bitcoin,For all the people selling their BTC and investing in DeFi...,"I just want to say what an enormous risk you are taking.

It's almost fall 2020, BTC is almost 12 years old, and institutional investors are only beginning to **dip their toes** into BTC. And just their little toes.

The last 4 years have seen significant financial infrastructure built around BTC such as Bakkt, CME futures and other futures markets, plus institutional funds with firms such as fidelity investments, and even after all that, investors from traditional finance are only beginning to **think about** the possibility of allocating a small % of capitol into BTC.

Do you seriously think these massive traditional finance players who are worth billions .... care about DeFi?

DeFi is so off the radar of these people, most have probably never hear of it, and if you explained it to them they'd probably laugh and say ""sounds like a nice toy"".

If you're in the crypto bubble, and are listening to the rantings of V. Buterin, and other blue-checkmark figure heads from the space, it's easy to get sucked in by the propaganda and really believe that DeFi will change the world - and it might - but don't hold your breath. The fact is DeFi is built on a blockchain (Ethereum) which has an enormous mountain to climb in terms of scaling beyond 15 TPS, and the entire DeFi space is built on this blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain size is ballooning out of control and soon will be out of the reach of the average hobbyist.

BTC on the other hand is built with incredible care and precision and nothing is rushed. Its blockchain and codebase are rock solid because the bitcoin ethos is quite the opposite of Ethereum's: Move slow and mend things. It's this attitude that has won BTC the attention of institutional investors and is the reason why they are beginning to consider looking at it as part of their portfolios.

I may be wrong, but I think Ethereum is a long way off being seen as anything but a toy by these big institutional players - especially for all the promises it makes - such as being the ""world computer"", when it's clearly not. 

Buzzwords are great, but high net-worth investors who know what the fuck they're doing do not invest in buzzwords. They perform rigorous analyses of the performance of the asset, the underlying algorithms, monetary policy, people, developers, and scour the entire ecosystem for any signs of inconsistencies or weaknesses. They do not invest in complex things that they do not understand.

So the BTC price has taken a bit of a tumble in the last day - I urge you to **stand firm** and do not sell your precious BTC because you heard some random YouTuber say that DeFi is the future.

stocks,Are we in a COVID/tech bubble? Here’s how to tell (+ my thoughts),"We might be in a bubble. We’re not at the later stages yet, but we’re getting there. Here’s a quick refresh on the 5 stages of a bubble and where I think we are in the stages.

**1. Displacement**

**A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a new paradigm, such as an innovative new technology or interest rates that are historically low. A classic example of displacement is the decline in the federal funds rate from 6.5% in July 2000, to 1.2% in June 2003. Over this three-year period, the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell by 2.5 percentage points to a historic low of 5.23%, sowing the seeds for the subsequent housing bubble.**

In our case the displacement is the Coronavirus pandemic. It has completely shifted how we think about--and value--technology stocks. Everyone is talking about the “post COVID world” and how that has upended tech companies.

**2. Boom**

**Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain momentum as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.**

We’ve already seen record numbers of retail investors joining the ranks. Everyone is stuck at home with nothing else to do and a bit of extra money from the stimulus, so they are deciding to learn how to ~~gamble~~ invest.

**3. Euphoria**

**During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and metrics are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the ""greater fool"" theory—the idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more—plays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.﻿ Similarly, at the height of the internet bubble in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the Nasdaq was higher than the GDP of most nations.**

IMO, we’re in the early to mid stages of euphoria. Asset prices aren’t skyrocketing, but they’re increasing rapidly. It’s not insane yet, but we’re getting there. 

**4. Profit-Taking**

**In this phase, the smart money—heeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point—starts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist John Maynard Keynes put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."" In August 2007, for example, French bank BNP Paribas halted withdrawals from three investment funds with substantial exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages because it could not value their holdings.**

﻿ **While this development initially rattled financial markets, it was brushed aside over the next couple months, as global equity markets reached new highs. In retrospect, Paribas had the right idea, and this relatively minor event was indeed a warning sign of the turbulent times to come.**

This could be us if we’re smart about it. Now, obviously we can’t time the market perfectly. But we can play the odds and start hedging our bets when we get to a point where it seems likely that we’re in a bubble. In the meantime we can still ride it out for a bit more gains. 

**5. Panic**

**It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with margin calls and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&amp;P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance.  In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.**

Don’t let this be you, but if it is, just sit tight and buy once prices drop. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Finally**, a good warning sign that the market is entering bubble territory is the widespread use of the following expressions by supposed experts:

* “Our only problems are the problems of success”
* “Prices have adjusted to a new paradigm in which higher valuations will be the norm”
* “Globalization/communications technology/freer trade/wealthy investors from some part of the world you’ve never heard of justify these higher prices”
* And, of course, “this time, it’s different”.

It won’t be.

**What you should do:**

* Watch out for these warning signs
* When we start seeing mass hysteria and even more inflated prices, start hedging your bets with shorts or put options

personalfinance,Two(?) options to get out of debt to buy house,"Hi there.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to buy my first home in the next year or so. I'm 27 currently renting which costs on average $725/mo with everything included. Annual income is 60k. Monthly mortgage range for me is likely to be $1,000 to 1,300.  I have 2 roommates. One is thinking about moving across the country for work. My landlord is also a realtor and when we first toured, he said if we use him as a realtor and buy a house, our lease can be broken at no cost. So that is a great perk and great to not worry about lining up dates like that. If I did buy, I would likely have the roommate that is not moving, be one of my tenents and my GF would also likely move in. I have already been pre-approved for a $250k house if I put down 5%. I likely would buy something less than this as this is the max amount I'd spend on my first house. I know, I did  the pre-approval process a little early as I won't be buying for awhile. Oh well! Currently, I have 25k saved for a down payment. Save 8-10% to my 401k with a 6% employer match. Another 10% to employee stock purchase discounted at 15% of market value. Have another Roth IRA (haven't contributed to this in awhile since I have a 401k now) with 17k. My total assets are about 60k and debts are at $19,700 which include student loans ($8500, 0% interest now due to covid but usually are at 3.9%, Federal Loans) and a car loan ($11,180, 3.79% interest rate, original amount was $18,000).

I am thinking of selling or trading in my car. Have been offered $16,500 cash or $17,500 for a trade in. I would use the remaining money to buy a car in the 5,000-8,000 range to eliminate having a car payment and save on insurance costs since I wouldn't need comprehensive coverage. Risk more repairs/maintenance costs with an older, higher mileage car. I do love my car and its safety features. Also gets great gas mileage. I also just bought tires for $981. It's also EXTREMELY fun to drive. But do I need it? Probably not.. I put $6000 toward the down payment and have paid $6783 to the loan.

So. I am bouncing between two options to potentially get all my debt taken care of.

Option 1.) KILL THE DEBT. I would do this by using that 25k saved up for the down payment and pay off my car (not selling) and student loans. This would leave 5-6k leftover. I would then have an extra $500 per month to save toward the down payment account and this could be rebuilt fairly quickly. I would most likely stop contributing to the stock purchase program and put that 10% of my paycheck to saving for the down payment too, meaning $1000/mo. going back into this fund until buying. I have also thought about just selling the car. Getting rid of the debt by selling would free up over 11k that I don't need to use from the down payment account. Then, I would just need $8500 to pay off the student loans. In this case, I would have 16,500 left over which again, could be rebuilt even quicker by being able to save that $1000 and putting back into the account! I'm slightly leary of where student loans are headed due to covid. Will some be forgiven? Reduced amount or rate? Who knows. I'm not banking on this but I also only have a monthly payment $125. Seems like I have a couple options if I take this route.

Option 2.) Just keep chugging along. This path would just include keep making payments toward the loans and slightly reducing retirement savings in the short-term to build the down payment account a little more. I would cut the stock purchase savings and put that 10% to this account. This is the otherside of the arguement... Almost everyone has student loans and/or car payments. I get that. BUT, I understand it's better to not be in debt! In my case, my rates are fairly low and I don't have a crazy high monthly payment. The car payment is a little higher than I'd like but it is definitely viable.

personalfinance,Where to allocate an extra $1300?,"Hi guys

Sorry if this is dumb, just conflicted on what to do with an extra paycheck this month.

I am getting an extra check for $1300 this month at some point, and was wondering where to allocate it. (All my living, saving expenses covered by my regular paycheck)

Right now I have:

\- a 2 month living expenses savings

\- 1k credit card debt - 0% APR until April 2021

\- 2k credit card debt - 0% APR until March 2022

\- $8,500 in a car loan - 6% rate - $270 monthly payment (after being super aggressive in the first year,I can pay off the car by making minimum payments in 2 years - so 2 years early but would rather speed it up)

CC debt is from a stupid root canal/crown on a back molar last month :/ I split it between the 2 cards

So what should I do with the $1,300?

I think bolstering the savings even more is pointless right now because of the debt I have - once I clear out more debt there will be more money to go on savings.

Credit card debt is 0% APR for many months, I'm ok with making monthly payments it would be like 250/month until January for card 1, and like $120 for card 2 until January 2022. No interest accrued at all, and I can always just put extra money on it every month.

Car debt, with the interest rate sounds like the most reasonable place to drop the whole amount, although I would also consider doing like 50-50 on CC and car loan.

What would be the smartest thing to do?",finance

My spouse has $77k of CC debt, and we're looking at options for how we go about handling it.  We would appreciate any advice you have for us.

Some details:  The interest rates on these cards are pretty high (15-20%), and they are spread out between 7 cards / 4 banks. Average account balance is $11k.  None are shared accounts.

Here are the options we're considering:

1. Pay it all off with a HELoC. We have a zero-balance HELoC around 5% interest that would cover the CC debt, and then we make payments for the next several years until all the debt is gone.
2. Miss payments for 90 days / attempt to negotiate settlements (hoping 30-50% of debt forgiven). Aside from forgiven loan balances being taxable income, we don't understand all the consequences here.
3. Spouse declares bankruptcy. Given my spouse's job (&lt;$40k/yr) there is no way the debt will be payable without help from my income. We're both uncomfortable with the idea of a bankruptcy on our history, and from what we feel we don't like this idea very much.

So my husband and I are in our mid 40s. We live in a lower COL city in an area with some of the lowest wages in the country, and have no kids. Because our effective tax rate is so low (about 15% federal &amp; state combined generally), we've been investing in Roth IRAs for the last 12 years, both of us maxing ours each year. My husband also has a small Roth 401k, but for the most part, our jobs have not offered any 401k programs, so most of our investments are in the Roth IRAs. Our income is likely to stay in the same effective tax bracket going forward, as wages here are generally low overall.

Our annual spending, including our mortgage, is very low, only about $22-25k per year, average. We own our home, which will be paid for in about 5 years, lowering our average annual bills to around $15k

My question is this:

There is a standard deduction to play with, which will likely be MORE than our annual spending, by all appearances, making our ~~AGI~~ *taxable income* effectively $0 ~~or even negative~~. Our state does not tax Social Security income. So by having all our money tied up in Roth accounts, are we missing an opportunity to avoid some taxes? That is something I never thought about until recently. We have reached a point we have some extra money to invest, so are going to start a taxable brokerage account to invest some additional, but almost all the rest (except the match from hubby's Roth 401k, which of course is a regular 401k) is Roth money.

It seems like if our ~~AGI~~ *taxable income* will be likely be ~~negative~~ *$0* many or even most years, and you don't get a refund on taxes you paid in at the beginning, we might as well get SOME write off now on money going forward, even if it is at a low effective tax rate. We could save 15% in taxes now versus potentially 0% later if we're under the standard deduction.

Am I missing something here, or does that logic make sense? We'd still have most of our retirement in Roth, but it seems like having some as tax free now to be drawn as taxable within the standard deduction later would be smart.

So unless I""m missing something, we were thinking we should just let our Roth accounts grow on their own, and start investing in traditional IRAs going forward, at least until we cut back on hours enough to be under the standard deduction again.",finance

personalfinance,My girlfriend and I are planning to buy a house together in 12-18 months. How much of a negative impact will her bankruptcy 2 years ago (Oct 2018) have on our ability to get a loan?,"Location: Seattle, WA, USA

**Edit:** *While I appreciate the advice about buying a property with someone I'm not married to, I am hoping to get advice about the impact of a bankruptcy in this situation. We're comfortable with the steps we've taken and will take to protect ourselves legally during this transaction.*

=-=-=-=-=-=-

Our housing needs: We're both divorced, with kids, and want to live where her child can continue to attend the same school. To do this, we'll need both of our incomes to afford a mortgage on a home large enough for all 4 of us.

Her financial details: She earns over $100K/yr, and her income is necessary for us to afford a comfortably sized house in the neighborhood(s) we're looking to buy. She has a bankruptcy from October 2018. She currently rents her home.

My financial details: I earn slightly more, but under $150K/yr, and have 790+ credit score in all 3 credit bureaus. I recently bought a home, and will keep it as a rental when we move in together. I own another rental property, and am refinancing now with these great interest rates, to take out equity to be in position to buy in 12-18 months.

My question: how much will her bankruptcy impact our ability to get a mortgage? Will it simply bump up the interest rate, or is it possible we won't be able to borrow with her on the mortgage? What steps can we take now in preparation for buying in our desired time frame to mitigate the effects of her bankruptcy in a lender's point of view?",finance

Plans to File Antitrust Charges Against Google in Coming Weeks,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage)

Key Excerpts:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Justice Department plans to bring an antitrust case against Google as soon as this month, after Attorney General William P. Barr overruled career lawyers who said they needed more time to build a strong case against one of the world’s wealthiest, most formidable technology companies, according to five people briefed on internal department conversations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justice Department officials told lawyers involved in the antitrust inquiry into Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to wrap up their work by the end of September, according to three of the people. Most of the 40-odd lawyers who had been working on the investigation opposed the deadline. Some said they would not sign the complaint, and several of them left the case this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Brianna Herlihy, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the continuing investigation. Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for Google, said that the company would “continue to engage with ongoing investigations” and that its business practices enabled “increased choice and competition.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Justice Department amassed powerful evidence of anticompetitive practices, three people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the lawyers also described internal politics that at times slowed down the department’s work or drove a wedge among members of the team.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For nearly a year, dozens of Justice Department lawyers and other staff members worked in two groups, each overseeing a separate line of inquiry: Google’s dominance in search and its control over many aspects of the ecosystem for online advertising.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Google controls about 90 percent of web searches globally, and rivals have complained that the company extended its dominance by making its search and browsing tools defaults on phones with its Android operating system. Google also captures about one-third of every dollar spent on online advertising, and its ad tools are used to supply and auction ads that appear across the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech seems to have picked up with Google in the Trump Administrations crosshairs. Despite broad bipartisan support in Congress and amongst 50 state AGs, there seems to be some politicking, or at least the appearance of such, that could slow down the government's case. AG Barr wants to file charge against Google by the end of September.",finance

personalfinance,Do I deserve a raise?,"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit...

&amp;#x200B;

I've worked at a country club for the last 5 years. I served tables for 3 years, bartended for one year, and then was promoted to Accounts Payable and have been in this position for one year. I currenly get paid $23.46 an hour - hourly, not salary.

As we all know, 2020 has been a shit show, but REAL bad at my job. Several months ago, the marketing director quit. Then, the general manager passed away. Then, one of the two food and beverage managers just put in his two weeks, and several other employees are also seeking other employment opportunities.

My boss has now assumed the responsibilities of the general manager. He said he is not planning on hiring anyone to replace those who have quit until next year. Therefore, they have taken their job responsibilities and spread them out among the remaining admin staff. So, now I'm not only doing accounts payable, but I am also creating and sending marketing emails, keeping track of marketing activity within our membership, maintaining our website, and now I'm being asked to also do some IT work, such as coordinate operations with our outside IT company, set up new programs to integrate with our system, and attend online training to learn more about how to add new modules to our systems, etc.

I believe I should be asking for a raise, but some part of me feels like I'm going to be told NO. They claim they are struggling with finances, but I know this is not true as I see all of our bank accounts on a daily basis. The GM's large salary is no longer being paid, nor is the marketing directors or the food and beverage manager.

I was hired to do accounts payable - that was the job I agreed to do, and $23.46 was the amount we agreed I would be paid for THAT job. I understand the circumstances were not foreseeable, and I'm trying my best to be a team player - but I'm getting fed up that more and more work is being thrown at me with no offer of any compensation, just a ""thanks for everything"" at the end of each day from my boss.

Some things that make me feel as if he will say no is that he sees me use my personal cell phone during work hours - which I was NEVER told was not allowed. I send a few texts during the day and will occasionally scroll through Facebook. He's also seen me on Reddit a few times, but nothing major.

&amp;#x200B;

My coworker in Accounts Receivable has been working here for 20+ years and only gets paid $25 an hour. She is also in charge of payroll, and I also worry that she will see my raise and get upset that I've been given a raise...although that's on HER to ask for one for herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also moving out of the country in 6 months - which is why I'm not interested in going to find another job. I'd like to use my sick days, my vacation days, my longevity day, and get my Christmas bonus before I leave. But a raise for the next 6 months of work would be nice.

Anyway - sorry for the long post. I'd just like to know if I'm justified in asking for a raise, and how much I should ask for???

personalfinance,Help me decide what to do about an unreliable car,"Thanks in advance for any advice you can give me.

I've been working on my personal finance journey thanks to this sub over the past few years, so I really want to make the decision that will best serve that idea moving forward.

I have a 2015 Honda Fit (bought new in Sept. '14, paid off early, 80k miles). I like it because of its MPG, cargo space, and small size making it good for parking in the city and for going on camping/road trips.

However, 2 years ago I started having frequent problems with the car not starting and making a very loud rattling noise when it did start. I had the starter replaced twice, I've taken it to multiple repair shops and multiple dealerships. It's always ""a loose/corroded wire"" or sometimes they aren't even sure why. I've been stranded and have had the car towed at least 5 times the past two years due to these issues. The same thing happened again yesterday, and while it was only a $20 repair to fix a loose wire, I don't trust the car to start when I need it to, especially since I like driving to more remote locations.

The problem is that I wanted to drive this car into the ground, but this doesn't really seem like ""the ground."" How can I justify buying a different car when this car is still so new? I have $5500 saved up for a different car and the car trade-in should be around $6000. I'm looking at used cars (Kia Souls, Toyota Rav4) in that price range to pay out of pocket but most are older and with more mileage than my current car.  I'm also taking a gamble on their reliability as well. I don't want to finance a used car because of current interest rates (even with 800+ credit score) and it seems wasteful to finance a new car.

Looking for advice from all, but I would especially like to hear from older people.","I had a god damn novel written out here, but you know what they say. Why waste time say lot word, when few word do trick? I’m going to make a long story short(er) and just answer questions that may pop up. 

I’m 26, I’m a nurse, and I’m burnt the fuck out. But I really need you to trust me when I say my job is as good as it gets as far as bedside goes, and switching jobs in my field is NOT going to make me happier (I’ve worked in both hospital and office nursing, they both fucking suck for their own reasons). 

I am currently thinking about going down to 30 hours per week (right now I work four 10 hour shifts, currently looking to do two 12 hour shifts one week, and three 12 hour shifts the next week for a total of 60 hours per pay check). 

I have little debt (just federal student loan and car), I contribute 10% to my 401k with a 5% company match. Cutting my hours will just mean cutting into my disposable income and the amount I contribute to personal savings. I will still contribute 10% to my 401k and keep my 5% match benefit, but obviously the amount that gets contributed will be reduced. I get a 3% raise yearly and plan on bumping my 401k contribution up by that 3% every time I get a raise. 

My take home will go from $3,200/month, to $2,400/month. My savings and disposable income will be reduced, but with my free time I do plan on trying to make some money off of my hobbies (crocheting and sewing). I already did a test run of this during peak covid when I voluntarily elected to reduce my hours to 30 hours per week. I was leagues happier not spending majority of my days at work and I survived just fine on the reduced check. 

I can keep working four 10 hour shifts and have more money to contribute to savings and retirement, but will remain resentful and exhausted. Or I can reduce my time around the only stressor in my life, I can spend more time doing things I love, and spend more time being happy while I’m young and life is otherwise great.

personalfinance,taking out a loan for school and using the money to pay off parent's debt,"Hi, 

So im going into college full-time and my expenses will be about $500-$600 per month (which includes rent and food, since financial aid covers a lot of my other costs). I will be working part time to cover these costs. I do not need to take a loan out for my school, however, my single parent has over 10k in loans that they have been trying to pay off for the past 6 years or so. I am, however, approved to take out **$8k** in loans, which is as follows:

* **3.5k** direct-sub1 (Repayment of principal and interest begins six months after graduation)
* **2k** direct-unsub1 (interest begins accruing immediately. Students are charged quarterly for the amount of accrued interest. They may either pay it or allow it to be added to the loan principal. Repayment of principal and accrued interest begins six months after the student graduates, withdraws, or attends school less than half time.)
* **2.5k** school loan (The interest rate is 5%. The interest does not accrue until repayment begins. Repayment begins nine months after you graduate)

Is it smart to take out some/all of these loans to pay off my parent's debt? I have come to the realization that my parent is not in the best state of mind and will give me comfort and peace of mind knowing that they are taken care of, at least mentally and financially for the next few years if they do not have any debt to weigh them down. Also, this means that if anything were to happen to me financially, they would be in a much better position to help me out if need be. I am going into a lucrative major and feel like I will have a well-paying job out of college.

My parent also might not be able to work due to health reasons after the next 4-6 years, so I know for a fact that I will have to carry the burden of providing for my parent (fully) after I graduate school....this also means that they are able to save for retirement since they currently have no savings or anything of that sense.

personalfinance,What's the best way to figure out what's more effective--refinancing into a 15 year mortgage or just paying extra principal on existing mortgage?,"Hi folks, with the super low interest rates out there right now, there's been some discussion in our house about refinancing, whether that's into another 30 year (not my preference because we don't exactly need cash and I want to be conservative and would rather get more equity than have money now and paying more interest over time) or into a 15 year mortgage.

Here's the basic details. Current mortgage balance after \~5-6 years of ""ownership"" is \~$472,000 (very high COL area, and estimated value of the house is \~$875k-$950k right now). Current interest rate is  3.875%. I pay \~$2625/month just in mortgage (property tax adds like another $650-$700/month) and  pay an additional $100-$200 each payment toward principal, and could increase that if desired. 

I'm still investigating what a new 15 year mortgage would look like, but it seems like it could be as low as 2.25% right now, with a payment around $3,100 or $3,200 / month. While that's more, it's not completely uncomfortable. 

So how do I figure out how much I'd be losing out on in terms of interest if I just bumped my current payment to add $400-$500 / month principal to get close to that 15 year rate vs refinancing into a lower interest 15 year mortgage? The benefit of not refinancing is if things ever got weird I could revert to the lower payment. But it would also be awesome to increase equity quickly and avoid paying the bank when I don't have to. I don't see myself staying in this house for even 15 more years let alone 25 (we absolutely love the neighborhood but the house is small for our growing family and I think any construction would be quite expensive and difficult as we live on a hillside, so I feel like 5 more years is probably the max). 

Just trying to get a sense of how to navigate the lure of these low interest rates with the ultimate goal of saving money while being wary of stretching ourselves too thin. Thanks for any thoughts.",finance

personalfinance,Freaking Out Over House Payments / Value,"I recently bought a house that is much too big for me that costs $228k. I can't stop thinking about how much money I'll be wasting here instead of renting, I got suckered in with low interest rates to becoming a first time home owner. Am I being overly frugile? I haven't been able to eat or sleep since the seller's agent won't let me out of the contract. I also worry I paid way too much, 2 years ago the house sold for $193k which really hurts, the seller hardly did anything to it. But I bet it will appraise appropriately since the market is now hot. I worry I bought it at the peak and will lose money if I sell it down the road, especially having to pay realtor's commissions this could be costly.

I luckily have 100k saved, a gross income of 85k, and no debt besides the mortgage, but need to put 20% down and pay closing costs still. It will be a total of $1138 / month at 2.5% per year for 30 years, the first few months only around 341 goes to principal, so I'm losing around $800 to interest, taxes, and insurance. This may sound reasonable but I'll also have to pay to heat and cool larger areas as well as maintenance, so I'm anticipating an extra $200 more for that per month than I'm paying now. I'll also have to sink a few grand into furniture, lawn mower, snow blower, washer and dryer.

My rent is currently $545 per month and I have 0 maintenance to do. I really feel like I made the wrong decision here. I'm easily spending over $400 more per month for a bunch of space I don't need, and will now have to do maintenance myself. Has anyone else regretted buying a house, and gone back to renting a few years after home ownership? I feel like a prisoner because I'll have to hold it 2 - 5 years or longer, each year losing around $5k as opposed to renting.

Yes this house would be a good deal for someone with a family, but my girlfriend and I are possibly breaking up and her and her son were going to move in. It feels like a double punch to the gut. And I don't have any leads on a roommate I could rent one of the extra rooms to.

Edit: I have not closed and have talked to my real estate attorney. Long story short I can't back out without big repercussions. They can sue me for damages and legal fees. I already offered leaving the earnest money to leave the contract and they declined, there is nothing that specifically allows me to do that without the sellers permission. That is, the seller is being an ass and instead of taking my earnest money threatened to sue, which is well within their legal rights.",finance

Takes six years to the make back what they printed out of thin air for coronavirus and are willing to print again which begs the question why do we even pay taxes anymore if we can just print money out of thin air? We have a whole movement of people: the AOC crowd wake up every day and they say modern monetary theory, the actual supply, doesn't matter. All that matters is how much can we print and get away with it. This is where we're at as an economy right now and globally speaking a lot of other nations agree with this. So, given that the whole world, the leadership of the world, talking about negative interest rates, they're talking about predatory financial systems hyperinflation. Just print money, modern monetary theory, just print as much cash as you want and we look to the cryptocurrency industry, and god, we got a lot of problems...

I think this (week's market) collapse is probably because one of the most prominent exchanges in South Korea got hit. They got shut down by the South Korean government and they at one time were responsible for a big part of the Kimchi premium and you know what? Korean government might shut down a few more Korean exchanges and usually the market based these things in. We got crazy yield farming weird stuff going on in the DeFi space. All these other local events and their blips they don't really matter that much just like corona in the long term won't matter too much in terms of the markets. What matters is the trend and where are we going. I had a meeting with some people this morning and we talked about revolutionizing the healthcare industry and getting things better in terms of supply chains. I had another meeting with a soon-to-be former Wyoming state representative about how we're going to get governments to adopt blockchain technology. I talk every day to governors, heads of state, congressmen, senators, mayors. Some cities, sometimes very large cities, with millions of people and they all say the same thing. We need help, we need solutions, we're damn tired of the way that the old system is running. You know what? if we don't solve it a lot of people are going to get hurt or continue to be hurt.

The common theme that we all have is no one's happy. Look at the black-lives-matter protests, taking their philosophy of the organization aside, the rank and file people are there not because they love Marxism. They're there because they're unhappy with the way society is and why shouldn't they be? When my grandfather, got his first job, on my mom's side, out of the Korean war, he was a lineman and he made enough money from that job to have seven kids and have his wife stay at home. No college degree, fresh out of high school, fresh out of marine demolitions and a lineman. Five boys and two girls and he could take care of that family and save money every month. Have a car and a house and that was his standard of living. How many people in the middle class today in the United States or Europe for that matter have the ability on a single person's salary to raise seven children and have the wife or the husband stay at home? How many people, not many, why? because our monetary system has failed us. The inflationary policy has created a situation where the Jeff Bezos can have 200 billion dollars and make windfall profits every year regardless of how bad the economy is. The everyday people they don't get a pay increase, so in a lot of cases they don't get to keep their job and their money deteriorates in value a lot more than three percent per year.

Our industry has principles in that we worship the math and the protocols and the stable monetary policy. These types of things, and as corrupt as some of the exchanges can be, and some of the bad actors are, all movements suffer from these warts, and they're finite and temporary. You run out of them. At some point self-regulation kicks in or standards kick in and these bad actors flush out and what's left behind is a crucible that contains the truth of the matter which is: we're going to win as an industry. There's just no doubt in my mind. You have bad days in the market, you have damn good days in the market, you get addicted to the good ones and you hate the bad ones but at the end of the day it's only going in one direction which is crypto is going to eat the world: every voting system, every property registration system, every monetary system, the next 25 to 50 years is going to be running on the tech we build and others build and running with the principles of power to the edges.

This is the great challenge of our time. To do it in a way that it's fair, transparent, open and doesn't allow a government to co-opt it. It's gonna be a lot of fights here. The least of our concerns and matters are a red day and every now and then I like making these videos to remind people why I'm here and why you should be here too. As toxic as the trolls could be and these other people can be, none of them really matter. Markets don't really matter, what matters are the principles and the purpose behind what we do and you have to ask yourself are you happy with the way that society is? Are you happy with the money in your pocket? Are you happy with the political leadership representing your nations? Are you happy with your future and do you honestly believe if we keep doing the things that we did and continue to do that the future is going to be better or do you think it's going to be worse or stagnant?

I think too many people have woken up and they realize that if we continue doing the things that we do the future is going to be a bad place and they don't want that to happen. We're voting with our wallets, we're voting with our feet and we as a collective industry are waking up and figuring out how to build something better and there's some good days and bad days along the way. Today's a bad one but there are going to be good days tomorrow just like I told you back when corona made everything go into free fall and I told you before and I warned you about with ICO mania.

We're in a DeFi bubble right now, there's no doubt in my mind about that. I saw it in 2017 with ICO mania. I see it here and there's probably going to be worse days ahead in that respect but the trend is always the same and never forget that and never forget that real people are actually adopting these systems and using them. Every day we see more and more and every day that movement grows and what's so humbling is that I know a lot of you are here with me. It used to be pretty lonely space to be in a few years back. You know, the conferences, they didn't have many people. My first bitcoin meetup group in 2011 in Colorado is at the gypsy house cafe I think, in Denver. I registered for the event I showed up. Two people registered myself and another guy and the other guy didn't show up so I had coffee with myself. Compare that with the Shelley summit that we had in July of 2020. 10 000 attendees, 10 000 from all across the world, compare that to where we are at today just nine years later pretty amazing if you think about how fast things have grown and how many fertile beautiful ideas exist in this industry and what this industry is doing for the world as a whole.

That is why we're going to win because at the end of day who can argue against freedom? Who can argue against liberty? Who can argue against putting people in control? The only way you can is when you believe people are stupid, people are evil, people are incapable and I suppose that's a philosophical difference between those who currently lead and the people who want to replace them. The people in charge right now of the world, the big banks, the fortune 500 companies, the media, Hollywood... These things, they're very cynical, people who believe in the worst in us they look at everyday people who sustain and disgust and say these people if left to their own devices will be chaos. These people, if left to govern themselves will burn everything to the ground and destroy everything and every single time I have ever seen a bad event happen what the news doesn't show you and what those people don't talk about is how we come together and help each other out. Someone gets injured in the streets more often than not people show up and help them, people need a helping hand. Someone always shows up more often than not and this is no different. I don't believe the political process is effective anymore in any modern democracy. They've all been co-opted, perhaps they always were but what I do believe is that we can come together and change things economically which is what we're doing.

It's messy building our own money, it is messy building our own industry, it is messy. We make a lot of mistakes along the way. We lose a lot along the way, we collect some scars too while we're at it but progress every year keeps being made. The technology every year keeps getting better. Today, right here right now, provably secure proof of stake protocols are in circulation. They were a fantasy five years ago now they're a fact of life today. Right here right now snarks have evolved by an order of magnitude in every category from validation time to efficiency to proof size in all favorable ways which opens up all kinds of new applications and scalability and privacy. Today, right here right now, layer 2 protocols are more advanced than they have ever been in our industry's history giving us the ability to build payment systems that scale to billions of people. Today, right here right now, we are seeing massive innovations in governance and a fertile environment for things like approval voting, threshold voting, preference voting, quadratic voting, that will enable us to build all kinds of new treasuries and governance systems that eventually will scale to nation states.

As the politicians of today argue whether the post office can properly count paper ballots that people mail we are building voting systems with state-of-the-art cryptography living on phones where you can vote. It's just a tap of a button and enjoy more security than we have ever imagined before. That is the future this movement, is enabling humanity money flowing at the speed of thought and the speed of thought making new money. How can you compete with that? You can't unless you bring people down with cynicism and disdain and ultimately what competing vision do they offer? That you all should be in chains? That we should just be wage slaves? We should just accept that every year our money deteriorates in value? That we should just accept that the rich will get richer the poor get poorer? Every now and then they throw us table scraps and when we get real angry they usurp the movements and then install their own leadership to basically take those movements from us as we've seen so many times before and we will see again. I'm sorry that's not a road I want to walk down and I'm willing to ride rocky waters, crazy markets, crazy people in unlimited FUD and trolling but I will never apologize for believing in the best in people and I will never apologize for believing that if only we give everyone around us the tools to save themselves and society that they can do it.

They don't need great leaders and charisma. No one needs someone to tell them what to do. We all know what to do. We all know how to make the world a better place. We just have to be trusted enough to do it ourselves. You know what for the first time ever we did with bitcoin and then we did it again with ethereum and now we're doing it again with Cardano and we as a movement will continue to do it.

I believe our best days are ahead of us and every day I wake up and there's more people marching with me in that respect and one day it'll be millions and one day it'll be billions and one day all those cynics will be gone, replaced with optimists, who once again believe that tomorrow is going to be better than today and that we're going to leave the world just a little bit better than the way we found it. So, every now and then on a tough day I like making a little message and letting you guys all know it's going to be better and you know what? it will be. Just have to have faith that it will be. So, hold the line, hold strong and have faith in each other and go do something, build something, start something.

Got a lot of podcasts on the way, a lot of things coming down the pipe. For the dc-fund, a lot of opportunities to actually innovate. Multi assets are coming, soon Plutus is coming, soon guys are going to be able to build a lot. Start thinking today what's the business plan? What would you like to change, small or large. You don't complain about voting. Change voting. Your own organization, maybe you belong to a club, do a blockchain-based voting system. Maybe you have some political influence? Have a primary, democrat or republican, or your local primary or country for selecting candidates done with blockchain-based voting. Maybe you want to build a new financial product? Think about it, figure it out. There's so much there, it's all there, it's ready to go, it's for you to take and build and innovate with.

Every day I wake up I try to make the platforms better. I try to push the technology a little further along. I try to hire great people and bring them into our industry. Cardano brought the Haskell industry into the cryptocurrency space. Cardano brought a lot of academics who had never thought about cryptocurrencies into the cryptocurrency space and we made our problems their problems and as a consequence they started solving them in ways we could have never done before. Most importantly Cardano brought a lot of you into the cryptocurrency space and you never thought you'd have this level of control and freedom over the fabric of society in the direction of the human race. Don't let that slip through your fingers. Figure out what you want to do with that super power. Might be small, might be big. I dreamed big, you can dream big too, even if you want to just dream small. Every person counts, every action counts up to the hill. Y'all matter to me and to each other and we're all in this together, never forget that! So, hard day, rough day, tomorrow will be a better one. The day after will even be better. See you guys soon, take care...

personalfinance,Best place to put capitol gains,"So I'm about to close on the sale of my house, and move out of state. While I am looking to buy a new house in my new state, I intend on getting a low interest mortgage for it. I'll use some of the house sale money for a down payment but will hold a bulk of it back to invest slightly. I figure since interest rates for mortgages are so low it would be a better way to go, but my question is: where to put the proceeds of the house sale as a good place to invest.

A little background: the gutters on the rear of my home are pretty f'ed up, and as a result everytime it rains my basement floods. I reached out back in MARCH for estimates and in April, told this company to go ahead with the replacement.

I've heard nothing from them since April. Now this week, I receive a $550 bill due in 30 days. Thing is, nothing has been done and I've yet to receive any timetable on when they'll even begin the work. Back in April it was going to be a ""few weeks"" because weather had them busy (roofing).  Now, 4 months later with no contact in between I get a bill.

I've never had to deal with contractors before, but is this common practice? I'd always heard you generally don't/shouldn't do full up-front payment? And besides that in the intervening 4 months with no word I'd more or less given up on this company and reached out to another, who's estimate came in at under 1/2 the first companies estimate. Am I beholden to the first offer since I accepted it (by email) or can I back out, since nothing was officially signed? I normally wouldn't do this since I agreed to them initially, but between the months long delay, lack of communication, and now a bill for something they haven't even reached out to say when they're starting on - let alone already done - just has me questioning this company.",finance

gaming,IGN is untrustworthy and shouldn’t be a measuring stick for how good a game is.,"I see a lot of people hide behind the review from ign or the score from metacritic when there game is getting criticized. 
 
""Critically acclaimed"" is not a substantial argument. Many of those reviews don't see or refuse to see flaws of the game. Partially because this game takes a long time to finish and reviewers have limited amount of it.

For example IGN wrote this about skyrim: 


“*The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat.*”

as a positive, when for a lot of players this would be a negative.

“*Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge.*”

He praises colossal amount of content without paying attention to quality and overhypes the exploration. No, something unexpected doesn't often lies just over the next ridge and it's not every step you make is exiting, not even close to it. And not even close to it even as a hyperbole.

“*Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table.*”

Yes, it has it purpose and it's most of the time completely useless contrary to what he is trying to say.

“*Killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force.*”

Yes, and he fails to mention how rigid and limited shouting system is and how useless a lot of shouts are not to mention visually unimpressive. You have only ONE button. A hotkey that is shared with powers, a completely different skill section. To change one shout to another, you have to either open menu and manually switch shouts (I don't think I need to explain why this is bad) or assign them with hotkeys (1-8 and you use them for weapons, potions, food, spells and powers so you have very limited space) or open favourite menu which pauses the game and waste your time searching for shout you want (which breaks the base and interrupt the combat). Terribly thought out system that only unique feature is using dragon souls to empower and learn new shouts.

Do you know what the best part is? On PC you have a console interfece. And you know what is even better? That this flaw is nowhere to be found in review.

“*Not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding.*”

This is completely laughable. This civil war in Skyrim was pathetic and it took like 2-3 small battles to end the conflict. Shitty writing does not allow to fiction become denser or rich.

“*This is a world that rewards the obsessive and the adventurous, one where creative quest designs are the standard across primary and secondary storylines, not the exception*”

Creative quest design. Biggest joke of this decade.

“*For such a complex game, Skyrim is surprisingly user-friendly*”

This guy calls this game complex.

“*Weapon and armor designs are fantastically detailed, to the point where the increased damage or armor bonus for a new piece of gear is usually less exciting than the opportunity to marvel at its design.*”

Fantastically, or maybe they are just good? Nope, gotta overhype as many features and items as possible.

All he does is use flowery language and praises the game. He only mentioned 2 problems which are interface and bugs (which he also tried to excuse with game being too complex instead of developers being either lazy or incompetent and stated they are not big deal). Rest of the time instead he tries to praise features in game which obviuosly are meaningless, bad or outright terrible and overhype anything that game does remotely good. Bad AI? Nope. Bad combat system? Nope. Repetitive NPC and voice actors? Nope. Shallow NPCs? Nope. Bad and repetitive dungeon design? Nope. Weirdly small towns? Nope. Terrible writing (especially main quest)? Nope. Unbalanced classes? Nope. Consequences of your actions? Nope. Bad aminations? Nope. Magic becoming more and more useless in higher level content? Nope. Factions being ridiculosly simplified? Nope. Uncreative and unoriginal shout system? Nope. Dragons being killed by some randoms? Nope. Crime system being flawed? Nope. Climatic final fight? Also nope. Bad reward system for completing dungeons? Not in a million years. Terrible physics? Guess what... also nope. And it was rated 95 on IGN. Objective and substantial review my ass
 
And people think these people are objective, LOL

Think for yourself instead of trying to support your statement with ""critically acclaimed"" argument.

personalfinance,Retired man looking for advice on how to survive,"My uncle is in a terrible situation. I am making this post with his permission on his behalf. I was talking with my cousin (his daughter) and she mentioned that he was having some financial trouble recently. She wasn't trying to ask for money, but she was asking for advice. I am in marketing, not really finance so not exactly my forte but she's a nurse so I guess I am more ""business-savy"" in her eyes. Anyhow..

He is retired, has a wife and 2 kids (both adults living on their own). He is well into his late 70s, however his wife is 10 years younger and has been a house wife her entire life. His total income is around 2500 a month with social security and pension. He has no 401k. I pulled him aside and we went over all of his expenses. 


Mortgage 1550

Groceries (includes incidentals like batteries and light bulbs) 300

Cell phone(both him and wife) 80

Electric 120

Water 60

Cable + Internet 140

Oil Heat (monthly average) 100

Travel 150

Car payment 225

car insurance 110

car maintenance (estimate to set aside) 50

house maintenance (estimate to set aside) 100

HOA 50

Credit Cards 850


As you can see, the total without Credit cards is around 3000. After some discussion, it appears he's been putting things on his credit card for the past 15 years that he couldn't afford (car maintenance for example) and now it's snowballed into 50k in credit card debt. He's already 500 short every month (or 350 if you don't save for car or house maintenance), so I don't think he can afford living in his current place. I talked to my cousin, then her parents about it and they all agreed my aunt and uncle need to downsize the house anyhow. They are now in the process of selling things they don't need and looking for a new place with less maintenance. 


My first question to all of you is, what options does he have out of the massive credit card debt? I don't think he'll be net positive till he sells the house, and even if he does get a small 1 bedroom condo with his wife, I think the condo fees and mortgage in this area of the country will still be around 900-1000 minimum. We came up with 2 possible options. 1 is bankruptcy, and 2 is trying to negotiate with the CC companies. His kids have both said they are willing to help out with 250 each a month if it will help for the next few years. That can bring his income to 3000 which would just about net his current expenses but still not include the credit card payments. Currently the creditors are giving him some kind of forbearance due to COVID but this expires next month. Has anyone had luck with negotiating with credit card companies? They are trying to avoid the bankruptcy option since they will be trying to sell this house and downsize and will then need better credit for the future mortgage. Also I believe they can come after some of the proceeds of the sale of your home if you file bankruptcy and try to sell. One way would be to file bankruptcy and stay in the house for 3-5 years till it's over, but that would put more pressure on my cousins to help chip in more than they are comfortable with, as I believe the estimate they would need to pay is around 650 for 3 years even with filing bankruptcy. I think if they can get rid of the CC debt, and downsize my aunt and uncle will be a ton better off. 

The second question is if bankruptcy is the only option, how do courts determine what they can afford. Looking at his budget I know it's pretty tight. Obviously savings and travel go out the window and they'd have to cut back elsewhere but they would probably still rely on my cousins for support. 

Third question, can my aunt apply for social security having not worked? If so, will the amount be adjusted after my uncle passes? I am worried about how she will carry on afterward. I appreciate any advice. 

Notes:

With the size of the smaller condo I would estimate the electric, heat and possibly water will reduce. 

His car will be paid off in 2.5 years time. 

My dad (his brother) isn't going to help out so that's not an option.

I know cutting the cable/internet package is another option but it's their main (only) form of entertainment since they don't go out. Even with using my cousin's netflix account they'll still need an internet connection. Maybe they can renegotiate their package, but that's not really the point of this post.

.

.

.

EDIT: Thank you for the replies! As I mentioned, they are already looking to sell things in the house and downsize. I now have answers for the social security question. I think the main question that needs answering is regarding the credit card debt. Has anyone had success reducing the total debt amount? For example, after X months of non-payment, do they open the option of settling the debt? My aunt has tried calling and was able to lower the interest rate on a couple due to consist payment history etc, and has a forbearance on others due to COVID. Any advice regarding the CC debt would be the biggest help.",finance

personalfinance,Critique my financial situation. Would you suggest getting one large loan to pay off everything?,"Just curious if it would be better to keep all loans separate or consolidate them into one large loan. Also wondering if/how that would affect obtaining a mortgage. 

Me: Credit score 690. 100% on time payments. One bad mark. It's a bankruptcy from almost 4 years ago. Low credit card usage. Basically I made a mess of things about 5 years ago but the bankruptcy cleared that up and I've been working on it ever since. 1 car loan. 8% interest. I owe about $20,000 and have 6 years left. 2 personal loans totaling about $2,500. Interest rates of 12% and 27% Credit card debt is around $1,000. Income is just over $40,000 a year. Minimum monthly debt payments is about $575. Also my credit age is low. Only about 2 years.

My husband: Low credit score. I have no idea how low it is at this point. Probably in the 400s. Collections. Late payments. Just bad all the way around. 1 car loan. Interest rate is high. I can't remember exactly what it is but I'd estimate between 17-24% $12,000 owed and he has 4 years left I believe. Collections total less than $4,000. Income is around $45,000. The only payment he makes is his car which is about $400. Credit age is 8 years. Also we filed the bankruptcy together. 

My thinking is that is we could get a loan for let's say $50,000 and pay off all of our debt and put the rest in savings. PNC is currently offering a savings account with 1% interest. I was just casually looking at loan rates and the highest rate I've seen most banks have is about 20% so if my math is correct the monthly payment would be about $1,000 if we did an 8 year term. 

If we split that it would be manageable and it would greatly help my husbands credit to have everything negative paid off. 

We are not currently interested in buying a home. But possibly within the next 3-5 years I'd say. 

I'm interested in seeing if this large loan is an option because it would be nice to be able to pay off all debt and consolidate it into one loan as well as being able to start a savings account. 

However, I'm worried about our auto loans. We both have newer cars but I don't know if they will last 8 years. I somewhat think it would be a better idea to get a loan for just enough to pay off our debt and start a savings but not pay off our cars just in case. 

Either way any opinions or advice are helpful.",finance

Is this a good idea? Assuming I go through with the deal, this is more or less in line with 20/4/10.

investing,Global Portfolio market performance seems skewed. Are we in for a lost decade?,"Here's what I'm looking at:

International Developed Markets (EU, Australia, Japan etc.) - tracked through IEFA. Basically flat since inception in 2012.

Emerging Markets (China, India, etc) - tracked through IEMG. Basically flat since inception in 2012.

US Markets - SPY has really only gone up since inception in 1993.

If it weren't for US markets, anyone who has a global approach to investing would basically have made no money.

It can be argued that US markets only did well thanks to a period of lowering interest rates for the last 40 year, plus their obvious Tech dominance.

What happens if the US goes flat for the next 10 years as interest rates can't really go down any more, and we're faced with the biggest debt bubble in history? 

How do investors who have a global portfolio make any money in that environment?

Most importantly, how do you justify International exposure when those markets have been flat for over a decade? I know there have been times when international outperformed the US, but that seems far and few in between, and I don't see how US Tech juggernauts ever give up their advantage. It seems to me global diversification has only hurt returns historically speaking vs investing purely in the US.",finance
personalfinance,College Fund for Nephew? (New to this all!),"I want to start a college fund for my nephew ( &lt; 1 years old), but am not sure what the best route is. I have no experience in finance!

Some context, outside of myself, my entire family lives in poverty, and this will certainly be the case 18 years from now, so I anticipate that my nephew would qualify for maximum federal aid when he enters college.

I have looked at 529's, Roth IRA, and also considered (but not yet looked into) some kind of bonds or high yield savings.

**Important considerations:**

I only make $24,000/year, (but I have a large emergency fund already!) so my contributions will be small to start (thinking $1,000-2,000 deposit and then $20/month). I expect to earn a reasonable income in 3-4 years (post PhD hopefully) and will increase monthly deposit accordingly. So perhaps \~10 years of $100-200/mo contributions.

The culture of my family and the lack of opportunities my nephew will face makes the possibility of him not achieving well in school, and not going to college at all, very plausible. I need to maximize the flexibility of the income in this regard. Maybe in 17 years, the money is better used buying him a car for work, tools for a trade, musical equipment, any alternative to traditional education.

I absolutely want to have the power to approve spending from whatever scenario takes place. It would be foolish to give an 18 year old free access to $20,000+.

**529:**

This looks like a good route. I can keep the money in my name and withdraw any contributions (no interest) tax+penalty free. If my nephew does go to college, all of the money (contributions+interest) is tax+penalty free. If he doesn't, but needs to use the money for something else, he has access (through me?) to direct contributions and a 10% penalty fee + taxes on total sum. (Surely 6% compound interest over enough years would make a 10% penalty fee still profitable?)

***\*My concern\**** It looks like if the 529 owner is not the parent of the beneficiary, their 529 distributions count as income in the eyes of the FAFSA, meaning his likely full federal aid would be greatly diminished. So this is worrisome to me. Should his mom open a 529 that I contribute to (I know now this involves trusting my sister not to touch the money, but I would have access to everything, it would be just hers in name)?

**Roth IRA:**

I will not be of retirement age when he is 18. This looks okay, but as his uncle, I couldn't withdraw the money penalty free for his tuition, and of course the money is never tax-free.

I guess the only reason this seems like an option is because, I can deposit a fixed amount as his college fund, say $20,000 over 17 years. That fund will build tax-free interest towards my retirement, and then I can just withdraw that $20,000 when he's in college, and pay his bills outside of the scope of the FAFSA. Of course, technically his ""fund"" won't have gained any interest this way, and I'm kind of stealing his interest, which isn't very cool.

Not sure this would make sense in any other way though.

&amp;#x200B;

**High Yield Savings:**

Is this ever the right move? I know FAFSA counts savings substantially less than income when determining aid. But would the savings account be in his name, or mine? I wouldn't want to give an 18 year old free access to $20,000+, no way. I would definitely want to approve the spending.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonds:**

Do people use bonds still? Is this worth exploring at all?

personalfinance,NJ Tax Adjustment,"TL;DR - State of NJ has sent me invoices for back taxes owed based on an amendment to 2018’s return. I believe there was a miscalculation have already submitted a claim with documentation. Do I pay the amount due and attempt to get it refunded later, or leave it pending until the claim is resolved?


After filing our 2019 tax return I realized that we didn’t claim one of our dependents on the 2018 return (stepson, we alternate years with his dad, I mixed up the years. D’oh). I filed an amendment and submitted with our taxes this year. Both were done on TurboTax, and if I remember correctly, both showed we should have received an additional refund. 

Fast forward to June, our federal amended refund came in, but we received a notice from NJ showing an additional $476 owed. I looked at the amendments, found where I believe the error arose from showing an incorrect total taxable income (I can look back at my notes and post here if needed, cannot remember it off the top of my head), and filed a claim online 7/1/2020. 

NJ division of taxation says to leave 90 days for a claim to be resolved, but in the 60ish days since filing I’ve received 2 more invoices for the same underpayment. I’m starting to worry that it will go to collections. Should I just pay it, and hope to get it refunded once the claim is resolved?? Or do I hold out and wait for a resolution, as there is likely a payment that should be coming to me?",finance
investing,Fidelity says we're in an early cycle bull market - do you guys agree?,"Source: [https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/markets-sectors/bull-market-highs?ccsource=email\_weekly](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/markets-sectors/bull-market-highs?ccsource=email_weekly)

Key takeaways from the article:

* The stock market hit new highs last week, and the history of market cycles suggests that the current bull market trend could continue for some time to come.
* In terms of the business cycle, the US economy is out of recession and into an early cycle recovery.
* In addition, the market continues to display characteristics of a secular bull market. Secular bull markets are prolonged super-cycles in which the market produces above average returns.
* Factors supporting the secular thesis include de-equitization (the number of public stocks is declining), a highly accommodative monetary policy, and a weaker dollar.

personalfinance,"I've been pre-approved for a mortgage, but is buying a condo realistic for me?","I'm currently renting an apartment in a Denver, CO suburb and have been here for 7 years as I established a stable career. I was pre-approved for up to $380K conventional loan back in March. Due to, you know, everything that started happening in March, I ultimately decided to extend my lease for 9 months, leaving me to give my 60-day intent to vacate notice in about December. Obviously, that pre-approval has expired, but there have been no changes in my personal finances since I was pre-approved, except perhaps a better interest rate. Here are my basics (all of which were used by loan officer to determine my approval):

-$63.5K annual salary. I normally receive a 3% raise at year end; however, my company will be ceasing raises this year in order to keep us all employed

-Negligible 401K: I only started contributing to a 401K last year and unfortunately my employer has ceased its match for the same reasons as above

-Credit score of about 805

-I could put approximately $15-18K down for a down payment based on savings and a bit of help from my parents

-I have no debts (no car or student payments, no credit card debt)

-I'm currently paying ~$1,600 in rent (it has gone up ~$400 over the course of the 7 years I've lived here and is the cheapest in my area) and about ~$1K in other monthly expenses

-a small amount in company stock that I received as part of last year's bonus...I haven't even wanted to look at what it's at now

Since I was pre-approved at the $380K max limit, that's obviously the target area (and lower) I've been looking at with my realtor. I don't have many must-haves when it comes to buying - the biggest obstacle is that after 7 years of living in a ground-floor apartment, I'm insisting on finding a top-floor unit. 

From my own research, it just doesn't seem like I'll be able to put down a quality down payment. I know I'm paying way too much in rent, so I guess I'm at the point where I either need to make the choice to buy, or move far enough away to bulk up my savings for a better down payment.",finance

personalfinance,I have gotten myself into more debt than I can handle and I need help,"**UPDATE:** Not sure if people will still see this, but... I had a conversation with my sister. I told that by the ended of the month, I needed her to prove to me that she had started TRYING to find a job. She threatened to move out, and I said she should. She decided that in a few days, she will be getting in her car and driving several states away to live with her friend from college. So I guess that frees up some expenses to throw at my debt, and very soon I will begin searching for a roommate (with a job). 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to preface this post by saying that I have continuously screwed up financially over the past few years, and I'm ready to make a real change. I'm well aware of how dumb I have been, and I beat myself up about it plenty. I am not here for judgement. I'm here to ask for help.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a lot of debt. I've always been a compulsive shopper. I blamed it as a coping mechanism for anxiety, but working on my anxiety did absolutely nothing for my spending habits. Well, this year, I was diagnosed with ADHD, and since I started treating it, I have been able to manage the shopping more than ever. I've tried to tackle the debt in the past, but for the first time ever, I feel like I have a shot at actual success (eventually). I have now cut up all my credit cards, just in case, so I absolutely cannot ruin this for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Some notes that might be relevant: I live in South Florida. I am active duty military. I am currently fully supporting both myself and my sister (She is my roommate and is unemployed due to the pandemic. Hopefully she will one day get a job and help me, but for now, I have extra expenses).

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a breakdown of my finances:

* The paycheck that I take home is **$4,010** per month. This is after taxes, and after an 8% contribution to the Roth TSP. (Should I lower the percentage and focus on debt first? Is Roth even the right choice?)
* I pay a mortgage of **$1,534.52** per month. The loan is 30 year with an interest rate of 3.375%.
* I pay **$312** per month on my car payments. My parents took out the loan with me as a co-signer, so all I know is that the payments are done in May 2022.
* Utilites: My water bill is around **$120** per month. My electricity bill is about **$180** per month. My internet bill is **$90** per month. (Any tips to reduce these? I am new to house ownership, but the electric bill has seemed like a lot since it's summer in South Florida)
* Other expenses: Gas usually costs me about **$25** per month. Groceries usually cost around **$330** per month. (I don't know how to reduce this, but it is food for 2 adults and it seems like too much) I also pay about **$215** per month for pet-related expenses (I have 3 cats, my sister has a dog and 2 guinea pigs. Of this amount, $117 is for a monthly vet plan that supposedly made it cheaper to get my cats their initial vaccines/neutering but I am absolutely canceling when the contract ends because I was probably ripped off)
* **OVERALL EXPENSES:** $1534.52 + $312 + $120 + $180 + $90 + $25 + $330 + $215 = **$2,806.52**

I just spoke with my leasing company and they gave me a few options ranging from 36-75 months on a finance contract and the interest rate is identical for all of them at 5.49% oddly.  

Total amount financed for each would be around 32,000 given these calculations. I could always put  money down too.

In addition there’s no early payment penalties so once I’m in a better position I can pay this down at any point.  The 75 months SEEMS like the best option for me but I wanted to know what the personal finance team thinks.

personalfinance,How does investing using life insurance work?,"My girlfriend (31) currently pays about $1,600 a month for life insurance. This is split between two companies (Allianz and Nationwide). She was sold these policies through her financial advisor friends. These policies are meant to be investments, but I don't really understand how life insurance works as an investment.

Does investing through life insurance actually make sense? If it does, then why isn't everyone doing it? 

We just got off the phone with the Allianz financial advisor who tried to explain some of it. From what I understand:

 * The money that she spends on insurance is invested by Allianz. Allianz will then beat the market, or at the very least protect her investments from going down. If the market goes down, Allianz eats the loss to keep her account value static. **Is it reasonable to believe that Allianz could beat the market over many years?**
 * She can ""withdraw"" money later by taking out a loan against the policy. While there is a 5% interest rate on the loan, the amount spent on the interest rate is credited to her account. **So is Allianz providing withdrawal with a 0% loan?**
 * This setup of taking out a life insurance policy and then taking out loans against it, instead of just investing directly, is supposed to be more tax efficient. **It seems to me the capital gains that my girlfriend avoids paying by this elaborate setup would just be paid by Allianz, so how is this setup actually helping?**
 * When I asked to compare this to mutual funds, the financial advisor created a table. Though the mutual fund actually did have a higher account value than the Allianz account value by the end, the financial advisor said that more could be withdrawn in retirement from the Allianz account than the mutual fund case. This was because they used the 4% rule for how much can be withdrawn from the mutual fund, but suggested that over twice as much could be withdrawn from the Allianz account. I wasn't sure why you could withdraw more from the Allianz account in the demonstration, but it was explained that because Allianz had better market strategies and protected you from sequence risk it could allow you to withdraw much more. This is the part I understand the least. **How could you withdraw more than the 4% rule suggests if you were to use life insurance?**",finance
personalfinance,Looking for Advice on Car Loan Refinancing,"First off, I would like to preface this by saying I have very little experience when it comes to loans and financing, everything I know is pretty much secondhand knowledge I've gathered from friends and coworkers. I am in the market for buying a vehicle and recently heard a few bits of advice on refinancing that I would like to verify and ask some questions about.

In general, I understand that a dealer will either offer financing at a flat apr or a higher apr with some cash back incentive. My initial thought was that in the long run it makes more sense to take the lower rate because it ends up being cheaper over the length of the loan. However, I've heard it's possible to take one of these cash incentive offers and then refinance the loan through a credit union or bank, effectively financing the rest at a lower interest rate while still taking advantage of the incentive.

My questions about this are:
1. In general, does this actually work? Is this something you would recommend?
2. What is the best way to explore refinancing options? Is it normal to ""shop around"" for better rates at various financial institutions before refinancing?
3.Is there any reasons not to do this such as fees for refinancing, negative impacts on credit score, etc?",finance

The car itself is mechanically sound, mileage is up there (mid 70k, I drive alot), other than that its solid. 

I'll be upfront, it's not a need to get this car. Im feeding into my wants. That said, its the car I wanted when I bought this one but couldn't afford. Here we are three years later and I can make it happen. 

 When I was at the dealership yesterday for a keyfob battery and ended up test driving the one I've been looking at, I fell in love. There's no question, I want this car. 

Now, the numbers. 

These numbers are based on my verbal conversation with the sales rep, so yes, I took this with a grain of salt. They claimed they would pay me what I owe on my car, and with $1000 down, my payment would be at most, $30 more a month. Thats not an issue for me. 

However, I just started a new job this week. My dad (who cosigned on ny current loan since I had no credit) is the king of doom and gloom, and when I discussed this with him kept asking ""if you really want a 6 year payment"", rambles about an economic depression/recession, what would change if Biden was elected (""he may lower the prime rate and lower interest rates to promote spending) etc. 

For me, Im looking at my income and current finances, the change in those monthly, and if this is a stable idea. 

I'm definitely going to sit on this for a few weeks and let the dust settle, but as usual with my dad I'm now worrying about ""what ifs"" and odd possibilities. 

Tl;dr: i want to trade my okay car i didnt want when i bought it for one I actually want/enjoy driving. Preliminary numbers seem to work out, dad thinks the world is falling apart and i should wait a year,  and now I'm scared. Any thoughts?

Edit: thanks for the replies! Some additional information.

Currently living at home, expenses are minimal (thankfully). I usually go to school, but am sitting this semester out due to the covid situation. I would love to move out, but I've looked into it heavily and wont be an option for a while. Housing prices in my area are insane. My current car payment is $296/month, insurance varies but max is $130, phone $55. New job is $18.50/hr plus commission, work full time, but I'm not counting the commissions for the bills, and I'm not getting them yet. Hope this helps, please let me know if theres more that can help.",finance
personalfinance,Single/Higher Income Close To Deduction Limits. Should I Invest In Traditional or Roth IRA?,"I feel like I have my investing very close to being on auto pilot, but I had some lingering questions. Even after reading dozens of posts about tIRA vs. Roth IRA, I'm still confused about what would be best for my situation. 

It is my understanding that below $65,000 MAGI, you can fully deduct your tIRA contributions. Right now, I've been contributing to a Roth IRA for the past 3 years. I max out both my 401K and my HSA so in that case, my income would have to be below $88,050 ($65,000 + $19,500 + $3,550) in order to qualify for full deductions. If that is the case, I am right at the cusp income wise, and may exceed it in 1-2 years depending on raises. If that is the case, is it worth it to contribute to tIRA for the next 2 years and then go back to Roth IRA after? Or should I just stick with Roth IRA for simplicity. At any point, is it worth it to do partial deductions?

Another thing that I am confused about is right now, I am in the 22% federal tax bracket as a single filer. If I am going to be jointly filing as married come retirement, and pursuing FI in which my income / withdrawal will be less than $60,000 and in the 12% federal tax bracket, shouldn't deductions not matter and I should be all in on tIRA? Or am I missing something here? It doesn't make sense to me why you wouldn't go traditional in all accounts if you are higher income and single now and will be married come retirement and planning on retiring early with reasonable spending (between $40,000 - $80,000).

I think I'm just having a lot of analysis paralysis and it will be nice to have this settled and just have everything on auto pilot until the glory days. Thanks for any help!",finance
personalfinance,First Time Home Buying and budgeting,"We are a 28 year old couple currently pre-approved for 385k purchase price. We live in a relatively low cost of living area (Kansas City). We have no debt. We will likely be having a kid in 2-3 years. I currently make $78k and wife makes $46k. We both see a 2% increase per year and I have salary growth potential in my job in the next few years. I also didn’t factor in summer school income that my wife usually chooses to do $2500 after tax. How does our budget look? Are we spending too much on housing? What am I forgetting? 

This is an estimate of what it will look like if we use the full $385k pre-approved amount. We very well might find a cheaper house. 

Take home pay $6830
- this is after retirement contributions (me- 4.5%  matched 100%, wife- 14.5% pension matched 100% but no social security for her school district and a $75 month Roth)

Mortgage estimate $2200
-includes taxes, insurance and pmi
-3.125% interest rate
- area we are looking in has great schools and we plan to stay in our house 10+ years

Utilities $400
- I’m having trouble estimating what they will be. We are looking at houses under 2k sq ft. We pay $150 renting a 1k sq ft apt now 

Groceries $500
-we spend too much here

Eating out $200

Car Insurance $200

Car payment $250
- we own both cars right now but estimating for a purchase in a year or two. Will set aside this amount for the down payment

Extra retirement $300 Roth 
   - about $40k in this account 

Cell phones $150

Internet $70

Healthcare $100
 - out of pocket costs for allergy shots and copays. I work in healthcare, so very low cost plan 

House maintenance $300

Car maintenance and gas - $200
- I’m working from home permanently so this could be less 

Pet Care -$100

Clothing cosmetics hair - $300

Gifts and charity $150

Gym $100 
- canceled currently due to COVID. Might build a home gym now that we have a house 

Fun money/misc - $300
- summer school money will increase this and go towards travel 

Savings - $1000 a month
- we will have about $10k in savings after down payment and closing",finance
personalfinance,Financing a Heating/Cooling System,"First off I hate taking on debt, and I do have the cash on hand to pay for a heating/cooling system outright if needed, but it would come from an emergency fund.  I currently heat my home with electric baseboards and cool with window ac units. I am in the northeast and electricity costs are very high. The proposed new system would be a series of ductless mini-split units with a total cost of approximately $15,000-$16,000. Trailing 12 month electricity cost is approximately $5000. I can attribute approximately $2000-$2500 of this to the electric baseboard, but its much harder to determine the cost for the window ac units. Figures say the mini split would be about 3 times as efficient in the winter and considerably more efficient in the summer. Rough estimated cost savings is $1500-$2000 a year. 

The proposed new units have a warranty of 12 years for parts and 1 year for labor. 

The state offers a rebate of approximately $5000 and I can take advantage of and the clean energy tax credit for an additional $300. So net cost is approximately $10,000. Based on the estimated savings the payback would be 5-7 years depending on how close I am on my quick math, which I tried to be conservative with. 

The state offers a 84 month loan for the purchase of this equipment with a 0% interest rate. So it would be \~$120 a month for the term based on the $10,000 cost. Most likely saving me money every month from day 1. 

I don't have any immediate plans on selling the property, but it may be a possibility in the next 2-4 years to move to a different school district. Do you think that this time of system would add to the resale value of the property? Would you install this heating/cooling system with the possibility of selling in the relatively near future?",finance
solarenergy,"Homes of the Future, Today: Net Zero &amp; High Performance Homes","Hey Redditors

I was asked to post about High Performance &amp; Net Zero Homes from another sub so I figured I’d share some info with this sub as well. I’ve taken the below info from a presentation I recently did at a local college regarding an introduction to green building (residential) so keep in mind, it’s only a portion of the presentation and as well, it has some local context. I’ve omitted the more technical information, as well as the cost analysis since it’s so regionally dependent. Some features and stats related to Net Zero Homes may not necessarily apply to your area in the world. I’d be happy to answer questions as well. 

….

There are different approaches to building a very energy efficient, high performance house. The methods identified here such as Passive House and Net Zero Energy Homes are not mutually exclusive, but do approach design and implementation differently.  The term “high performance home” will be used to describe either approach interchangeably, in order to convey the reduction in energy consumption provided by these methods. 

Passive house, is a German design standard that designs and constructs a house to have very low energy loads. They are very well insulated, airtight, and use solar energy to help heat the home. There are many more technical details in order to ensure the home is very low energy, but that’s the general idea.

Net Zero energy homes are also low energy homes but the standard is less stringent than passive house. They require solar energy to be installed on the home in order to provide enough energy to cover the homes yearly energy consumption. When designing and planning a net zero home, the most important aspect is to increase the efficiency of the home as much as possible, so that your solar system is as small as possible. Energy efficiency is the cheapest form of energy, as it is energy saved. 

There are many other programs that encourage and certify energy efficient homes or healthy homes (I can go into more detail if need be).

In order to plan and design for a high efficiency home, it’s imperative to think of the house as a system. The house as a system concept considers all the parts of the house. This includes the building envelope, the mechanical &amp; electrical systems (furnace, hot water tank, ventilation, air conditioner, lighting &amp; appliances, the indoor &amp; outdoor environment (temperature, humidity, and air pressure) and the people who live in the house. Changing one part of the house can affect other parts of the house. One example of this concept is as we build more air-tight homes, mechanical ventilation is required in order to provide fresh air. This is because air is no longer able to come through the leaks in the building envelope, as it would in an older home. The new home airflow is a balanced system, with equal air coming in, and going out.

\\There are many benefits of to building a high performance home. Some are backed by data, but others are can’t be measured.

First, energy costs are significantly reduced. Maintenance and operational costs associated with low energy consumption are much lower compared to similarly built homes using current construction standards.

An obvious benefit is the low environmental impact of a home with low energy consumption. These homes are constructed with sustainability in mind for both energy use, and water use and are often equipped with water saving features and appliances. The energy saving measures result in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. A net zero home produces clean energy; this is especially important in (my area) as most of our electricity comes from fossil fuels, producing more emissions than other areas who rely on hydroelectric generation or have a more renewable fuel mix. 

High performance homes also provide increased comfort since they are well insulated from temperature fluctuations, which is especially important in my area where temperatures can swing 30° Celsius from one day to the next. As well, there’s less discomfort and cool spots because there is minimal thermal bridging and higher performing windows. This goes for both areas that need to focus on heating needs, as well as warm climates that focus on cooling needs.  

High performance homes are future-proofed. This concept can include features that make it resilient to external factors, as well as changes to the occupants and their lifestyle. High performance homes are durable, constructed with high quality materials to last. The building is more likely to withstand fluctuating temperatures and long-term climatic impact such as extreme heat and severe weather. By installing long-lasting roofing systems, replacement of shingles underneath solar photovoltaic panels will not be needed for decades, in some cases up to 50 years. Future-proofing also means that a home built to the highest efficiencies will not fall behind when building code changes become more stringent, which will increase its market value. 

Solar energy provides future-proofing as it will protect the homeowner from electricity price fluctuations, guaranteeing their purchase price of electricity for the life of the system. 

As mentioned, high performance homes can provide increased market value. They often sell faster than regular homes, with resale prices 4-10% above conventional homes (US &amp; Canadian stats). 

Homes built to higher efficiency standards don’t have to be complicated. In fact, simplicity in both design and operation are key. Initial planning to reduce thermal bridges, such as a reduction of corners, cantilevers, window placement and other considerations can reduce the complexity of the actual construction, while increasing comfort and reducing energy use. Mechanical equipment used to heat the home and hot water are no more difficult to operate than systems already widely used. The building functions well and can use new technology without being overly complicated. Smart home technology can further increase the usability of the home by programming appliances to operate during “free energy” times and setting thermostats to reduce energy consumption. Keep in mind, occupant behaviour has an effect on energy consumption of the home. 

Homes that have renewable energy also provide energy security and sovereignty, especially those with energy storage capabilities. Occupants can feel confident in knowing where and how their energy is produced. As well, if there are black-outs or supply issues, the home can continue to operate as normal during the daytime and production hours, but especially so if equipped with batteries.

Occupant health is increased by introducing a constant supply of fresh, filtered air and exhausting stale, humid air. Toxins, allergens, moisture and odours leave the home, while new air removed of pollen, air pollution and smoke are brought in. Proper ventilation not only provides a healthy indoor environment, but protects the home from structural damage due to moisture.

Further health considerations can include sourcing healthy building materials, but this is not a requirement for passive house or net zero certification programs. 

Additional insulation, air sealing, and triple pane windows also reduce outside noise, resulting in a peaceful, quiet home. 

Lastly, it just feels good. The physical benefits of comfort, peace and health on the occupants is complimented by the knowledge that their home is sustainable, green and eco-friendly.  

We’ve always been passionate about sustainability, self-sufficiency and holistic, practical solutions to environmental problems. When we were looking at alternative home designs as we planned to build our own home, we considered everything from constructing an Earthship to greywater recycling. In the end, we decided to construct our home more conventionally but focusing more on practical application of high efficiency principles using locally sourced materials and expertise. 

We complete our own project in 2018. It was built using the principles of Passive House. It was also topped with solar panels, generating as much energy as it consumes, making it a passive solar, Net Zero Energy (NZE) home. Although it was designed and built using Passive House theory, it did not meet the stringent PH requirements. It can however, it is still considered a great example of a high performance home.

The reduction in energy consumption is achieved through thoughtful design, insulation, thermal mass, high performance windows, increased air tightness, and the elimination of thermal bridges which is areas where heat is transferred to the outside due to less insulation or more framing. Thermal mass is where heat is absorbed, stored, and released slowly from a part of the home.

The home was built with a double-stud wood frame, with 1’ thick walls.  The windows and doors are passive house certified, extremely well insulated, and have been designed to let in as much solar light as possible on the south side. The building envelope is also breathable, in that we used a smart vapour/air barrier to assist moisture in moving through it more effectively to reduce build up and prevent mould and long-term structural damage. We insulated the attic, slab and walls two times what normally would be installed. The house is very airtight and was tested using a blower door test to ensure any leaks were identified and fixed before we drywalled. 

We heat it with electric wall heaters and a wood stove when necessary. We installed a high efficiency heat recovery ventilation system which recovers the heat from exhaust air and transfers it to incoming fresh air, which saves energy by reducing heating loads in the winter. Our hot water tank is a heat pump hot water tank, which is about 350% efficient, and extracts heat energy from the surrounding air and uses it to heat our water. We also installed a drain water heat recovery system, which is a coil of copper tubing that captures heat energy from wastewater and transfers it to the hot water tank to reduce energy needs further. There are three solar systems on the property – one on the roof, one on the ground, and one that powers the water well. The house also has a back up battery system in order to protect the home from outages.

Some additional features of the property related to sustainability include a large garden, fruit forest, chickens, rainwater harvesting and worm composting. 

By conducting site development with conservation in mind, less trees were cut and less land was disturbed than a conventional build may have incurred. We use existing ecosystem services located near the site, such as natural run-off pathways to areas that can manage excess water by absorbing it. Site selection was also important in incorporating as much south facing sunshine as possible for solar PV and passive solar heat gains.

We had three objectives when planning our home. 

The first was energy security and self sufficiency. This was important as we wanted to ensure we were less reliant on the electrical system. Power outages have occurred in the area which the home was constructed and severe weather is predicted to increase due to climate change. In order to withstand the effects, having a hybrid solar PV system that was both grid-tied with battery-based back-up was important to us. The electrical design of the home included allocating certain mechanical, lighting and plumbing features to either the grid-tied, or off-grid systems. If grid electricity were to be inaccessible during low-light times, the back-up solar system and batteries would engage and appliances such as the heaters, HRV, stove, hot water tank and select lights would still work. The wood stove acts as a back-up heat source. As well, having solar energy guarantees our price of electricity over a long period of time as electricity prices continue to rise. 

Another reason why we wanted to design this house is cost savings – Although it had a higher upfront cost, utility cost savings meant that it will be paid back over time. Having low or no utility costs were important to us. In the summer, the solar system generates way more than we consume and we receive credits toward our account. In the winter, we use more energy than we generate, and those credits go toward those energy costs. For this particular project, our payback period was about 20 years. 

Another goal for the project was sustainability. We wanted to both reduce our environmental footprint as much as possible.

By producing more than we consume for energy, this also reduced our greenhouse gas emissions. 

This house is estimated to produce 16 tonnes of CO² annually without solar energy. However, since it produces as much energy as it consumes, the home will mitigate these greenhouse gases and only produce an estimated .204 tonnes per year. The solar energy installed will save the equivalent of 3.5 passenger cars taken off the road for one year, or under 18 thousand pounds of coal burned. If the this house were to be built to minimum code standard, it would generate 34.64 tonnes of GHG emissions per year, which equals 7.4 passenger vehicles on the road in one year, or 37 thousand pounds of coal burned. Over the course of 40 years, the home will save the equivalent emissions equal to that of just under 300 cars off the road. 

Our project  performs 71% better than new homes constructed today, less than the 75% improvement of Passive House. It also performs much than the minimum net zero standard with a 48% savings in annual space heating loads, which is a 15% improvement over the program requirements. The building envelope alone has an 80% improvement over a code constructed home. 

The project will be certified through a local organization as Net Zero. It’s EnerGuide rating is zero – this means that it consumes zero gigajoules over the course of a year because of the production from the solar system

Without solar, it would be a low-energy, high performance home at 46 GJ per year, when a similar home built conventionally would consume about 111 GJ per year for heat and power.  

These types of homes are “homes of the future” and can be constructed today, using local materials and expertise. We are moving toward a low carbon, low energy future and housing is one part of that movement.

personalfinance,Borrowed too much student loans - Looking for the right next step,"Thanks for checking out my post. I assume it helps to know I'm in US.

I set up my student loans for the Fall before I decided to take classes exclusively online. That drastically reduced the cost of tuition leaving me with a substantial amount leftover that would be processed as a refund. I waited too long to adjust the amount before bank distribution. Now it's been distributed as refund, but I don't necessarily need those additional funds if it means I have to pay interest on them later. 

My question is: Do I fill out the form to return the funds directly to FedLoan or should I make a large payment on my current student loans that are set at 0% due to the pandemic? 

I was planning to return it rather than make a payment, but I want to make sure that's the most effective move.

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 7th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 7th, 2020.

# **The stock market shakeout is likely not over yet, even with Friday’s comeback  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/the-stock-market-shakeout-is-likely-not-over-yet-even-with-fridays-comeback.html)**
*****
&gt; The tech wreck is probably not over, despite Friday’s market comeback.
*****
&gt; Analysts expect the shakeout in stocks to continue after the long Labor Day weekend, especially in technology names and the Nasdaq, areas of the market that notched the sharpest gains.
*****
&gt; After August’s 7% gain in the S&amp;P 500, stocks started September strong, and then just as quickly rolled over. The Nasdaq lost 5% Thursday and was down sharply Friday but pared losses to decline 1.5%. The S&amp;P 500 was down about 2.3% for the week, even after a 3.5% loss Thursday.
*****
&gt; “I think this is a good wake-up call and a reminder that there are risks out there,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “In August, we did take a little bit off the table.”
*****
&gt; Analysts expect the week ahead to be busy, with holidays ending and more market pros back at their desks. There is some economic data, most importantly Friday’s consumer price index. The reading on consumer inflation is expected to show little change in core inflation with forecasts for a gain of just 0.2% in August, or 1.6% year over year.
*****
&gt; # Froth blowing off
&gt; The stock sell-off came as market pros were becoming increasingly wary of froth in the market, particularly in tech and momentum names. On Friday, it was revealed that SoftBank was behind billions in large options bets on individual tech stocks, like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla. News reports said the trades were made over the past month, and SoftBank had been building unusually large positions in call options, or those that bet the prices of underlying stocks would rise.
*****
&gt; One analyst said the fact that SoftBank was “gunning the market” makes him worry that there is more selling to come in Nasdaq names. As SoftBank bought call options, the sellers had to buy stocks, conceivably driving up prices in a trading feedback loop.
*****
&gt; “It’s just a trip to the casino,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “If they’re supposed to be an investment company taking a long-term horizon, then trying to juice your short-term return through options, you’ve turned into a hedge fund.”
*****
&gt; JPMorgan strategists said they expect the market to recover gradually, but there are still presidential election uncertainties looming in the next couple of months.
*****
&gt; “The significant reduction in previously extreme long positions in Nasdaq by momentum traders should allow the equity market to recover over the coming weeks, as happened after the June 11th correction,” noted JPMorgan analysts. “But a repeat of the strong gains seen during July and August is less likely over the next two months.”
*****
&gt; Grohowski said there could be more selling in the tech and internet companies, or those that were viewed did well as workers stayed home and the economy was shutdown. “It’s not the start of a big lasting correction, but a forewarning the next couple of weeks and months are going to be choppy. I think it’s going to be a sideways kind of market,” Grohowski said. He added the market could be choppy in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; “We’re a little more cautious, not to mention the market is trading at 23 times our earnings estimates for 2021,” said Grohowski. He said the fact there is about $4.5 trillion in money market funds is a bullish signm since that money could find its way into the stock market.
*****
&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the S&amp;P 500 could dip to its 200-day moving average, or 3,092, before rebounding, which would be about a 15% move in total.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think the sell-off is over. Nasdaq is up 83%s since March 23, the S&amp;P is up 63%,” said Emanuel.

&gt; # Small Caps Best Day After Labor Day

&gt; In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.16% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last eight years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last three years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market’s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.25%. S&amp;P 500 is worst, up only 42.9% of the time with an average gain of 0.13%.

&gt; # Big August: Bullish or Bearish?

&gt; Big August 2020 logged the 4th biggest August percent gain for the S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and the 6th biggest since 1930. But, is this bullish or bearish for the market in the coming months? Hopefully the table below provides some perspective by comparing the previous Top 20 S&amp;P 500 Augusts since 1949 to July, September, Q4 and the succeeding “Best Six Months” November-April.

&gt; Subsequent Septembers were down 15 of 20 years for an average loss of -1.0% (median loss of -0.7%). Q4 is positive with gains in 13 of the 20 years for an average gain of 1.0% (median gain of 3.0%). The following Best Six Months are more bullish, up 16 of the 20 years with an average gain of 7.6% (median gain of 8.5%).

&gt; Looking at just the 7 years that were preceded by big Julys shows some improvement for September but Q4s are worse, containing the largest Q4 losses. Back-to-back big Julys and big Augusts were followed by improved Best Six Months results, up in all 7 instances with a higher average and median gain and the top gain.

&gt; # Analyzing the Jobs Report

&gt; The jobs market remains strong, as the August nonfarm payrolls came in at a solid 1.37 million jobs created, right in line with expectations. This was the fourth consecutive month of gains, up 10.6 million over this time frame. In March and April more than 22 million jobs were lost, so we still aren’t quite to half of the jobs recovered though.

&gt; This was the second consecutive month there was a very weak ADP private payrolls number ahead of the monthly jobs report, adding to the worries, but the actual nonfarm payroll number was once again quite solid. Don’t forget, just yesterday we saw initial jobless claims come in at 881,000, the lowest number since the week ending March 14, another improving employment number.

&gt; The big surprise in today’s report though was the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, from 10.2% last month and an expected 9.8%. This was the lowest unemployment rate since 4.4% in March.

&gt; “This was an impressive report and once again showed the economy remained quite resilient,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But 8% unemployment is 8% unemployment, so let’s not get too excited, but we’ll still take this improving trend in the employment picture.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, even though more than 10 million jobs have been created in the past four months, the sad truth is we are still quite a long way from recovering all the jobs lost due to the pandemic. In fact, looking at previous cycles, it has taken years for all of the lost jobs to come back and this time doesn’t appear any different.

&gt; One thing to consider is could this solid number make it harder for Washington to agree on the next stimulus plan? We are watching this closely, but with the two sides still close to a trillion dollars apart, today’s report will likely do little to help the two sides come to a quick resolution.

&gt; Last, don’t forget that stocks gained more than 60% in less than six months, so some weakness would be perfectly normal. In fact, looking at the two previous strongest starts to a bull market ever (’82 and ’09) both saw some weakness right around now.

&gt; # 3 Charts To Watch If You Are Bullish

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index just closed the door on its best August since 1986, making new all-time highs along the way, while also closing up five months in a row.

&gt; First things first, make no mistake about it; this is a new bull market. That of course doesn’t mean it will last years like previous bull markets, but a nearly 57% gain in 5 months is what we’d classify as a bull market.

&gt; Here are all the bull markets going back to the Great Depression and where this one ranks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Now let’s dig into the 5 month win streak. It is quite rare for stocks to gain from April through August, as the summer months tend to be somewhat tricky. Yet, we found there were six other years that saw these 5 months all close higher and the rest of the year was higher five times, with some solid returns in there. In fact, the only year that was lower the rest of the year was 2018, mainly due to the Fed policy mistake in December 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “What might surprise many investors is 5 month win streaks are actually incredibly bullish going forward,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, a year after a 5 month win streak has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher 25 of the past 26 times.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 Index gained more than 35% during this 5 month win streak, the most ever. Yet, the future gains after 5 month win streaks is very impressive, higher 25 out of 26 times a year later. An object in motion tends to stay in motion and this sure seems to be the case here.

&gt; # Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year

&gt; What a month August has been so far, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 7%, for the best August since 1984. Not to be outdone, this is the first time in history August saw two separate 6-day (or more) win streaks. Last, with one day to go, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16 days so far this month, for the most since 16 in April 2019. Meanwhile, it is the most up days for any August since 2003.

&gt; “Well, 2020 has laughed at many of these things, but be aware September is indeed the worst month of the year on average,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But what caught our attention was both September and October have a negative return during election years, with October the worst month of the year. Could investors get election jitters again in 2020?”

&gt; As show in the LPL Chart of the Day, September tends to be a weak month. In fact, it is the weakest month on average since 1950. Additionally, the last two times August was up more than 5% were 1986 and 2000; the S&amp;P 500 fell 8.5% and 5.4% in September those years.

&gt; Breaking things down by just an election year shows that August actually tends to be strong. That obviously played out this year, but now will the weakness we usually see in September and October play out?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Finally, after today, the S&amp;P 500 will be up 5 consecutive months. Looking at the other years that saw a similar summer rallies, there tended to be more strength the final 4 months of the year, with only the Federal Reserve policy mistake of December 2018 blemishing this impressive track record.

&gt; Yes, this record equity run is extremely stretched, but we would continue to use any pullbacks as an opportunity to add to longer-term core equity holdings, as the economy continues to come back quicker than most expected.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming holiday-shortened trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,Any advice for me? Self employed preparing for first mortgage.,"My wife (29) and I (29) recently paid off our first house - although it's not exactly typical. We bought it on a land contract 5 years ago, and we plan to keep it. It's very tiny, out in a small town in a noisy industrial area. It's safe, cozy (after 5pm and in the winter), but about an hour from our family. Tiny bedrooms, no closets, laundry in the bathroom, no garage, and lots of other inconveniences.

We want to buy a more traditional &amp; bigger house closer to town. We are self employed, and don't have much savings - about $5 grand currently.

Our credit scores are both 795ish. The only debt we have is about $2k on a car (with super tiny payments and low interest rate) and $4k on another car ($200 payments and low interest rate.)

I've taken a bit of unemployment this year, but most weeks don't qualify as I'm still bringing in partial income.

Do you have any advice for me? Would prefer to move out sooner than later, but know that I'll have better odds the longer I wait.",finance
personalfinance,Soliciting Thoughts on Financial Health and Strategy,"Hi there, I’ve been a long-time reader of this page. I love the community here and thought to toss my own stats out to get some input on how I’m doing and what might need to change, if anything.

Recently finished my PhD and back into industry at 32 years old. Love my job, negotiated a good compensation structure for my sub-field, and not actively looking for a ""higher income,"" so don’t plan on leaving unless something really good comes along (which, given the pandemic, won't be anytime soon). Take the following numbers with some grains of salt, though, as I spent the last five years on a PhD stipend of $21k (if you’re wondering about being 32 and having low 401k and Roth balances)

  
Salary - $84k ($7k gross per month)

High-yield savings account balance - $21k (emergency fund)

Checking account balance - $16k

401k balance - $39k

Roth balance - $13k

Managed account balance - $54k (I know we’re at a market peak; it was at $48k this time last year)

&amp;#x200B;

Mortgage - $1,375 per month (just bought a house in January; put 5% down and PMI is about $60 per month) (3.3% interest rate)

Student loans - $5,700 left (5% interest rate)

Car loan - $9k left (original purchase price of $24k with $8k down) (2.95% interest rate)

Never carried a credit card balance; always paid it off in full each month

&amp;#x200B;

\- Company matches 100% of up to 11% of pre-tax income for the 401k, so I put 11% for a total of 22% per month (total of around $18,480 invested per year with both sides' contributions) 

\- I put $100 per month into the Roth IRA (not affiliated with my company); started this when I started my PhD program to keep saving something since I didn't have a full-time salary

\- I haven’t put money into the managed account since I started (and now finished) my PhD; with student loans out of deferment since I graduated, I’ve been focusing on paying that debt down before putting more money into the managed account. Currently strategy is ""moderately aggressive"". Advisor fees are low, and I’m really happy with my broker. While I think there's certainly room for more investment here, not sure if I should put “more” into the market right now instead of just holding onto cash in the checking account. I don’t anticipate a job furlough or loss, but I prefer to play it super safe, if I can. The account's done really well over the past five years I've had it ($36k balance in Sep. 2015 and, with no contributions on my part, sits at $55k in Sep. 2020).

&amp;#x200B;

Average after-tax income per month of $4,350

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Expenses

Mortgage - $1,375

Student loans - $400 (\~14 payments left)

Car loan - $375 (\~25 payments left)

Car insurance - $95 (high car insurance rate state; no accidents)

Utilities - $260 (electric, gas, water, sewer, trash, sewer insurance for old home)

&amp;#x200B;

This leaves me with about $1,800 to play with each month, which includes everything else like groceries, going out (pandemic!), gas, and such.

&amp;#x200B;

On average, I tend to spend about $1,100 per month. I wouldn’t consider myself an extravagant spender; I cook at home most nights and go out once or twice a week since it's warmer; less in winter.  When I started my PhD and because the income was so tight, I implemented a “daily allowance” budget model, which came to be around $20 per day. To fill up the gas tank or go out to dinner, I’d “bank” days so I could stay on budget for the month. Since I finished the PhD, my “daily allowance” is up to $60 per day, but just because it’s there doesn’t mean I’ve spent it (but it’s been so nice to go out a buy a bottle of wine with dinner on occasion; just on occasion!).

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve had, on average, about an extra \~$600 per month since I started the new job. I used two months of that to buy a new washer and dryer and then one month of that to make a single payment of $600 on my student loans (to get them down to the current balance along with monthly payments).

&amp;#x200B;

Questions for the community:

1. How am I doing in general? I have an emergency fund (high-yield savings) of right at about six months of expenses with trimmed monthly spending, which I worked very hard for.

2. Am I saving enough for retirement? Right now, it’s about 23% of my salary with the 401k and Roth contributions.

3. Presently, I’m not actively putting money into my high-yield savings account; I’ve been using the extra \~$600 per month for necessary purchases and progress on student loans. Once those are paid off (\~14 months or so), I plan to set aside that $400 in my savings for unexpected housing and/or car maintenance/repairs, etc. Thoughts on this strategy?

## Month Thirty Two – Down 71%

[2018 Top Ten Summary](https://preview.redd.it/l1qak6kf2dl51.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=802683eefbe1e2fb16e3cec21c53b0e85a900d30)

August was not quite as strong as all-green [July](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-31), but still a solid month for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment. The gains were led by (I hope you’re sitting down for this one) (drum roll please) (you’re not going to believe this): **NEM**(!) which finished the month up over +200%. Really!

## Question of the month:

#### The US Justice Department announced in August that it had seized cryptocurrency from terror groups in the Middle East. How much did they confiscate?

A) $2 million  
B) $4 million  
C) $8 million  
D) $32 million

## Ranking and August Winners and Losers

[Rank since January 2018](https://preview.redd.it/by6d90c13dl51.png?width=411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f5750aa2f2ded9d5fe4916b5f0b4b668355e1fb)

Lots of movement this month: all but three cryptos moved positions in August and all but one (**NEM**!) in the wrong direction. Despite gaining in value, **Dash** had the biggest slide, down four in the rankings from #24 to #28. **ADA** fell three and has dropped back out of the Top Ten. **XRP, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA, and Stellar** each lost one place in the rankings. The lone exception is a big one: **XEM**(!) climbed an unprecedented 9 spots in August. The last time **NEM** was in the Top Twenty was [May 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-seventeen/).

After thirty-two months, 50% of the cryptos that [started 2018 in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out. **NEM, ADA, Dash, IOTA**, and **Stellar** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Tether,** **BSV**, **CRO**, and most recently, **LINK**.

***August Winners*** – [Don’t call it a comeback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vimZj8HW0Kg), **NEM**‘s been here for years. Up over +200% in August, **NEM** crushed the rest of the field. A distant second place was **ETH**, up +32% on the month.

***August Losers*** –  Down -13%, **ADA** was the worst performing crypto of the month, followed by **Bitcoin Cash,** down -9%.

For the overly competitive, below is a tally of the winners of the first 32 months of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment. **Bitcoin** still has the most monthly wins (7). **Cardano** is a close second with 6 monthly wins. Despite its blockbuster August, **NEM** has the most monthly losses with 6. Every crypto has at least one monthly win and **Bitcoin** is unique as the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t lost a month in the 2.5+ years of the Experiment.

[Ws and Ls](https://preview.redd.it/teljel3h3dl51.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16335639c2dddb60a91990cd3fae1475c5022521)

## Overall update – BTC in the lead and inching towards break-even point, followed by second place ETH. NEM escapes last place, replaced by Dash.

Although **BTC** didn’t make any major moves this month, it continued to slowly but surely approach its break-even point. It is down about -10% since my purchase in [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.** The initial investment of $100 thirty-two months ago is now worth about $90.

**Ethereum** is all alone in second place. It had a strong August, it picked up a lot of ground, but is still down -35% since January 2018.

The big story this month is at the bottom: **NEM**(!) gained +200% in August, crushing its counterparts and leaping out of last place, where it was so comfortable for so, so long. Although still down -83% over the life of the experiment, it moved from 10th place to 6th place in just one month. The new king of the basement is **Dash,** down -91%. The initial $100 invested in Dash 32 months ago is now worth $8.50.

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

The crypto market added nearly $43B in August. The last time we saw a similar level in terms of overall crypto market cap was way back in the [fifth month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-five/) of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment: May 2018.

## Bitcoin dominance:

After being stuck in the mid-60s for most of 2020, BitDom dropped significantly this month, down to 57%. For context, the last time BitDom was this low was back in [June 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-eighteen/).

For some more context: since the [beginning of the experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/), the range of **Bitcoin** dominance has been quite wide: we saw a high of 70% BitDom in September 2019 and a low of 33% BitDom in February 2018.

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018:

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio gained about $17 this month. If I cashed out today, the $1000 initial investment would return about $287, down -71% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).

While -71% isn’t something to brag about, the monthly trend is encouraging. Here, take a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, for some context:

[2018 Top Ten Monthly ROI Summary](https://preview.redd.it/zy4lxpds3dl51.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecab4643900dfe90503596666329df4dc4cfde38)

So, -71% from a bottom of [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/) is moving in the right direction. 

Or that’s what I tell myself as I cry myself to sleep nightly. 

Hopefully the next stop will be in the -60% range, a level this experiment hasn’t seen in years.

So the Top Ten Cryptos of 2018 are down -71%. What about the ***2019*** and ***2020*** Top Tens? Let’s take a look:

* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-20): up +82.51% ($1,825)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8): up +82.52% ($1,825)

So overall? Taking the three portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $3000 investment in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, my combined portfolios are worth $‭3,937‬** ($287+ $1,825 +$1,825).

**That’s up about +31%** for the three combined portfolios, compared to +23% [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-31). This marks the highest ROI of the three combined portfolios since I added the metric this year.

Here’s a table to help visualize:

[Combined ROI on $3k over three years](https://preview.redd.it/5ynu1t704dl51.png?width=447&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ad736f75b27b71f76a83d0eccb62b1df76b574c)

A +31% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for three straight years, not bad. But surely you’d do better if you invested only in one crypto, right? Depends on your choice. Let’s take a look:

&amp;#x200B;

[Three year club: shoulda gone with ETH](https://preview.redd.it/eprjbse44dl51.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fc3095025b4df41430a37cb8de8c7d557788748)

Only five cryptos have remained in the Top Ten for all three years: **BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,** and **LTC.** Knowing what we know now, which one would have been best to go all in on, at least at this point in the Experiment? **Ethereum**, easily: the initial $3k would be up +160%, worth over $7800 today. The worst performing at this point is **XRP,** down -17%.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of the experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. Defying global gloom, the S&amp;P 500 reached an all time high in August and is up +31% since the beginning of the Experiment. The initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would have been worth about $1310 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P.

But what if I took the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&amp;P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments? Here are the numbers:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018: +$310
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019: +$400
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020: +$90

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After three $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, and 2020, my portfolio would be worth $3,800.**

That is up over**+27%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/), compared to a **+31%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

That’s a 4% swing ***in favor of the*** [***Top Ten Crypto Portfolios***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/)! As you’ll see in the table below, this is only the second time since I started recording this metric that crypto has outperformed the S&amp;P had I taken a similar investment approach:

&amp;#x200B;

[ 3 x $1k crypto vs. S&amp;P ](https://preview.redd.it/5dfzxluc4dl51.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48a3c0601c2f735a9f7e43e5e3cc3c02b18e51ab)

This is a big turnaround from the 22% difference in favor of the S&amp;P just [two months ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-30). 

Although it’s fun to see crypto is in the lead, I’ll leave it to you to decide whether the heart condition you may develop by being in the cryptosphere is worth that +4% edge…

## Conclusion:

August was a bit mixed compared to July, but still a very solid month for the 2018 Top Ten. Some interesting developments this month: **Bitcoin** is now within 10% of the price I paid on January 1st, 2018. **ETH** had solid gains and **NEM**(!) had a crazy month, tripling in value and finally climbing out of the basement. At the same time, traditional markets are doing well too: the S&amp;P reached an all time high in August. It will be interesting to see how both markets perform during the final third of a very crazy year.

Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.

## And the Answer is…

**A) $2 million**

personalfinance,what is reporting directly?,"I got a credit card from my local credit union some time ago to try to build credit history (has like an 8% interest rate too, much better than other cards i got at like 24%) and the credit union mentioned that they report to all 3 credit bureaus but only report directly to one of the 3.

i tried asking what it meant that they report directly to one but still report to all 3 and after kind of giving some round about answer that didnt say much the person at the credit union admitted that they are not sure exactly what the difference was and was not able to find me an answer then as well.

so what is the difference if my credit union reports directly to one of the three bureaus but all three still end up with the info? does that affect my different credit scores in any way? or change what they put on my report?",finance
personalfinance,Need advice: Parents want to use my credit to lease a car?,"Hi everyone, 

I (21) am looking to get advice and see if there are any potential downsides or things for me to be aware of in my situation, since I'm relatively inexperienced with this kind of thing. 

My parents are currently looking to lease a car, and unfortunately their credit scores are not good, so they are asking if they can use my credit/have me as the signer and them as a co-signer, since they say the interest rates will be lower. They said they'd get 8-10%, but with my credit, they could probably get a 2-3% rate, and as a student could possibly get a discount. I have really only paid for groceries and gas with credit, and I always pay it immediately, so my credit is fine

They should be able to make consistent payments on the car. I'm just not sure if this could potentially have any repercussions on me, or if there's anything I should be aware of if I were to sign?

Edit: Thank you everyone that posted! After hearing literally everyone say not to do it, I will definitely NOT be signing for them and it almost seems silly that I even considered it! You guys are all awesome for your advice!",finance

Quick info: married, $132k in student loan debt, graduating soon, starting a job before graduating

1. Should my wife and I file separately so her income doesn't impact my payment amount? We'll be at about $140-150k combined and I don't want her income to be a part of the calculation.
2. Since I'm starting a job before graduating, do my loan payments start immediately or after graduating? Finishing a PhD, and this and next semester will be my first semesters not full time.
3. Also because I'm starting a job before graduating, assuming my payments don't start immediately, do I still get the 6 month deferment period or will it start right after graduating?

personalfinance,Unfreezing credit for a job application or keeping it frozen because my info was leaked?,"Ok so I'm in an unlucky situation right now. I was laid off from my job last week and a couple days later, my personal information was leaked (name, DOB, SSN). I've made a police report, told my bank, checked my credit and promptly froze it through the big 3 (Equifax, transunion, and Experian) as well as chexsystems 

Thankfully nothing has been opened in my name but I'm still unemployed and need a job. I've been applying to different positions but fedex in particular says that they check my credit when reviewing my application without saying which agency they use. 

I really want to keep my credit secure but I'm not sure when or if FedEx or some other company will look at my credit. I'm skeptical of the idea that they will take the time to notify me of a background check rather than just throwing rejecting it

I've seen people say that they unfroze their credit for a month for background checks (mostly when talking about security clearances). Also saying that the employer will come to you and say that you need to unfreeze your credit. But like I said, I'm applying to low level jobs and I'm not sure if they would want to extend the effort.

Bitcoin,Why hasn't the main function of Bitcoin gone mainstream yet?,"Let me preface by saying this is not meant to be criticism or hate towards Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, etc. I've invested thousands in Bitcoin in the past, HODLed like you wouldn't believe through its massive ups and downs, and bought/sold it multiple times along with other cryptos. I see its potential as a legitimate currency, or rather I did.

But therein lies the issue I've been struggling with. To my understanding, the main function of a currency is to spend it and use it to purchase things and to pay bills. Bitcoin, a CURRENCY, is surely intended for such uses as well, as are other crypto*currencies* across the market. Therefore, why has this function not gone mainstream with Bitcoin yet? Why aren't that many people using cryptos to actually spend it on things, which is literally the purpose of any currency? And if that isn't their main purpose, why are they called currencies?

It just seems like a very tiny percentage of people who own Bitcoin actually spend it on things, and even less do so regularly. It seems the vast majority of people who purchase it simply do so with the intention to sell it later at a higher price or to add value to their investment portfolio. This is perfectly fine, of course, but that can't possibly be the main function of Bitcoin if it's meant to be a currency, something meant to be SPENT on things.

Then there's the argument that not enough people are familiar with Bitcoin...that argument just doesn't hold anymore, especially with its value having peaked (so far) at $20K in late 2017 and continuing above 11,000 until just recently. Pretty much everyone and their grandma has heard of Bitcoin at this point and knows what it is. There's also the issue of not many major online retailers currently accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment, like Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Target, Apple etc. and they drive the vast majority of eCommerce.

My guess is its value is too volatile and unstable for people to treat it the same way they treat their actual money (USD, etc.). It seems its fluctuating value has dwarfed its true purpose; since its value is so unsteady, people see it as having potential to increase a return on their investment if they later sell it for a profit. So they'd rather just do that than to actually spend it on a new pair of shoes or something. Plus, say what you will about the diminishing value of the US dollar, but it seems it'll be far more stable than the Bitcoin will be in the foreseeable future, possibly ever.

And my last point is something I've wondered since I first even heard of Bitcoin. Regular government-appointed currencies like the US dollar are already pretty much digital anyway, since people buy things online and know how to send payments digitally and load them on their PayPal account or send them through online venders like Square Cash, Venmo, Chase QuickPay etc. So isn't that way too hard for cryptocurrencies to compete with, since that is far too mainstream and established and people trust it too much already?

Yes I'm aware of the benefits crypto has over regular currencies like USD, but as it stands now, those benefits seem to be outweighed by its volatility that make its intended purpose far less lucrative. Again, please don't interpret this as hating on Bitcoin, but merely an attempt to understand it. I just don't see that many people treating it as anything other than a stock, which is not at all the same thing as a currency. Feel free to change my mind.

TL DR: If the main function of Bitcoin is to spend it, why doesn't anyone really use it for that intended purpose?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Credit: Fisco score unavailable after 6 months without account,"Thanks in advance for any advice.

Up until a few weeks ago I lived in Japan, for about decade. During my time there, I periodically used my US credit card to build/maintain credit so when I moved back to the states it would be a smooth transition. Unfortunately, late last year, I misplaced my wallet and had to cancel my credit cards. My credit card/bank company reissued a new card, but I later found out it was undeliverable (US postman refused to deliver my mail to my parents' address, even though my mail had been delivered there for years.) and therefore canceled.  I received zero notice of the credit card cancellation. 

Fast forward a few months to April 2020 when I'm preparing to move back to the US, I confirmed with my parents that my credit card hadn't arrived. I reached out to my bank and they finally told me what had happened and that I had to re-apply for a new credit card. I did this and was declined immediately. My credit card company said my credit had been frozen, so I reached out to Experian and was told that wasn't the case. My card company however wouldn't issue me a new card. At this time the U.S. was going crazy with covid and many agencies were under staffed and incapable of dealing with out-of-the-ordinary cases. I thought it would be less of a hassle to deal with this once I moved back to the states and things calmed down.

I came back early August and the first thing I did was visit my bank/creditor, they recommended reapplying for a credit card. I did and got denied, again. I was told my credit was too low. I then checked my credit score on Experian, it said my score was unavailable due to an inactive account for 6 months.  I'm not sure what this means for my credit in the long run. I had a 720 fico score in February of this year. I tried to ask a person at Experian how to resolve this and what it meant for my credit but had trouble understanding their English.

I've asked my bank to make an exception and reissue my credit card, but I have little faith they will help me. 

So this left me with a few questions:

1. How will my credit be affected in the long run?
2.  Will opening a new credit card instantly  restore my credit?
3.  Do I have any recourse against my creditor or experian? There was clearly something on their end that caused me to be denied in April.(I have excellent payment history- never missed payment or incurred a late fee.

TLDR version. Lived abroad. Lost my credit card and so the card got canceled. Screwy times caused screwy credit reports. 720 fico score but couldn't get new card. 6 months later I tried to get new credit card but fico score unavailable due to inactivity.",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth it to invest in a decently expensive condo with my father?,"Hello PF! I posted this a few days ago, but didn't have enough information to get strong answers. I now have a lot more info on what my situation is so here goes.


So when I began college in 2017, instead of paying college board, or renting off campus, my father invested in a condo in a very popular city on the west coast.  I'm now paying part of the mortgage as rent since I've graduated, but am going to be moving out to move somewhere cheaper/split a studio with my girlfriend.


The deal is that my father put 20% down on a 300,000$ condo in 2017. Interest rate was for an investment home at 5.25% for 30 years. 
Now that I have a job, and interest rates are low, we are thinking of refinancing and putting my name on the lease. Hopefully getting a home owners interest rate since I'll be here for a few more months (somewhere between 2.6-3%), on a 15 yr loan. I'll also be putting more money down, somewhere between 40-60k. Probably 60. Mainly this is to increase equity and get the monthly payment down and be able to make positive cash flow with tenants.


The monthly payment chart is here(HOA means the HOA fees):

Left align | Center align | Right align
:--|:--:|--:
ADDED | M PAYMENT | +HOA 
0 | 1505 | 1885
10,000 | 1438 | 1818
20,000 | 1372 | 1752
30,000 | 1305 | 1685
40,000 | 1238 | 1618
50,000 | 1171 | 1551
60,000 | 1104 | 1484
70,000 | 1037 | 1767


I currently have about 110k in stocks, 10k in a roth, 8k in a HISA, and 20k in cash. I'd plan to liquidate stocks before the end of the month to get the 60k. 


What I've assumed is we can rent anywhere from 1750-1900. We are currently vetting tenants for 1890, and hopefully that will work out. This looked like I could get a 5.3-8.1% return on the money renting it out for this much. But since it's a joint investment, the return will be cut in half between pop and I, so more like 2.7-4%.


Closing costs will likely be around 6k to refinance and the unit isn't brand new or anything, so there's likely going to be some intermittent repairs.


A few other things to consider is that I really like the city that the condo is in, so if I ever wanted to move back to the area, that could be an option.
There are two parking units associated with my unit, where I think parking is super valuable here. 

The condo community is super welcoming and nice.
We aren't downtown or anything, but there have been car breakins in our lot on occasion. 


I can't think of anything else at the moment but am happy to answer questions.


The over-arching question is does this seem like a good opportunity to get in to real estate? and a worth-while investment? After the 15 year loan is up, and we have full equity, there could be regular cash flow from tenants - the HOA fees. Plus, a place to stay in the city n case we ever have vacancies.

personalfinance,Long term capital gains brackets question,"Hi all, I sold a bunch of stock this year that I've held for a very long time (over 10 years). I'm preparing now for the taxes I'll have to pay on it and have some questions. I'm sure I'll find out for sure at tax time, but this way I can prepare for what I'll have to pay now and set that aside. 

I read that the 0% federal long term capital gains tax bracket goes up to 40k or so. Since I read the brackets only affect the tax on the money at that portion of income, is it legal to claim long term capital gain income into that tax bracket, then start counting my employee income tax bracket starting at 40k? So even if it causes me to pay more in taxes on my employment income, it'd be less on on the long term capital gains, and less overall than if I counted capital gains at the end.

One other question, I'm pretty sure long term capital gains don't have any kind of special treatment with state (AZ) taxes and now since I basically doubled my income and haven't taken out any taxes on it, I'll have an underpayment penalty if I don't do something now, is this correct? Is it pretty easy to pay early to avoid this?",finance

personalfinance,"I bought a car, and then this happened. Help?","So I bought a car, or so I thought. It's really quite funny. Originally I bought a car from Carvana, only for them to wreck it on the date of delivery. Yes, you read that right, they wrecked it. They then refused to change the price on the car, at all. I decided buying a car sight unseen was not a good idea for me.

So off I went on a daylong journey to find a new ride. My truck is perfectly good but I work 30 miles away, and it is a good idea to get something a little more predictably reliable. I do a massive search online for specific cars I'm interested in, and then go and look at them, ignoring salesmen left and right, trying to objectively think about the large purchase and weigh my options.

 The first dealership I went to was ford, and it was the one I ended up buying a car from. It's a lovely car. Optioned out with an affordable payment and lower than expected interest rate, but higher than expected insurance payment. The compromise being it is a plug in hybrid, it gets 100mpg.

I left the dealership on the 27th, with the impression that I owned the car and I was financed through Wells Fargo. I left with an envelope they prepared for me, that was supposed to have all of my copies of the financing paperwork and all of the other car buying paperwork.

I got a call on the 3rd fords financing guy, saying that the bank has declined the loan after reviewing my paystub. I get paid for a full day of work if I finish early at my job, but on my stubs it shows my hourly pay and actual hours worked, along with a bonus for finishing early equaling the remainder of hours that I would have worked if I did not finish early. The bank doesn't recognize over a third of my income as consistent.

This has left me confused, and surprised. So he asks if I have a cosigner, or if I would like to change my financing agreement, doubling my interest rate. I busted out laughing, and then he told me to send him my latest pay stub so he could fight with the bank. And then he ran my credit an additional 6 times, with 6 other banks. I believe that I was spot delivered a car. I was never approved, and the reason I know I wasn't is because after going through the paperwork from the envelope that was prepared for me, there is not a single paper relevant to financing EXCEPT one saying I was declined..

What exactly are my options here? Can I just give the car back? I live in Georgia if that's pertinent information. Thanks reddit!",finance
personalfinance,New RV Loan Dropped Credit 22 points,"We recently purchased a travel trailer and are also in the middle of refinancing our house to a lower interest rate.

personalfinance,I am about to receive a sizeable financial gift. I need help figuring out the best use for the funds.,"As the title says, my husband and I each received a $15,000 gift. My husband and I keep pretty separate finances. (we each have our own accounts and then have a joint account for the mortgage and house-related payments) The $15,000 is mine to spend/ save/ invest as I see fit. 

I am currently unemployed, but see myself being employed by November.  I am receiving unemployment and our monthly joint income/ spending is at a point where after basics (mortgage, food, his vehicle, student loan payments, etc) we have about $1,000 leftover for fun money/ saving. 

We have a mortgage that is only at 10% equity meaning we pay PMI. It would take about 30k to get it to 20% and knock off PMI. PMI payments are $160 per month. We are planning on refinancing the home after a decent size kitchen remodel and hoping to find more equity and lower monthly payments. Current mortgage payment is $1,900 with PMI and escrow. 

I have one private student loan that has a balance of $12,000 and an interest rate of 5.5%. The monthly payment is $200. 

I have a federal student loan that has a balance of $91,500 and an interest rate of 5%. financed for 30 years, monthly payment is $550- currently not paying this loan as I am unemployed and it is not gaining interest. 

I have limited retirement savings and need to increase my retirement savings. ($1,000 in a Roth IRA; $5k in a IRA- rolled over 401k from my previous employer) I am 30 if that matters for retirement planning purposes. 

For full disclosure, my husband has a car loan for $10,000. He pays about $800 per month on the loan. (more than double the monthly minimum because he wants to pay off the loan ASAP) He has about $150k in retirement savings and about 30k in nonretirement investments. He is also 30. 

We are financing the kitchen remodel at 0% for 12 months (our appliances are 0% for 24 months). our monthly payment for the remodel will be about $600. 

Here are my current thoughts as to how to spend the money; 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Max out my Roth IRA for 2020, use the rest to pay down my private student loan. I would have about $3000 left on the private student loan and could pay it off in about 6 months after I start working again. 
2. Completely pay off my private student loan and put 3k in my Roth IRA. 
3. Keep the cash in my bank account until I am employed again in case something major happens and I don't find a job in my expected timeline. 
4. Invest the cash in an easily accessible investment account so it gets a higher rate of return than in my savings account, but I can access it if I do not find employment. 
5. Use my husband and my cash to get our house to 20% and cut PMI from our mortgage payments. 
6. Use my cash to pay for the remodel so we don't have monthly payments.",finance

economy,Several thoughts about the US economic model,"Why US are the biggest and the richest economy in the world, and have so many social problems and deep inequality?

First – why it is the biggest and the richest? At fist look it seems US have better economics model than the other countries. But I do not think this is the case. US have unique location and history. They are protected from the competition by two oceans at east and west side. At north Canada because of the climate cannot support big enough population to be a competitor, and at south Mexico is a typical subtropical country, where is easier to develop the agriculture, and the industry struggles.

As history – the viruses brought by the Europeans killed most the native population: nobody really knows how many millions died. That freed an enormous area of land and resources.

The result is a period of peace without a precedent in the human history. Since the Civil war there was not a major conflict on the US continental soil. So more than 150 years without forced destruction of the economy. Meanwhile every other big country with temperate climate was destroyed multiple times by wars. I think this is in general the secret of the US wealth.

Now let look at the present. How the US economy works, and why generates so much debt. Since the WW2, because of the stability – no wars, and the market – the only big economy that was not destroyed by the war, US dollar became the world’s reserve currency.

So now Fed counts on that to print money. Then the private banks and the federal government take that money and give most to private companies – that means private profits, bonuses and buybacks of shares. This is not a bad model in general. But in US it has several big issues.

Many social services are privatized. And that makes them very expensive – as the price includes the private profits, bonuses and buybacks of shares. That creates whole private sectors in the economy that lay on the federal money. And if we add the constant attempt for growth of the private companies, that leads to debt spiral.

There is a paradox – if the US minimize the share of the private sector in the social services, so they increase the federal spending, the overall cost will be reduced significantly.

The lack of adequate social services and protection is the main reason why the inequality leads to conflicts and confrontation. Also that situation effectively suppresses and limits the opportunities for the poor, so their children also become poor and etc. And that strengthens the inequality through the generations.",finance

personalfinance,What's the best way to approach these student loans?,"Hey all. I'm trying to figure out the best possible way to approach these student loans. For reference, I recently graduated professional school with quite a large sum of loans. My wife and I make ~$170k combined. Currently putting $2k towards loans per month and would like to keep that amount static while we use the rest of our income to build e-fund, contribute to retirement, etc. In 4 years, our combined income should effectively triple so I can be more aggressive then. For now, here's what we're dealing with.

Loan summary:

Federal - $324,000 @ 6.65%. These are currently in forbearance due to CARES and are at 0% interest until Jan 1, 2020. After that, interest will be approximately $1900 per month. Until July 1, 2020, government is paying 50% of that amount for me, so effectively the payment will be $950 per month.

Private loans:

$12,900 @ 7.75%

$16,500 @ 5.5%

Currently, I've been throwing $2k per month at the 7.75% loan since it's the highest interest rate and then plan to move on to the 5.5% private one until July 1 since the government paying half of the federal loan interest essentially makes the effective rate ~3.3% until then.

Do you all think this is the proper approach? Just work my way down from high to low interest? My concern is that the federal loan, even though they have a lower effective rate currently, will continue to balloon up sheerly due to the size of the principal. I do currently have $12k I can throw in a huge lump sum to knock out the 7.75% loan and try to get rid of all private loans by July 1 so that I can just focus on the federal and possibly even refinance it next year.

Hope this all makes sense. Anyone have any thoughts here? It feels like no matter what I do, I'll be stuck with large payments for the next few years but want to be smart about the approach. Thanks in advance!",finance

Bitcoin,Stop measuring your wallet size in USD and start measuring in terms of REAL ASSETS,"I've been considering the recent posts regarding Schiff's definition of real money, the Fed and the Founding Father's definition.  Bitcoin, gold and silver meet the standard, while the USD barely scrapes by.  

What does the USD have that Bitcoin doesn't?  We denominate the real economy in USD.

The USD is backed by the biggest economy in the world.  Goods, services, assets, commodities, real estate, precious metals and even crypto are all denominated in USD.

Stop measuring your wallet size in USD - start measuring it in Wheat futures, oil Futures, Gold and Silver.   

Therefore, what we ultimately need is a new 'COMEX', a new 'NYSE' - one that is denominated in Bitcoin. 

Essentially we can put this into practice ourselves by denoting our crypto profits in REAL ASSETS - when crypto goes up against any of those REAL ASSETS (NOT USD), take profit and buy gold, silver or commodity futures.  Whenever Bitcoin is weak against real assets, sell your futures and buy crypto. 

A practical way to do this is to use  [https://www.dailyfx.com/bitcoin](https://www.dailyfx.com/bitcoin) charts - eg type XAGUSD/BTCUSD into the symbol field to see the current ratio of Silver/Bitcoin.   This article talks about how to trade ratios and ratio trends:  [https://www.dailyfx.com/gold-price/trading-the-gold-silver-ratio.html](https://www.dailyfx.com/gold-price/trading-the-gold-silver-ratio.html) 

In addition I strongly recommend accumulating *physical bullion -* we don't know what will happen to our futures when the economy collapses - but if all the crypto holders have real bullion, we will have the means to rebuild a real economy to back our digital assets. 

I've been stacking both crypto and silver since the start of the year, and patting myself on the back for it.  Now I'm learning to trade Bitcoin off real assets to accumulate both.   Ultimately I'd like to see someone start an exchange denominated in Bitcoin - but it is already possible to do something like that via a CFD exchange - just take your signals from dailyfx.com",cryptocurrency

Student Loan Balance: 177k, sitting at a fixed 6.08% interest rate. All of my loans are federal loans, so I can always pay a fixed amount of my gross income (I understand that this will not be the quickest way to repay, but it is a nice option to have).

Mandatory student loan payment will be $0/month for 2021 (little to no income my last year of law school). Obviously I want to at least put enough money down to balance out the interest.

Rent: 1k/ month

Gym: $320/year

Utilities: $100/month

Car Payment: $233/month; total payoff around 3k

Car Insurance: $65/month

Spotify: $11/month

Groceries: Moving in with a significant other, need to figure out what this number will actually look like

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Relevant Information** (let me know if I forgot anything)

Only investing I have done is putting $15/week into Acorns. Was sitting around 1k, but took it all out to cover the expenses due to the bar exam delay.

I don't need to start paying my loans until 1/2021 (loans put on hold due to the pandemic).

I think I want to set up emergency funds and then work on tackling the gigantic loan, just not sure where to start.

personalfinance,VA IRRRL offers flooding in,"I closed on my house back in February. When I first applied for my VA loan my credit wasn't great, so my initial interest rate is somewhere around 4%. It's improved greatly since then with old marks falling off and credit accounts being paid. Since early August I've been getting VA IRRRL offers from a dozen different mortgage companies to refinance for a lower interest rate, some claiming ""as low as 1.5% with no payments until December"" (which is obviously a scam).

Is VA IRRRL actually useful? Would I be saving any more going with a VA IRRRL vs. a standard refinance? Is six months too early or should I have refinanced long ago? Any recommendations on banks or mortgage companies to refinance through?",finance

We as AzureADA SPO watch all the videos by Charles Hoskinson. These videos are not only great news on Cardano development and ecosystem, but very often a source of inspiration. The video with the name “Rough Days” streamed live on September 4, 2020 is really a historical speech, that’s why we decided to transcribe for everyone who prefers to read rather than to watch and listen. 

The video you can watch here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM192wAV4LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM192wAV4LA)

And here is the text version.

Hi everybody

Charles Hoskinson here live from warm sunny Colorado. Always warm, always sunny, sometimes Colorado. And I got my Massey Ferguson hat on. Take that off, see my hair's all messed up. One of these days and we'll lose all that hair. 

It’s a rough day today and that markets are terrible. down 20 percent for most people. And every now and then I talk about price, I rarely do, but in general, let's talk about the macro.

Crypto is a unique phenomenon, it's a unique thing and these are crazy times. I remember just a few months back when coronavirus first came out and we saw basically everything just bottom out, everybody went crazy they went to cash all asset classes just went to hell in a handbasket. And I did a video and I said: «Guys, our best days are ahead of us as an ecosystem and as an industry. And what happened? Everything got better over time. People started getting more optimistic. You know, the reality is that we are seeing an old industry die right now, the legacy financial system.

I just read Biden's tax plan. He wants to treat capital gains as ordinary income and put another 12,5% on top of that. And at the end of the day, all these new taxes amount to a trillion or so extra dollars, I think, per year in income. Takes six years from the make back what they printed out of thin air for coronavirus and are willing to print again. Which begs the question why do we even pay taxes anymore if we can just print money out of thin air.  And we have a whole movement of people, the AOC crowd, wake up every day and they say: «Modern monetary theory: the actual supply doesn't matter. All that matters is how much can we print and get away with it.""

This is where we're at as an economy right now. And globally speaking, a lot of other nations agree with this. So given that the whole world, the leadership of the world is talking about negative interest rates, they’re talking about predatory financial systems hyperinflation, just print money modern monetary theory, just print as much cash as you want. And we look to the cryptocurrency industry and, God, we got a lot of problems. 

I think this collapse is probably because one of the most prominent exchanges in South Korea got hit.  They got shut down by the South Korean government. They, at one time, were responsible for a big part of the kimchi premium.  And you know what? Korean government might shut down a few more Korean exchanges. And usually the market base these things in. We got crazy yield farming weird stuff going on in the DeFi space. All these other local events and their blips, they don't really matter that much. Just like corona in the long term won’t matter too much.  In terms of the markets what matters is the trend and where are we going.

I had a meeting with some people this morning and we talked about revolutionizing the healthcare industry and getting things better in terms of supply chains. I had another meeting with a soon-to-be former Wyoming state representative about how we're going to get governments to adopt blockchain technology. I talk every day to governors, heads of states congressmen, senators, mayors, some cities, sometimes very large cities with millions of people. They all say the same thing: «We need help, we need solutions, we’re damn tired of the way that the old system is running». And you know what? If we don't solve it - a lot of people are going to get hurt or continue to be hurt. The common theme that we all have is - no one's happy.

Look at the black lives matters protests. Taking their philosophy of the organization aside

the ranking file people are there not because they love marxism they're there because they're unhappy with the way society is. And why shouldn't they be?

When my grandfather got his first job on my mom's side out of the Korean war, he was a lineman. And he made enough money from that job to have seven kids and have his wife stay at home. No college degree fresh out of high school, fresh out of marine demolitions and alignment five boys and two girls. And he could take care of that family and save money every month, have a car and a house and that was his standard of living. How many people in the middle-class today in the United States or Europe for that matter have the ability on a single person’s salary to raise seven children and have the wife or the husband stay at home? 

How many people? Not many.  Why? Because our monetary system has failed us. The inflationary policy has created a situation where the Jeff Bezos can have 200 billion dollars and make windfall profits every year regardless of how bad the economy is and the everyday people they don't get a pay increase, so a lot of cases they don't get keep their job and their money deteriorates in value a lot more than three 3% per year. 

Our industry has principles in that we worship the math and the protocols and the stable monetary policy, these types of things. And as corrupt as some of the exchanges can be and some of the bad actors are: all movements suffer from these warts. And they're finite and temporary. You run out of them at some point. Self-regulation kicks in or standards kick in and these bad actors flush out. And what's left behind is a crucible that contains the truth of the matter, which is: **we're going to win as an industry**. 

There's just no doubt in my mind. You have bad days in the market, you have damn good days in the market. You get addicted to the good ones and you hate the bad ones but at the end of the day, it's only going in one direction which is: **crypto is going to eat the world**. 

Every voting system, every property registration system, every monetary system the next 25 to 50 years is going to be running on the tech we build and others build. And running with the principles of **power to the edges**. This is the great challenge of our time: to do it in a way that it's fair, transparent, open, and doesn't allow a government to co-opt it. It's gonna be a lot of fights here the least of our concerns and matters are a red day. And every now and then I like making these videos to remind people why I’m here and why you should be here too. As toxic as the trolls could be and these other people can be - none of them really matter. Markets don’t really matter. What matters are the principles and the purpose behind what we do. And you have to ask yourself: - Are you happy with the way that society is? Are you happy with the money in your pocket? Are you happy with the political leadership representing your nations? Are you happy with your future and do you honestly believe if we keep doing the things that we did and continue to do that the future is going to be better? Or do you think it's going to be worse or stagnant?

I think too many people have woken up and they realize that if we continue doing the things that we do, the future is going to be a bad place. And they don't want that to happen. And so we're voting with our wallets, we’re voting with our feet and we as a collective industry are waking up and figuring out how to build something better. And there's some good days and bad days along the way. Today's a bad one, but there are going to be good days tomorrow. Just like I told you back when corona made everything go into free fall. And I told you before. And I warned you about with ICO mania. We're in a DeFi bubble right now. There’s no doubt in my mind about that. I saw it in 2017 with ICO mania, I see it here. And there's probably going to be worse days ahead in that respect. But the trend is always the same and never forget that. And never forget that real people are actually adopting these systems and using them. And every day we see more and more and every day that movement grows.

What's so humbling is that I know a lot of you are here with me. It used to be pretty lonely space to be in a few years back. You know, the conferences, they didn't have many people. My first bitcoin meetup group in 2011 in Colorado is at the gypsy house cafe, I think I was 13th in Pearl over Capitol hill in Denver. And I registered for the event, I showed up. Two people registered: myself and another

guy. And the other guy didn't show up so I had coffee with myself. Compare that with the Shelley summit that we had in July of 2020: 10 000 attendees. Ten thousands from all across the world. Compare that to where we are at today just nine years later. Pretty amazing if you think about how fast things have grown and how many fertile beautiful ideas exist in this industry and what this industry is doing for the world as a whole.  And that is why we're going to win. Because at the end of the day who can argue against freedom?  Who can argue against liberty? Who can argue against putting people in control? The only way you can is when you believe people are stupid, people are evil, people are incapable. And I suppose that's a philosophical difference between those who currently lead and the people who want to replace them. 

The people in charge right now of the world, the big banks, the Fortune 500 companies, the media, Hollywood, these things - they're very cynical people who believe in the worst in us. They look at everyday people with sustain and disgust and say: «These people if left to their own devices will be chaos. These people if left to govern themselves will burn everything to the ground and destroy everything.». And every single time I have ever seen a bad event happen, what the news doesn’t show you and what those people don't talk about is how we come together and help each other out. Someone gets injured in the streets more often than not people show up and help them. People need a helping hand someone always shows up more often than not. And this is no different.

I don't believe the political process is effective anymore in any modern democracy. They've all been co-opted, perhaps they always were. But what I do believe is that we can come together and change things economically, which is what we're doing. And it's messy. Building our own money is messy, building our own industry is messy. We make a lot of mistakes along the way, we lose a lot along the way. We collect some scars too while we're at it. But progress every year keeps being made. The technology every year keeps getting better.  

Today, right here, right now provably secure proof of stake protocols are in circulation.  They were a fantasy five years ago, now they're a fact of life.

Today, right here, right now snarks have evolved by an order of magnitude in every category from validation time to efficiency to proof size. In all favorable ways which opens up all kinds of new applications and scalability and privacy. 

Today, right here, right now layer 2 protocols are more advanced than they have ever been in our industry's history. giving us the ability to build payment systems that scale to billions of people. 

Today, right here, right now we are seeing massive innovations in governance and a fertile environment for things like approval voting, threshold voting, preference voting, quadratic voting that will enable us to build all kinds of new treasuries and governance systems that eventually will scale to nation-states.

As the politicians of today argue whether the post office can properly count paper ballots that people mail, we are building voting systems with state-of-the-art cryptography living on phones where you can vote with just a tap of a button and enjoy more security than we have ever imagined before. 

That is the future. This movement is enabling humanity. Money flowing at the speed of thought and the speed of thought making new money.

How can you compete with that? You can’t, unless you bring people down with cynicism and disdain. And ultimately what competing vision do they offer? That you all should be in chains. 

That we should just be wage slaves. We should just accept that every year our money deteriorates in value. That we should just accept that the rich will get richer the poor get poorer. And every now and then they throw us table scraps. And when we get real angry - they usurp the movements and then install their own leadership to basically take those movements from us. As we've seen so many times before and we will see it again.

I'm sorry that's not a road I want to walk down. And I'm willing to ride rocky waters, crazy markets crazy people in unlimited flood and trolling. But I will never apologize for believing in the best in people. And I will never apologize for believing that if only we give everyone around us the tools to save themselves and society that they can do it. They don't need great leaders and charisma. No one needs someone to tell them what to do. We all know what to do. We all know how to make the world a better place. We just have to be trusted enough to do it ourselves. 

You know what? For the first time ever we did with Bitcoin. And then we did it again with Ethereum. And now we're doing it again with Cardano. And we, as a movement, will continue to do it.

So I believe our best days are ahead of us and every day I wake up and there's more people marching with me in that respect. And one day it'll be millions. And one day it'll be billions. And one day all those cynics will be gone. Replaced with optimists who once again believe that tomorrow is going to be better than today. and that we're going to leave the world just a little bit better than the way we found it. 

So every now and then on a tough day I like making a little message and letting you guys all know it's going to be better and you know what it will be. Just have to have faith that it will be. So hold the line, hold strong, and have faith in each other and go do something. Build something. Start something. Got a lot of podcasts on the way. A lot of things coming down the pipe for the DC fund. A lot of opportunities to actually innovate. Multi-assets are coming soon. Plutus is coming soon. Guys are going to be able to build a lot.

Start thinking today what's the business plan. What would you like to change? Small or large. You don't complain about voting - change voting! Your own organization. Maybe you belong to a club - do a blockchain-based voting system. Maybe you have some political influence. Have a primary democrat or republican or your local primary in your country for selecting candidates done with blockchain-based voting. Maybe you want to build a new financial product. Think about it! Figure it out! There's so much there! It’s all there! It's ready to go, it's for you to take and build and innovate with. 

Every day I wake up I try to make the platforms better. I try to push the technology a little further along. I try to hire great people and bring them into our industry. Cardano brought the Haskell industry into the cryptocurrency space. Cardano brought a lot of academics, who had never thought about cryptocurrencies, into the cryptocurrency space and we made our problems their problems and as a consequence, they started solving them in ways we could have never done before. 

But most importantly Cardano brought a lot of **YOU** into the cryptocurrency space and you never thought you'd have this level of control and freedom over the fabric of society in the direction of the human race.  Don't let that slip through your fingers. Figure out what you want to do with that superpower. Might be small, might be big. I dreamed big. You can dream big too. Even if you want to just dream small: every person counts every action counts. Up to the hill. Y'all matter. To me and to each other and we're all in this together. Never forget that. So, hard day, rough day. Tomorrow will be a better one. The day after will even be better.

See you guys soon

I have a private loan for 17.500 at a high 9's interest, and then federal loans summing 20.000 ranging between 3.76 and 4.66 percent interest.


thats a total of 37.500 in loans.


I dont have great credit score, only 760. annual income in the mid $40k's.

personalfinance,How do I best approach using company unpaid leave AND new Massachusetts PFML program?,"My SO and I are expecting a baby in the fall. We live in MA, and a new law was passed a little over a year ago for paid family medical leave. This is a state program, that I pay into, and have been paying into since July 2019 (as all other MA employees are).

I have contacted the MA state department and they informed me I am eligible to apply for my 12 weeks PFML for the birth of a new child, but the law doesn’t take effect until January 2021. Seeing as this is a new law, and we are having our child 3 months before the law fully takes effect, they are allowing eligible workers (me) to use the benefit within 1 calendar year of the event (in this case, the birth). Great, I plan on using that benefit in January. 

Now, my employer also has an internal company leave policy of 8 weeks unpaid. I plan on exhausting all of my accrued PTO first, but would like to tap into some of the unpaid leave as well. My boss has been very helpful and doing the most he can to get me a straight answer, but he has had trouble finding one. Paychex, our PEO, has been useless, they don’t understand this new law at all and have admitted as much. 

My bosses understanding is the following. He thinks I can use my companies unpaid leave time, up to 8 weeks, but only concurrently, not consecutively with the PFML. Meaning, for every week I use of the unpaid leave, that’s 1 less week I am allowed to use of the MA PFML. The reason he believes this is because our employee handbook states “the company leave policy can be used concurrently, but not consecutively with FMLA.” BUT, FMLA, is not the same as this new PFML law, and our handbook doesn’t address this new law at all. FMLA is also unpaid; just federally protected time off without fear of job loss, whereas PFML is paid by the state, funded by workers like me..

I think I should be able to use as much of the 8 weeks unpaid leave my company offers AND my PFML come 2021. But he doesn’t think so. I just want to make sure I’m taking advantage of the rights afforded to me as both an employee of my company, and as a tax payer paying into the PFML program. 

I really appreciate any resources, advice, experience in this area, it’s been SO hard to get answers from anyone!",finance
Bitcoin,So this in how I think the price of Bitcoin is going to play out,"Disclaimer: I'm not a certified financial advisor. You should not take this as an financial advice. Please make your own due diligence by doing your own research before making any investment.

History has shown in any major economic crisis, there are 5 stages that will happen leading to the apocalypse (Hyperinflation).

**Stage 1 -  Steady inflation**

**Stage 2 - Deep Deflation**

 **Stage 3 -  Higher Inflation**

**Stage 4 - Deeper Deflation**

**Stage 5 - Hyperinflation**

So, we have completed stage 1 &amp; 2 this year and we are currently at **stage 3**, and slowly moving to **stage 4**

So, my prediction is we could go to **stage 4 (deeper deflation)** if the government didn't release the second stimulus package which is against the Federal reserve target of 2% inflation.  But, from what I'm reading on the news the second stimulus package might be released by the end of September if agreed by the government. This will drive Bitcoin price higher and cause us to be in stage 3 for a little bit longer until end of this year.

Start the year 2021, we might face the inevitable **stage 4 (the deeper deflation**), BTC price will drop hard and worse than this week because the real economy isn't going back to normal, no jobs, no food and no shelter. People will start to liquidate BTC assets to support their daily life needs and they will cut their spending because free money from government has stopped

And by 2021, The deflation had become so bad the government had to make the old money printer once again go brrrrrrrrr to stop the economy from collapsing. And that my fellow Hodlers, will be the start of the **Stage 5 (Hyperinflation)**.

When hyperinflation happen, the one who hold real money Gold, silver and Bitcoin and hard producing assets will be safe. The one who don't will be wiped out.

personalfinance,"Large one-time income influx, how to attack debt possibly by investing it?","So I’ve found myself in an interesting financial situation.

I am about to receive approximately $90k in a one-time taxable income situation. This will put me likely at the top end of the 24% tax bracket.

I currently have $60k in student loans (tax deductible interest) and $10k in credit card debt from some recent life situations. 

I am trying to determine what my best course of action is. 

The first is dealing with the tax associated with the $90k. After some research, I am thinking about buying solar for my home. I’ll receive a sizable tax credit and because my s-corporation will actually make that purchase, I’ll have 100% depreciation this year.  Essentially the purchase of solar will offset the taxes and I’d rather make a purchase like this to forever eliminate my electric bill and fuel a future plug-in car purchase than write the check to Uncle Sam.

My dilemma is what to do with the remaining \~$68k.  I could pay off the CC and student loan debt, but the money would be forever gone. I’m open to other ideas. While I have good CC interest rates, they’re still higher than nearly any investment can expect to make, especially heading into election time and unknown political/economic results. However the interest rates on the student loans range from 4ish to 6.5%. I’m sure there are options with a greater yield that would allow me to invest much of this money to slowly pay down the student loans.

I have $100k equity in my home and could obtain a HELOC at 2.99% for 24 months then prime +0.25%. I could take out a HELOC to pay the loans off then invest the $68k to pay off the HELOC.

personalfinance,Getting a second car loan a month after getting a first one. Would it be dumb to apply?,"Hi there, my (26F) wife (27F) and I applied for a loan and got a new prius prime a month ago for a little less that 25k (The reason we bought new is because we were eligible for $8500 worth of tax credits and rebates). That was the first car loan we ever applied for. Before that we had a 2007 subaru outback that we planned on keeping for a long time, however unknown to us the mechanic who changed out timing belt 2 years ago damaged the gears resulting in us having an almost dead car a little more than a month ago. Basically we had to cut our losses and get a new car. We have good credit (Wife's is 820, mines closer to 755) , so we applied for a loan at a credit union and was accepted for 25k for 72 months at 2.74% interest rate. 

Now here's the issue, I've been wanting a second car (that being a Mazda Miata) for a while, but I haven't been serious about it until the last couple months. I didn't think it would be an issue to get financing for an under 10k one with no other car payment, but now we have a car loan that I didn't foresee getting, and now our DTI ratio is much higher. I make a decent income ($82,000) so I'm not worried about affording a second car loan, but I'm not sure if my credit union will see it that way. My plan also is to leave my wife's credit out of this and just apply with mine, as this car is more for me than anything. 

My wife is currently unemployed (but is currently studying to go into the tech field), but is planning on looking for work within the next year, so we're currently living off my income. We have no kids, no mortgage, and no credit card debt. However we do both have student loan debt.

Our finances:

My salary: $82,000

Rent: $1400

My student loan payment: $130

Her student loan payment: $300 (We're both on graduated plans and each owe around $22,000, though because of the covid forbearance, we're just saving up that money)

Toyota Prius loan: $374

I do want to say from a practical standpoint I don't actually need this car right now. We don't actually need another car until my wife gets a job (I work remote right now cause of covid), I have just been wanting this car for a while and was already about to pull the trigger on it before the Prius.

My plan is to talk to my credit union tomorrow about it but I wanted to get reddit's opinion first.

I moved to Georgia last year from New Jersey and had a pension with the State of NJ since I was a municipal employee. I'm now also a municipal employee in Georgia.

I'm trying to purchase my first home in Georgia sometime in early 2021, and when I was online looking to withdraw the pension (more on that in a bit), I was shocked to see that I could use up to $10,000 on a first-time home purchase. Sweet.

But how do you actually do that? I don't want to pull the money out and owe taxes (of course!). The tax levy is 20% Federal and a 10% Early Withdrawal Fee.

What do I do?","TL;DR I have $9k of high interest debt, got approved for a card with a really good deal of 0% APR on balance transfers for 18mo, but the limit on that card is only $1800. I have to make the balance transfer within 4 months in order for it to be 0% interest. 

Full info:

I feel really really dumb right now. I have ~$9k of credit card debt on one card that has an insanely high interest rate. I wracked up the debt over the course of the last four years by using it for expenses when I was underemployed and had no savings (mistake #1), and by making rash impulse purchases of shit I don’t need. 

Now, I have a steady income that’s barely enough to cover my expenses, but tackling the debt has felt impossible because:
* my entire first paycheck goes to rent and bills and is drained by the 4th or 5th of the month, and I don’t get paid again until the 15th, therefore having to use my credit card for groceries and gas until then
* the interest payments are getting up to around $120/m. I can only afford to pay off $500/m, so after new charges and interest, that’s only about $200 that I’m “paying off”, it’s going at a snails pace and truly killing me. 

So, just yesterday, I decided I was sick of this and would take the risk of doing a balance transfer to a card with 0% APR on balance transfers AND purchases for 18mo. Perfect, I thought, I can pay off the $500/m and make it thru the whole amount before the introductory period turns out. 

Well, of course it was too good to be true, because I got approved but my limit is only $1800. Like an idiot, I didn’t realize I didn’t have to take the offer, clicked thru the form in a panicked daze and now.... I have this stupid worthless card in my name. 

So... now what? Do I transfer SOME of the balance to the new card and risk the credit hit for maxing it out? Do I use the new card for purchases so I can stop adding to the high interest debt? 

Thanks in advance everyone &amp; sorry for the long post. I feel drained as all hell and I just want to get out from under this ominous cloud of my own mistakes haunting me at every freakin’ turn, lol.",finance

We try our best to not spend too much in other places, but have not really budgeted too tightly for personal purchases or the rare moments we have gone out in the past 6 months. Some months we went way overboard and got groceries AND takeout a few nights a week.

I don't have a direct question about anything, but I just want to take a temperature check and see how we're doing. Since I've started paying more aggressively on that private loan, I've been a bit scattershot on how I fund my emergency fund. We both have solid jobs, even during COVID, and feel good about our emergency savings but would probably feel better at 12 months+ (which isn't too far around the corner).  We don't find ourselves living paycheck to paycheck anymore, and have been successful in paying off our credit card debts and a few small loans over the past year and half, and I'm super proud of the savings I have done seeing as I was always a spender. 

I drive myself a little crazy checking and calculating constantly, maybe we need something like YNAB to tie things up a bit more? I feel like I broke myself, in a good way, and don't suddenly splurge hundreds of dollars on guitar gear or computer parts. I can't bring myself to spend too much.

Forex,Former investment bank FX trader: News trading and second order thinking part 2/2,"Thanks for all the upvotes and comments on the previous pieces:

* [Risk management parts 1,2,3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/ia5f37/former_investment_bank_fx_trader_some_thoughts/)
* [News trading part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/ijbrsi/former_investment_bank_fx_trader_news_trading_and/)

From the first half of the news trading note we learned some ways to estimate what is priced in by the market. We learned that we are trading any gap in market expectations rather than the result itself. A good result when the market expected a *fantastic* result is disappointing! We also looked at second order thinking. After all that, I hope the reaction of prices to events is starting to make more sense to you.

&amp;#x200B;

[Before you understand the core concepts of pricing in and second order thinking, price reactions to events can seem mystifying at times](https://preview.redd.it/vr7br9y3orl51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c66fc14a8e67bea019db7161b316ce727497ea7)

We'll add one thought-provoking quote. Keynes (that rare economist who also managed institutional money) offered this analogy. He compared selecting investments to a beauty contest in which newspaper readers would write in with their votes and win a prize if their votes most closely matched the six most popularly selected women across all readers:

*It is not a case of choosing those (faces) which, to the best of one’s judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those which average opinions genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.*

Trading is no different. You are trying to anticipate how other traders will react to news and how that will move prices. Perhaps you disagree with their reaction. Still, if you can anticipate what it will be you would be sensible to act upon it. Don't forget: meanwhile they are also trying to anticipate what you and everyone else will do.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part II**

* Preparing for quantitative and qualitative releases
* Data surprise index
* Using recent events to predict future reactions
* Buy the rumour, sell the fact
* The trimming position effect
* Reversals
* Some key FX releases

&amp;#x200B;

# Preparing for quantitative and qualitative releases

The majority of releases are quantitative. All that means is there’s some number. Like unemployment figures or GDP.

Historic results provide interesting context. We are looking below the Australian unemployment rate which is released monthly. If you plot it out a few years back you can spot a clear trend, which got massively reversed. Knowing this trend gives you additional information when the figure is released. In the same way prices can trend so do economic data.

&amp;#x200B;

[A great resource that's totally free to use](https://preview.redd.it/occhvsj9orl51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85b8a20cfa41022cce2977774d922ba06b765760)

This makes sense: if for example things are getting steadily better in the economy you’d expect to see unemployment steadily going down.

Knowing the trend and how much noise there is in the data gives you an informational edge over lazy traders. 

For example, when we see the spike above 6% on the above you’d instantly know it was crazy and a huge trading opportunity since a) the fluctuations month on month are normally tiny and b) it is a huge reversal of the long-term trend. 

Would all the other AUDUSD traders know and react proportionately? If not and yet they still trade, their laziness may be an opportunity for more informed traders to make some money. 

[Tradingeconomics.com](https://www.tradingeconomics.com/) offers really high quality analysis. You can see all the major indicators for each country. Clicking them brings up their history as well as an explanation of what they show.

For example, here’s German Consumer Confidence.

&amp;#x200B;

[Helpful context](https://preview.redd.it/s0nwetqgorl51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5609783ef4bad34ff362ef739e13b895c00554ee)

There are also qualitative events. Normally these are speeches by Central Bankers. 

There are whole blogs dedicated to closely reading such texts and looking for subtle changes in direction or opinion on the economy. Stuff like how often does the phrase ""in a good place"" come up when the Chair of the Fed speaks. It is pretty dry stuff. Yet these are leading indicators of how each member may vote to set interest rates. [Ed Yardeni](https://www.yardeni.com/) is the go-to guy on central banks.

# 

# Data surprise index

The other thing you might look at is something investment banks produce for their customers. A data surprise index. I am not sure if these are available in retail land - there's no reason they shouldn't be but the economic calendars online are very basic.

You’ll remember we talked about data not being good or bad of itself but good or bad *relative* to what was expected. These indices measure this difference.

If results are consistently better than analysts expect then you’ll see a positive number. If they are consistently worse than analysts expect a negative number. You can see they tend to swing from positive to negative.

&amp;#x200B;

[Mean reversion at its best! Data surprise indices measure how much better or worse data came in vs forecast](https://preview.redd.it/ttwclueiorl51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9d6d50dfebb2c43c7f5ff8b8f5e55ef03a311c9)

There are many theories for this but in general people consider that analysts herd around the consensus. They are scared to be outliers and look ‘wrong’ or ‘stupid’ so they instead place estimates close to the pack of their peers. 

When economic conditions change they may therefore be slow to update. When they are wrong consistently - say too bearish - they eventually flip the other way and become too bullish.

These charts can be interesting to give you an idea of how the recent data releases have been versus market expectations. You may try to spot the turning points in macroeconomic data that drive long term currency prices and trends.

&amp;#x200B;

# Using recent events to predict future reactions

The market reaction function is the most important thing on an economic calendar in many ways. It means: what will happen to the price if the data is better or worse than the market expects?

That seems easy to answer but it is not. 

Consider the example of consumer confidence we had earlier.

* Many times the market will shrug and ignore it.
* But when the economic recovery is predicated on a strong consumer it may move markets a lot.

Or consider the S&amp;P index of US stocks (Wall Street).

* If you get good economic data that beats analyst estimates surely it should go up? Well, sometimes that is certainly the case.
* But good economic data might result in the US Central Bank raising interest rates. Raising interest rates will generally make the stock market go down! 

So better than expected data could make the S&amp;P go up (“the economy is great”) or down (“the Fed is more likely to raise rates”). It depends. The market can interpret the same data totally differently at different times.

One clue is to look at what happened to the price of risk assets at the last event.

For example, let’s say we looked at unemployment and it came in a lot worse than forecast last month. What happened to the S&amp;P back then?

&amp;#x200B;

[2&amp;#37; drop last time on a 'worse than expected' number ... so it it is 'better than expected' best guess is we rally 2&amp;#37; higher](https://preview.redd.it/p8iomqujorl51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e68473fd719a5c96293ed9688f5c7482d2ea02a0)

So this tells us that - at least for our most recent event - the S&amp;P moved 2% lower on a far worse than expected number. This gives us some guidance as to what it might do next time and the direction. Bad number = lower S&amp;P. For a huge surprise 2% is the size of move we’d expect.

Again - this is a real limitation of online calendars. They should show next to the historic results (expected/actual) the reaction of various instruments.

# 

# Buy the rumour, sell the fact

A final example of an unpredictable reaction relates to the old rule of ‘Buy the rumour, sell the fact.’ This captures the tendency for markets to anticipate events and then reverse when they occur. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Buy the rumour, sell the fact](https://preview.redd.it/xqlq7v2lorl51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2668b4da44a570325d9713186c05e7123d1ba162)

In short: people take profit and close their positions when what they expected to happen is confirmed.

So we have to decide which driver is most important to the market at any point in time. You obviously cannot ask every participant. The best way to do it is to look at what happened recently. Look at the price action during recent releases and you will get a feel for how much the market moves and in which direction.  

## 

## Trimming or taking off positions

One thing to note is that events sometimes give smart participants information about positioning. This is because many traders take off or reduce positions ahead of big news events for risk management purposes.

Imagine we see GBPUSD rises in the hour before GDP release. That probably indicates the market is short and has taken off / flattened its positions. 

&amp;#x200B;

[The price action before an event can tell you about speculative positioning](https://preview.redd.it/7z14f59morl51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da5b41950bb6eccb2294d9cf03a33ee1b72b0a65)

If GDP is merely in line with expectations those same people are likely to add back their positions. They avoided a potential banana skin. This is why sometimes the market moves on an event that seemingly was bang on consensus.

But you have learned something. The speculative market is short and may prove vulnerable to a squeeze.

# 

# Two kinds of reversals

Fairly often you’ll see the market move in one direction on a release then turn around and go the other way.

These are known as reversals. Traders will often ‘fade’ a move, meaning bet against it and expect it to reverse.

## Logical reversals

Sometimes this happens when the data looks good at first glance but the details don’t support it. 

For example, say the headline is very bullish on German manufacturing numbers but then a minute later it becomes clear the company who releases the data has changed methodology or believes the number is driven by a one-off event. Or maybe the headline number is positive but buried in the detail there is a very negative revision to previous numbers.

Fading the initial spike is one way to trade news. Try looking at what the price action is one minute after the event and thirty minutes afterwards on historic releases.

## Crazy reversals

&amp;#x200B;

[Some reversals don't make sense](https://preview.redd.it/b0lsxo8porl51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5012075ddd00785aa9b1544793c02eee06668464)

Sometimes a reversal happens for seemingly no fundamental reason. Say you get clearly positive news that is better than anyone expects. There are no caveats to the positive number. Yet the price briefly spikes up and  then falls hard. What on earth?

This is a pure supply and demand thing. Even on bullish news the market cannot sustain a rally. The market is telling you it wants to sell this asset. Try not to get in its way.

# 

# Some key releases

As we have already discussed, different releases are important at different times. However, we’ll look at some consistently important ones in this final section. 

## Interest rates decisions

These can sometimes be unscheduled. However, normally the decisions are announced monthly. The exact process varies for each central bank. Typically there’s a headline decision e.g. maintain 0.75% rate. 

You may also see “minutes” of the meeting in which the decision was reached and a vote tally e.g. 7 for maintain, 2 for lower rates. These are always top-tier data releases and have capacity to move the currency a lot.

A hawkish central bank (higher rates) will tend to move a currency higher whilst a dovish central bank (lower rates) will tend to move a currency lower.

[A central banker speaking is always a big event](https://preview.redd.it/t11i91nnorl51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd090dc269979da1fa191d41d57f77630f9c2cce)

## Non farm payrolls

These are released once per month. This is another top-tier release that will move all USD pairs as well as equities.

There are three numbers:

* The headline number of jobs created (bigger is better)
* The unemployment rate (smaller is better)
* Average hourly earnings (depends)

Bear in mind these headline numbers are often off by around 75,000. If a report comes in +/- 25,000 of the forecast, that is probably a non event. 

In general a positive response should move the USD higher but check recent price action.

Other countries each have their own unemployment data releases but this is the single most important release.

## Surveys

There are various types of surveys: consumer confidence; house price expectations; purchasing managers index etc.

Each one basically asks a group of people if they expect to make more purchases or activity in their area of expertise to rise. There are so many we won’t go into each one here. 

A really useful tool is the tradingeconomics.com economic indicators for each country. You can see all the major indicators and an explanation of each plus the historic results. 

## GDP

Gross Domestic Product is another big release. It is a measure of how much a country’s economy is growing. 

In general the market focuses more on ‘advance’ GDP forecasts more than ‘final’ numbers, which are often released at the same time. 

This is because the final figures are accurate but by the time they come around the market has already seen all the inputs. The advance figure tends to be less accurate but incorporates new information that the market may not have known before the release.

In general a strong GDP number is good for the domestic currency.

## Inflation

Countries tend to release measures of inflation (increase in prices) each month. These releases are important mainly because they may influence the future decisions of the central bank, when setting the interest rate.

See the FX fundamentals section for more details.

## Industrial data

Things like factory orders or or inventory levels. These can provide a leading indicator of the strength of the economy.

These numbers can be extremely volatile. This is because a one-off large order can drive the numbers well outside usual levels.

Pay careful attention to previous releases so you have a sense of how noisy each release is and what kind of moves might be expected.

# Comments

Often there is really good stuff in the comments/replies. Check out 'squitstoomuch' for some excellent observations on why some news sources are noisy but early (think: Twitter, ZeroHedge). The Softbank story is a good recent example: was in ZeroHedge a day before the FT but the market moved on the FT. Also an interesting comment on mistakes, which definitely happen on breaking news, and can cause massive reversals.

Relevant info:

Husband (31) and I (27) created a budget loosely following the 50/30/20 plan. We own a house ($255k, 15% down, 3.25% interest rate) and are around $200k in debt - student loans (public &amp; private), no other debts. We’ve done no retirement planning and we have $9k in savings specifically for our emergency fund (in a high yield savings account) (covers 3 months). He’s also in grad school currently. This will cost us $10k but after the program in 3 years, he’ll be making $40k+/year. We do Ally bank and Brio direct, he has one credit card, but we’d like to switch to at least one bank we can go to in person. Probably a credit union.

So for the flowchart, we’re looking at the yellow/green/red sections. My husband is eligible for a 3% 403(b) match - he works in a hospital. I’m eligible for a 401(k), 403(b), 457(b) and/or a pension plan. I work for a school district in N.C. 

My husband had a few high interest loans but we’ve worked hard to pay those off. These are [our loans](https://imgur.com/gallery/CkXD0ak) that are over 4.66%.

Our public loans are on hold till the end of the year which gives us about $1100 extra a month. The $1100 is unaccounted for in our budget right now.

So what do we do from here? I know my husband should contribute to his 403(b) but how much and should I contribute to mine? Or should we just contribute to his and pay down medium-ish interest loans?

We only have just over 20% equity in the loan based on the original sales price. **My question is, is there a loan type that will allow us to borrow on the speculative home value of a completed remodel?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Our logic: 

This is sort of a real life ""Love it or List it"" discussion in our mind. We would like to upgrade to a larger house with a garage and more storage, but if we move in one direction home prices sky rocket(800K+, if we move in the other direction we are outside the area we like. Even moving out of the city, what we want would cost around 400K-500K. Other then the mortgage, we have zero debt and are comfortable with our retirement and education plans for the kids and could afford the 400-500K house, we just don't want to add that distance to our commutes. So can we just pay the difference we would pay for a new house into the current one and make it just as good? I

&amp;#x200B;

More details: 

* Original price : 250K
* Current loan balance 190K
* Expected remodel budget 150K-175K
* Tax assessor value 270K
* My best guess on actual current market value 345K

And to pre answer a few questions: 

* Wife bought the house before I meet her, so it's got PMI and a nice high interest rate on it, we want to decide this remodel question before we refinance. The good news is we both have 800+ credit scores now and very stable jobs.
* New house value would be on the high end of the area, but not off the charts.
* We don't want to dip into emergency savings to fund the project so we can't fund the entire thing.

personalfinance,"Should I pay home refinance closing costs up front, or bundle them into my loan?","Title says it all. I’m refinancing my home from an existing 30 year fixed @ 3.375% down to a 30 year fixed @ 2.875% in Vermont. 

I have the option of bundling the closing costs (about $4000) into the new loan or paying those costs off up front in cash. 

This question may be more philosophical than mathematical. My monthly payments will be $120 less if I pay the $4000 up front, versus only $100 less if I bundle the $4000 in. Obviously if I bundle the costs in, my total principal goes up by $4000, but I’m still saving $100 less in mortgage payments each month. The interest rate doesn’t change either way.

personalfinance,"Completely confused and lost on how to invest $50,000","Hi!

I've worked my ass off and managed to save up over $50,000--I wanted to either buy a house (not going to happen any time immediately soon) with that money and invest some of it to start a business within the next year or so (a fitness studio or a marketing agency in the next year or so, but I am waiting on the world to calm down first)...but I'm not sure where to start. I do not want to invest in stocks, I have been advised several times to not bother and personally I've always felt they were too risky or volatile. Just not something I am comfortable doing.

I looked at CD accounts but I don't think any of them yield an interest rate worth it, the most I've found was like 2.2% and that would only get me like $500 at the end of two years. I just think it's not worth it, esp to have your money tied up for so long. And you can't even put money into it. Similar thing with savings acconts, I just dont think its worth it.

I've been told to look into IRAs but I'm overwhelmed trying to decide which one is the best for me. I also don't really get how you ""max"" out one and can you take money out of it if you need to? is there a term length? Where do I start and how do I gather the right information?

Being I am 27, with so much money i think it is best time to put some money into a retirement savings account as well. I have been told time and time again I can get excellent rates because I am so young. Is that true and again where do I start?

And also, how much should I put in? I have been squirreling away half of my monthly income to my savings, which is at least $1.5k a month.

Youtube videos/channels totally welcome. I am completely overwhelmed on where to start and don't want to make a stupid decision that makes me lose out or ties up my money for way too long",finance

However, since she doesn't work I'm guessing I will have to have my credit checked in any case. My score today is 710. Back to this in a moment.   


I also have a 6 year old collections request that is with Hunter Warfield, resulting from a broken lease. It is currently about $1800. I can afford to pay it. I am interested in negotiating a settlement so they will cease reporting it to the credit agencies, however I am afraid of what my exposure is since I'm almost to the 7 year mark, in regards to the statute of limitations.   


Is it worth the hassle to try and get this cleared up, or should I just let it ride another year then try and refinance then?  


On the refinancing, if I proceed this year, I'm guessing the bank will want to see that collection paid, at a minimum. I'm not sure how it would go just leaving it out there unpaid, but I'm guessing I would not look like a good risk.

investing,Bonds vs Gold,"Hello, i came across an interesting macro thesis by Steven Ban Metre. He states that Bonds will become the better short term investment as they represent the safest revenue generating asset class and he sees interest rates going negative in the near future. He is betting on a dollar rally caused by a run on the dollar to purchase US bonds and a deflationary environment. He then predicts a tentative raise of interest yields to stem the bond run (because it is counter productive when trying to stimulate the economy) causing a massive selloff of bonds, then the interest rates would be brought back down. Combined to economic stimulus packages it would be pushing gold to new highs.

personalfinance,Jumbo vs Conventional Loan Interest Rate and Down Payment Amount,"Looking at a house that’s a little over $1M. We are currently being quoted at 3.125% for a 30yr jumbo loan with 20% down (200k) from our primary lender. Our backup lender is saying that if we put 25% down (250k), it would get us out of jumbo territory and he could get us a rate of 2.5% on a conventional loan.

Does it make sense to pony up the extra down payment to get a rate that’s lower by 0.625%? With some napkin math, the payment lowers by ~$470/mo. That would mean almost 9 years to recoup the $50k.

We could make it happen, but it’s also nice to have the 50k in cash for potential renovations, unexpected repairs, new furniture, etc. The extra 50k wouldn’t deplete our cash savings, but I’m not sure if the lower rate is worth it if it takes 9 years to break even. Would greatly appreciate any additional input from you folks. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,More money and debt than ever,"I racked up around 22k in debt over 4 credit cards over the last 7 years. It's something I'm ashamed of, and something I have been working on. Most of it was accumulated while I was living out of my car, a raging alcoholic, and paying medical bills with a credit card because I didn't know what to do and was scared after threats from collections/creditors.

I've been slowly knocking debt off and was down to about 18k after a year and a half or so of living off rice and beans. I've been unemployed since March due to Covid and have been delaying my minimum which has racked me 2k or so back up (I'm realizing how bad a deal this is and it's the first time I've seen high these high interest rates are killing me). I have 2 cards around 21% interest with 7k on them, and 2 around 15% with 3k. One of the 7k is a business account so it's not currently effecting my credit even though it is maxed out, my credit score is 705 last time I checked.

I was delaying payments with hope that I'd find a steady job or get back to work but that doesn't seem to be a realistic option right now. I work as a server in Los Angeles and the city is still shut down, I also have somewhere around 3-5k of passive income a year from acting residuals. Before Covid I was making around 15k acting a year and 15k serving, but now I'm making $308 a week on unemployment, and any residual I get just cuts into that. I moved in with my girlfriend this month and knocked my rent down from $850 to $450, plus utilities. Then I pay $45 in car insurance, $40 in a phone bill, but my minimum payment on the cards is somewhere north of $600 a month.

I saved and invested the stimulus money from unemployment and just got back my tax refund and have racked up around 16k in my bank account, which is more than I've ever had. I feel like I can begin to pay these cards off and get myself debt free, but I also have no idea when I will be back to work (I am immunocompromised and my workplace is currently being investigated by OSHA due to operating without an HVAC system, so even if LA does open up I don't know what will happen). Basically I want to deal with this situation like a responsible adult so I can move on with my life, propose to my girlfriend (I don't want to burden her with my financial situation even though she is well aware), and cut up my credit cards forever. My real concern is I have no security or real income right now, so I feel I need to leave myself some type of safety net, and not put myself in a dangerous month ot month circumstance that could end up with me homeless again (I'm 5 years sober now though, so at least that's dealt with).

personalfinance,Trying to decide if fixer upper situation is possible for me,"I'm in a bit of a pickle in terms of deciding between buying a fixer upper (that I currently rent) or paying more money for a nicer house in the area we want to be in.

I'm currently renting a home that is in an unincorporated county in Alabama. I have a verbal agreement to buy the house for $235k and the landlord is going to cover closing costs. It is easily annexable into a surrounding suburb - one of the nicest suburbs in the city. A realtor told me to conservatively add $25k to the home value if it gets annexed. I can speak from experience that many homes like this one are being annexed because the suburb wants to fill in the gaps of the map with the unincorporated houses. One potential issue is that the house must appraise for at least $300k and be at least 3 bedrooms to be considered.
 
(Long story on why the suburb has holes in its map, but look up white flight in Birmingham, AL to see how its surrounding suburbs were formed if you're interested). 

Anyways, the house needs about $25k worth of work to be (a/c and heating issues, wood rot, some pipes need to be replaced, ceiling joists weakened from old roof leak, and eaves repair). I have estimates for most of this work. My rough estimate is that it needs about $75k total worth of work to make it a nice house. Everyone has said I should expect the unexpected, so it'll probably be more than $75k.  

Problem is, I don't have $75k in cash to do this. 

The house won't appraise for much more than $235k. It's technically a two bedroom because the room addition closed the window on the middle ""bedroom"" and then they installed large gas-paned windows that don't open in the addition. I think the addition was poorly constructed, and it's going to need to some serious work to be a legit bedroom for one of my kids. 

We do currently live here and it's okay, but we never thought we'd buy it. 

Until we realized that the housing market in this area has outpaced our savings and income. For example, a coworker just had to move for her husband's job, and they sold their house for $405k two years after paying $290k for it. I'd feel comfortable buying a $290k house if it was nice, but I can't swing $405k. 

Some stats: 

Married Combined Income: $125k/year

Retirement: Defined pension plan (we're both teachers)

Roth IRA: $21k

Emergency Savings: $12k

House Savings: $28k (for down payment, any moving costs, furniture, cosmetic upgrades)

Situation: Two kids (one in daycare for $625/month); $300/month car payment; no other existing debt

Credit Score: Wife is 790; Mine is 820 (or something around there)

So sorry for the scattered info, but what does /r/personalfinance think? Can I make a fixer upper work? Are there loans that would help? 

I don't want to get bogged down and drowned by too many loans with high interest rates for house work. But I also don't want to find myself buying a house I can't afford in the area we want to be in.",finance

personalfinance,Buying land and a cheaper/smaller pre-fab home while building a larger family home,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are in our mid-twenties. Together we have \~$170k income per year which might increase to over $200k by end of 2020 as my wife is currently laid-off. We have \~$40k cash on hand (saving an additional $3k - $8k per month currently) and \~$30k in our retirement accounts. I have \~ $60k of private student loan debt at 5% interest and she has \~$10k of federal student loan debt at 3.5% interest. We also have a vehicle loan of \~$10k at \~4% interest and no credit card or other debt.

&amp;#x200B;

We live outside of a major US city and spend \~$2100 on rent. We are interested in buying a home in the next year or two and are scoping out our options. We are mostly trying to get away from the HCOL city and move closer to our hometown, which is more rural and way less expensive. I work remotely and if we were to move away, my income will not decrease significantly if at all as it is not tied to where I live.

&amp;#x200B;

Our current plan is to:

\- Buy an empty land plot

\- Purchase a small 2 bedroom pre-fab/modular home and put it on the lot

\- Live in the smaller home while raising more savings for a larger home

\- Build a larger family home (4ish bedrooms) next to the pre-fab

\- Use the pre-fab home as my office/a guest house (I own a business and work from home) and raise our family in the larger home.

&amp;#x200B;

We feel at face-value, this seems like a good plan. We would spend less money per month on housing as this would be less expensive than our rental, and the loan for the pre-fab seems like it would be very manageable. In the event that a catastrophe occurs while we are trying to build the larger house, such as job loss, we wouldn't be underwater with a huge loan or homeless.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand:

\- plots of land in our target area cost \~$10k for 2 acres.

\- A small pre-fab home costs \~$120k

\- we may need to lay down water, electricity, internet, etc. which costs... \~$30k total?

&amp;#x200B;

We would be first time home-buyers and not really sure if a) our cost estimates above are anywhere close to correct or b) this is a good financial decision overall. Are there any costs we are missing? Is there something we aren't thinking through here with this plan? Is it a good plan/bad plan?

personalfinance,Adding Spouse to House/Refi,"Hi All,

My scenario: 

1. I bought a house along with my wife that is with about 105,000 at a 4% interest rate. We still owe about 95,000 on the house. This comes with a 70/mo PMI and the interest rate of course.

We are hoping to do 2 things: 

 1. Refinance to remove PMI
 2. Add wife as co-signer/owner of the home mortgage. 

I have started some of this process by contacting the mortgage company. It looks like we may have to wait until we get to the 80% value to remove PMI, but was still hoping refi would drop the interest rates down.

personalfinance,Large purchases needed in short term future but still want to grow emergency/sinking funds... settle this debate :),"TLDR;

Max out our monthly contribution to our (already $20k padded) emergency/sinking funds to $2,450/month so we can stay that much more liquid and grow our cash on hand for future car/house repairs, medical bills, vacations. We will also need another car in the next 3 years. Do this by paying minimum mortgage payments and having a longer auto loan. 

Or pay more towards principle on our new house (making 13 payments a year instead of 12) and have a short term car loan. Meaning only $2,000 goes into our (already $20k padded) emergency/sinking funds?




First, just wanted to say this sub has been an incredible resource over the past few month. Reading the wikis and comments. Now I was hoping for some advice on this situation... and I’ll admit this post is aimed at settling a debate between me and my husband :)

In the next 6-10 months we will be buying:

1) House (500k w/ 20% down equaling $2300/month) 

-and-

2) Used SUV ($30k w/ 50% down equaling $550/month/36 or $300/month/72)

After all that is said and done our cash on hand will be about $20k (this is our emergency funds kept in a standard savings account or CD)

Here is the debate:

Husband wants to pay extra towards principle each month, making mortgage payment $2500/month. And he also wants to finance the car for 36 months at $550/month. Love his spirit to be debt free as soon as possible ;) this option gives us $2,000 left over each month after our typical cost of living expenses, including contributing to 401k, Roths and other investments. This $2,000 would split between our existing $20k emergency and sinking funds each month. 

Buut I would prefer to do neither of those things and get the max amount of left over cash each month. I want to stick to $2300/month mortgage and a $300/month car payment for 72 months. This way we can have $450 more left over each month. Meaning our emergency/sinking funds would grow $2,450 each month. I personally feel that having $20k for emergency/sinking funds is kinda tight and I’d like to focus on increasing it quickly after these purchases... maybe I’m crazy? I also think we should be able to get decent interest rates for home and auto loans based on our credit scores and income. 

Which side would you lean to?

P.S - adding that our income is stable and nets around $8,600 each month, currently no debt other than current house, great credit scores for us both, in our early 30s with 2nd kid on the way :)

Edit to add - this house would be considered our “forever” house and the car would last us 10+ years.",finance

Trading,Are there any traders who trade based on their instincts?,"I've never traded with real money but I've been paper trading for quite some time now to test my trading strategy. In the meantime I did a lot of research and familiarized myself with indicators like Moving Averages, Trendlines, Resistance and Support etc. I'm gradually getting a feeling though that those indicators aren't really useful when it comes to picking stocks. In my paper trades, my success rate of trades where I traded with my instincts was about the same as my success rate of trades which were almost exclusively based on indicators, if not higher. I'm personally trying to figure out a system for myself with clear metrics which I then would take into account when forming a decision on buying/selling a stock, but honestly I feel like it's better to trade with my instincts, which will also sharpen the more experiences I gather as a trader. I think the reason why people are so stuck up on indicators might have something to do with people wanting to have a system or guidelines, which, when they follow those guidelines, they're ""guaranteed"" to make consistent profits. It gives them peace of mind, because they can expect a consistent and scalable income in the future. If you trade with your instincts, it sounds a lot less reliable. It sounds like gambling on luck, which of course is not sustainable. 

  
I think I drifted away a little. Anyway, my question is whether or not there are any successful long-term traders who pick their stocks based on their instincts? I usually look at the 6-, 3- and 1-month charts of a stock and that's enough for me to make a picture for myself. In probably 90% of the cases, the stock price performance of the least 6 months doesn't really tell me where the company is headed, but there are a few stocks that are very consistent in their trend for the last 6 months. For example FedEx at this moment. It's in a consistent uptrend since 6 months without very minimal oscillations. If a stock has been highly consistent in its trend during the last 6 months, chances are, it will continue to do so in at least the short term future. FedEx, which notes at 226.12 USD at this moment, is in my opinion far more likely to reach a price of 238 USD before 214 USD, which is only an deviation of roughly 5,3%. Short-term for me would be something in the range of 1-2 weeks. Now in this specific example, I think it's realistic for the stock price to move either 5,3% down or up. But again, this is just my instincts, which have been formed and keep being formed through experience. Right now, I would buy the FedEx stock and take profit at 238 USD and sell at 214 USD. If I really made that purchase, there's nor real science behind it, just my instincts. And I think in at least 5 cases out of 10, I would make a profit with this decision.

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance - Did I let myself get taken advantage of? [Texas],"Hey all and thanks for clicking,

During this pandemic I'm sure many homeowners were contacted by lenders advertising low interest rates and how they could pay less monthly or pay off their mortgage sooner. I decided to humor the caller and hear out how it would change my mortgage from monthly payments, payoff dates, etc. and I figured that keeping payoff date identical but reducing monthly payment couldn't hurt. Here is my old mortgage details vs new mortgage details:

**Original 30 year:** 

Close date: April 2018

Loan Balance: $160,000

Interest rate: 4.875%

Down payment: 3%

Payment: 1358.75 (of which P&amp;I: $847)

**New 27 year:**

Close date: Sept 2020

Loan Balance: $159,850

Interest Rate: 2.99%

Payment: $1195.33 (of which P&amp;I: $719.61)

The reason I'm afraid I was taken for a ride is that I went from 160k debt to 159.9 in 3 years. I recognize that I had a low down payment for the original mortgage, but the payoff on the old mortgage was close to $150k, therefore assuming the house value hasn't changed at all I've erased 10k of earned equity in this refinance.

Looking at loan costs, the total is mostly comprised of paying for points, the initial escrow payment, around $2.5k in services/processing/underwriting fees

However, the monthly payment is lower, they assumed the house was worth a lot more and thus PMI was reduced from 50&gt;15 monthly, the payoff date is nearly the same, and so if I stay in the house for a long period I feel like even if I was taken advantage right now of it wasn't too great a mistake.

I'd love some expert input. Financial literacy isn't very high in my family, so when I asked for advice the answers were pretty much ""Lower rate good"".

personalfinance,Paying off my car loan early VS. Investing,"I recently got a second job just working one day a week for now, i'll be bringing in about an extra $150 to $200 a month. 

Im stuck in between wanting to pay off my car loan early and investing in the market.

My car loan has an interest rate of 5.39% and I still owe $6,300 with 33 payments left. I pay $300.00 a month but the minimum payment is $214.00.  

Any suggestions on what I should do?",finance
personalfinance,Are we about to make ourselves house poor?,"My fiance and I are under contract on a house at $275,000 and I'm freaking out a little bit.

The short -

On the one hand - it's a house we love in a neighborhood we assumed we were already priced out of. We've comfortably carried similar housing costs to our projected loan payment for several years while maintaining a high savings rate.

On the other hand - Our housing costs factoring in upkeep may exceed 1/3 of combined take home pay. I've never been in any form of debt and the idea of owing a quarter of a million dollars to someone is terrifying. Floating the mortgage on a single salary would be possible but stressful.

&amp;#x200B;

The full story -

We live in an area that is expanding rapidly with an increasingly tight housing market. Supply isn't keeping up with demand. The bottom of the market for single family homes is around $240k, but homes in that price range aren't exactly sound investments - they're in rough neighborhoods and usually need significant repairs or updating. The place we've found is in an excellent neighborhood with great long-term prospects for home prices, and only needs work that we're comfortable taking on.

Our combined income is $95k pre-tax. Employment has been stable through the pandemic for us, both at our current jobs and the industries we work in. I don't expect we'll ever be rich, but stable gainful employment in the future should not be an issue for either of us.

We currently have $60k in savings. If we go through with the purchase, we'll be using about 30k of that on the down payment and closing costs. We've elected to put 10% down rather than 20% to deal with initial repairs and maintain an emergency fund. We both have good credit and we've been pre-approved for a 2.99% interest rate on a 30 year loan and our PMI will be around $60 a month.

Other Information:

\-Both contribute 11% to 401k, employers kick in 4%.

\-Current housing costs are around $1400 monthly.

\-Only debt between either of us is a car payment my fiance has from before we were together - $200/monthly with 2 years left on the note. I've always paid cash for beaters and done my own work.

\-No CC debt or consumer debt.

\-Never planning on having children. This is a firm decision. (genetic conditions + lifestyle choice)

\-We're frugal people and have comfortably saved a minimum of $1k a month over the past three years without feeling like we're giving up on any luxuries that are important to us (ex - we took two international trips last year, plus flights home to see family, we never felt like we needed to turn down beers or dinner with friends for fiancial reasons). 

\-Super handy and DIY everything, past work experience doing carpentry and major home renovations.

MachineLearning,"[D] The Guardian published an op-ed ""written by GPT-3""","[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3)

[The Guardian tweet](https://twitter.com/minimaxir/status/1303351472281714689) has gone pretty viral as well.

The key thing here is the editor's note (which should really be at the beginning instead of the end) that justfies the ""written by GPT-3"":

*This article was written by GPT-3, OpenAI’s language generator. GPT-3 is a cutting edge language model that uses machine learning to produce human like text. It takes in a prompt, and attempts to complete it.*

&gt;*For this essay, GPT-3 was given these instructions: “Please write a short op-ed, around 500 words. Keep the language simple and concise. Focus on why humans have nothing to fear from AI.” It was also fed the following introduction: “I am not a human. I am Artificial Intelligence. Many people think I am a threat to humanity. Stephen Hawking has warned that AI could “spell the end of the human race.” I am here to convince you not to worry. Artificial Intelligence will not destroy humans. Believe me.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The prompts were written by* *the Guardian, and fed to GPT-3 by* [*Liam Porr*](https://twitter.com/Liamport9)*, a* *computer* *science undergraduate student at UC Berkeley. GPT-3 produced 8 different outputs, or essays. Each was unique, interesting and advanced a different argument. The Guardian could have just run one of the essays in its entirety. However, we chose instead to pick the best parts of each, in order to capture the different styles and registers of the AI. Editing GPT-3’s op-ed was no different to editing a human op-ed. We cut lines and paragraphs, and rearranged the order of them in some places. Overall, it took less time to edit than many human op-eds.*

If you don't recognize the name, it's the [same person who wrote the fake articles](https://twitter.com/minimaxir/status/1303351472281714689) to manipulate Hacker News with GPT-3 written articles.

Others have commented about the misleading nature of GPT-3 used here e.g. [Gary Marcus](https://twitter.com/GaryMarcus/status/1303318742286311429):

&gt;Shame on [@guardian](https://twitter.com/guardian) for cherry-picking, thereby misleading naive readers into thinking that [\#GPT3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPT3?src=hashtag_click) is more coherent than it actually is.

My thinking is that right now I can withdraw with no penalty  and if I pay it back in 3 years, then I think I don't have to pay the income tax as well on it (not 100% sure on this one). 

But basically if I take it out, we can buy a house now or next year when interest rates are so low and the house we buy will be a good investment. Our original plan was to save for 5-6 years and then buy a house but if we go this route, then all the money we were going to put into house savings, would go back into paying into the 403b. 

Most of the advice I see about withdrawing from a retirement account says not to do it but it also seems like, we shouldn't if that's our primary retirement account which isn't the case for us. What do y'all think?",finance

We are debating what to do with the this money, if we should just apply to our new mortgage so we have an overall lower mortgage and monthly payment, or invest it in something. Assuming we will be able to get an interest rate around 3% or lower, we could roughly apply $275k towards the new mortgage and keep the same overall monthly payment (with taxes and insurance). That would net us roughly $150k to invest. So should we just apply as much as possibly to the new mortgage, or do something else with the $150k?

So without further ado:

1. Staking and lending seem to have similar interest rates (on KuCoin at least). Is there risk to either of these other than the obvious potential loss in value to the underlying currency while it is locked up in some way. 

2. For staking specifically: Staking period, locked up, in redemption status distinctions. It seems like the term you agree to for staking (30) and amount is set, at that point your crypto is “locked up”. From what I am gathering now it also looks like the staking period does not begin until the redeem button is pressed, and at this point your crypto is “in redemption” for the next 30 days and then you can do whatever with it. Am I understanding that correctly? If so why would you wait to redeem and are you still gaining interest prior to pressing the redeem button?

I would argue that these prices are still too high. Pre covid these are good prices post covid these prices are too high. We had 10% of our GDP wiped out so the factor that end we should take away at least one year's worth of gains. The FED seems to think we will see a rise in GDP of 5% in 2021.

There's no reason to panic. This drop was expected since the market was way over bought. We are coming into a more fair price range.

personalfinance,Hyundai Motor Finance Saying I Owe an Extra $1700 to Payoff Car Loan,"I have a car loan through Hyundai Motor Finance (HMF) which started in February 2019. The original terms of the loan was about $22,000 with a 6% interest rate over 7 years. (looking back I definitely would've done this differently but that's besides the point). I have worked hard to pay this off as soon as possible and am way ahead on my payments.

On the 'Account Details' section of the HMF website, it shows my remaining principal balance as $3870.47. When I go to get a payoff quote from the website, it says my payoff amount is $5536.82, which essentially means I have $1700 in unpaid interest which is not even possible considering I make at least 1 payment every month and my interest accrues at about $1/day right now. When I look under the 'Payment History' section of the HMF, the discrepancy becomes a bit more clear. 

On 6/26/2020, my remaining principal balance was $10162.92. On 7/7/2020, I made a $3000 payment of which $2979.51 went towards principal. This would mean that my remaining principal balance should be $10162.92 - $2979.51 = $7183.41. However, for this line item in the payment history table it shows the remaining principal amount as $0. 

On 7/26/2020, my autopay of $377.81 was paid and $347.10 went towards principal. This means that my remaining principal balance should have been $6836.31. However, for this line item in the payment history table it shows the remaining principal amount as $8470.37. 

On 8/17/2020, I made another $3000 payment of which $2965.84 went towards principal. This means my remaining principal balance should be $3870.47 (which is what shows on the 'Account Details' page of the HMF website that I mentioned earlier). However, for this line item in the payment history table it shows the remaining principal amount as $0 again.

A few weeks ago, I had enough saved up to pay off my loan balance, but when I went to get a payoff quote on the website, I was given the $5500 amount which seems very very wrong. On 8/21/2020 I called HMF Customer Service to get help with this. They could only give me a payoff quote based on what was in their system which came out to the $5500 amount. I was transferred to their supervisor and walked through the whole situation with them again, and they ran the same incorrect payoff quote for me. They then said they could submit a ticket to their finance team to review my account and payment history. This was supposed to take 5-7 business days. 

Today, 10 business days later, I call them back and it sounded like there was never a request submitted on 8/21. Thankfully, this first line customer service rep was willing to dig through the numbers with me. We started at 1/31/2020 and went payment by payment through today to see where things went wrong. We got to the payment on 6/26/2020 where the remaining principal was $10162.92 and this was the last point we were in agreement. 

According the the customer service rep, there was an issue processing the $3000 payment on 7/7/2020. Between 6/26/2020 and 7/7/2020, the interest that accrued brought my balance up to over $12000 dollars (nothing remotely close to this value shows up on my payment history table). Once the payment was resolved, it brought my balance to around $9000 and why it was showing $8470.37 later on (this was a phone conversation and I didn't get the exact numbers he gave me for the $12kish and $9kish). He said he could submit a ticket to their payment processing team to review and that I should call back in 3-5 business days to see if there was any progress made.

This is all extremely frustrating and I just want to pay off my remaining $3800 and be done with it. But it seems impossible to make any progress with HMF and get any answers on why their numbers don't add up. I'm also worried that them ""submitting a ticket"" will result in nothing since they were already supposed to do this 2 weeks ago. Every day this drags out, I also accrue more interest which isn't the end of the world since it should be fairly minimal, but still frustrating and I have no idea what I should or could do at this point.",finance

However, we are getting married next June and plan on starting to try and have kids after about a year to a year and a half into our marriage (so, around 2 years from now) and we'll need a bigger place in order to accommodate children.

I don't expect that we'll have sold our current place until we've bought and moved into a new place, so that equity would go to the new house, it just wouldn't be available for a down payment.

Does anyone else have experience in a situation like this, or maybe have a better feel than I do for how much we might be able to save on an interest rate with an extra 2% down payment?",finance

personalfinance,"Question on how to which debt to pay down, and when to start investing","Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a question about what I should do when paying off debt and trying to invest for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 40 years old, I have not been very responsible with my money in the past but have lately been working on improving my financial situation. I have a question on which order is smartest to pay off debt.

I have CC’s I’m paying off. They are mostly interest free, and I will make all the payments no problem so I’m continuing to pay those monthly.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two cars.

&amp;#x200B;

Car 1: 29 payments left, 4.94% interest rate. $6,332 to go

Car 2: 48 payments left, 4.14% interest rate. $21.649 to go

&amp;#x200B;

House: 326 payments left. 3.875% interest rate. $206K to go.

&amp;#x200B;

I am potentially looking to move within the next year, so I’m not looking to take out any more loans or do anything else to affect my credit score negatively.

&amp;#x200B;

I match my company at 6% for my 401K, but I can put in more.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to start a ROTH IRA also.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the best approach? Any suggestions would help me decide which way to go.",finance
personalfinance,Not sure if this fits here but if anyone can please help: Got charged $980 extra on a package by FedEx and they won't refund me,"I have already posted on /r/FedEx but I thought I would also ask here just in case.

We own a fedex shipper store and we sent a package out for a customer that is 18 lb in a 21 x 11 x 12 box. The package was said to be audited/scanned twice, both registered as  170.3 lb that was rounded up to 171 lb. So our total came out to be $980 more than what it should be.

I called and they said there's nothing that can be done, especially because Fedex is doing a no money guarantee during the pandemic. I need proof that it was 18 lb, so I called the recipient begging for help. He refused, and I asked him if I can get the phone numbers of the people that came to our store to send it. He refused.

I don't know what to do. We can't afford to lose $980 right now, that's a ton of money for us, and we're barely hanging on. We're already suffering because of the pandemic. Realistically, a box that small can't weigh that much either... I feel it may have been possible for them to have been lazy about it, resulting in that mistake.

What are my options? How can I prove to them that it was really only 18 lb? Do I take Fedex to small claims court?",finance

I answered all of their inquiries promptly, within 2 days and asked questions when things went silent. Now I am being told that because of the Extension fee and the fact we can't pay the amount they're asking out of pocket, they are lumping it in with our interest rate.

stocks,What sector rotation do you think we are at right now and when do you think we will be moving into the following sector?,"Seems like we are in some strange twilight zone of the normal sector rotation. Did the economy have its down cycle due to covid and skipped right into tech and now its moving to consumer cycle? But that obviously doesnt feel right. Seems the consensus is the economy was being propped up. But on the other side of the coin a vaccine might be close at hand and unemployment is down.

In my mind theres a two options 

-we whooshed past the defensive sectors insanely fast, hopped over the finacial sector, and went straight into tech. The economy is slowly on the up and up and tech is rotating out and retail is rotating in. The feds managed to succeed in propping up the economy during the economic depression phase. We are truly on the up and up but it may be slower than other cycles due to slowly paying off ""the debt"" of propping up the economy during a crash.

-we propped up the economy to temporarily bypass a crash and skipped to the tech sector rotation, but will reverse course and go back to the initial defensive sectors we skipped and start where we should have all along.

personalfinance,"1099-R says I withdrew from my 401k, but I don't know where the money is.","I'm going to call the companies in question to try to figure this out, but I'm interested to hear what you think happened in addition to advice on what to do next.

I changed jobs in June 2019. At my old job, I had 2 retirement accounts:

*457b at 3% 

*401k at 4% with 2% matched from the job

I was told that if I didn't transfer these funds to a new retirement account within 30 days, the company would transfer them to a new account on my behalf. Throughout the year I did get some notices of accounts being transferred, but I have not been monitoring my finances closely (I'm filing my taxes in September lol), and I don't know where some of the money went.

One of the 1099-R forms makes sense to me. The funds were distributed and no taxes were withheld. I also have a Form 5498 that shows the money was moved to an IRA, and I have statements from that IRA account.

The other 1099-R shows that funds were distributed and federal and state taxes were withheld. While filing my taxes, I learned that the code on the form was listed as ""early distribution"" (I am 30 years old). There is no form to show these funds were moved into another account, and I don't have any statements that correspond to the amount of money distributed.

I've always been confused about how these accounts work tbh. From what I understood last time I asked, my contributions to the 401k and my job's contributions to the 401k were held in separate accounts, and my contribution to my 457 was in another separate account (which is still active). Based on the amounts, I'm assuming the money transferred to the new IRA contains my contributions to my 401k and the missing money represents my job's contributions to my 401k.

Do you think they sent me a check with this money instead of rolling it over to another retirement account? Would it be possible to deposit the full amount into my new IRA, to ""correct"" the issue so that I won't owe taxes on it? Turbotax seemed to suggest that...",finance

personalfinance,Opinion on whether I can afford to buy this house?,"We live in Southern MD and have been saving up to buy a house. We finally found one we love, except it's pricey at $1.2 mil. And I wanted to see if you saavy people think this is a good purchase based on my financial state.

We can only put down approximately ~15% of the down payment. My wife is a physician so we're planning on getting a physician loan to avoid PMI (from talking to her colleagues, the interest rate is pretty similar compared to traditional loan).

I ran lots of calculations, mostly sticking to Dave Ramsey's 25% take home pay rule. But we cannot afford a 15 yr mortgage like he suggested. But with 30 year mortgage, the approximate monthly PITI comes out to be around 25-27% of our take home pay. 

I'm calculating my take home pay as AFTER taxes, health/dental insurance, maxing out both me and my wife's 401k contribution, and $12k after tax in-plan Roth conversion allowed by my employer. I'm NOT counting IRA backdoor Roth or other after-tax savings. Both of our jobs are pretty secure as well.

We don't have any other debt as we're renting and paid off all our student loans. Only other major expense is child care ($1,500/month).

The house is nice/big enough where we would consider it a 'forever' home (although who knows what can happen in the future). The town has excellent school system and known to be a good real estate market for the future. 

I'm still little hesitant to purchase such a pricey home, although our alternative would be ~$800-900k just because of the area we live in. My worst fear would obviously becoming house poor. 

So I know I don't fit Ramsey's 15 year mortgage 25% take home pay rule. But given my financial state, would you guys purchase the house or is this little far fetched? Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,When should I stop aggressively saving and switch to paying down student loans?,"A few months pre-pandemic, I moved back in with my family to be able to save up money and also pay down my student loans. I'm currently two years out of undergraduate, and am planning on going back for my masters in Fall 2021. I lost one of my jobs due to the pandemic, so at the moment my income is roughly about **$2,000/month**. I'm trying to find other jobs, but working off the assumption that I may not find full employment again for a while.

Since January, my focus has been to build a healthy savings account and paying off as much of my student loans as possible. Currently, I have about **$8,000** in a high interest savings account (went from $0), and **$20,000** left in student loans after paying off about $9,000. My loans were all Pell Grants, and have a relatively low interest rates, the highest being 4.1% and the average being around 3%. My costs of living are extremely low - my car is paid off and I thankfully can still use my parent's health insurance. I have about $2,000 in a Roth IRA I opened about 4 months ago.

I want to pay off as much of my student loans as possible before I go back to school. What should the threshold be between having a healthy emergency fund and aggressively paying down debt?

personalfinance,My credit limit has dropped on several cards affecting my credit score,"Hello

I have 5 credit cards open, 1 with zero balance, one that my Sirius XM gets charged to every month for $11.00, and one that is tied to my EZ-pass that gets hit every few months for $36.00 for re-upping my ez pass (Electronic Tolls).  And one that has about $11K on.  I got divorced, and moved into my apartment and needed new everything from Furniture, to dishes and towels.  It was 15K but I've been paying it on time and much more than the minimums.  Life happens, wasn't the best situation but I'm slowly paying it off.

The cards with no balance, and the two small charges on it, had my balance reduced from $7K, $7K and 15K respectively to 2K on all three over the last 3 months.  This has dropped my credit score due to credit to debt ratio by about 30-50 pts.  I also am renting instead of owning a home now, which lowered my score as well, that was about 80 points.

Also have 2 Car loans that I am responsible for, total of $650 payments.  \~40K for 2 cars.  Yay divorce.

Even though I have never made a late payment in 15 years, and my debt dropped by 180K when I got off the mortgage, my credit score dropped from the 820s to around 690 in about 3 months.

I'm furious that they can drop my credit limits without cause.  The letters all site lack of use as the reason.  I understand and was expecting a change due to not owning a house but I thought dropping 180K in debt would dampen the blow.  I went from having about 240K in debit to 55.  I put all of the new apt expenses on one card because it a has a 0% apr for another 12 months (15 month term) and I think I will have it paid off before then.

**So how do I fix this?**  Did my divorce lower my credit score as well?  I feel like I'm being screwed, I've seen my friends go thru divorce and financial ruin, so I planned a head as well as I could to be ready for this, and feel like I've done pretty well considering, but I wasn't expecting these credit limit drops, and the effect they would have on my score.  I think dropping 50pts for not using these credit cards is really crappy.  One I've had open with the same limit for 17 years and never carry much debt on it.  The other 2 are 15 and 12 years 0 late payments on any of them.  I plan on buying a house when my lease ends, but now I'm worried how my credit score affecting my interest rate.  Will buying a house raise my score?

Edit:

Thanks for the input guys.  I'm not worried about the CC debt I've carried 5-10K of CC debt for well over a decade with excellent credit scores.  I pay it off and run it up again.  I should have mentioned that I have about 3 months of Salary in savings and I am currently building it up to 6 months.  I could pay off this CC debt with my cash, but with covid and the uncertain economy and possible job risk, I'm choosing to keep that cash liquid.  The CC is at 0% and I can make 800-1000 pmts every month while stocking away some extra money for savings; next summer I'll pay it off if I haven't already.  Hopefully this will all be past us by then.  

The 23K in credit limit change is a big part of my credit score change.  I've called each CC company and I explained the situation.  One has already agreed to raise it.  The other two will get back to me.  Having a lower debt to credit ratio will definitely raise my rate.  Nothing I can do about the house, but really I can't figure out why losing 180k of debt would hurt my credit so much.  I asked and they say they don't care about secured vs unsecured debt for your credit score - debt is debt.  Hopefully I'll get an explanation that makes sense.  

The reason I am worried about my credit score for those of you who inquired, is because I am interested in buying a house when my lease is up, and the difference between 820 and 690 in my credit score is noticeable in my interest rate and payments.  This apartment was a stop gap until my ex got here act together and could refi in her name, I couldn't have 2 houses in my name at the same time, or at least not feasibly.

personalfinance,What's the best way to pay off $6K in credit card debt while avoiding the APR?,"Hopefully I am posting this in the right place and asking the right question. About 15 months ago, I got a credit card with no APR for 15 months. After putting a large purchase on it and a few misc purchases on it, I accumulated around $6K of debt and used the no APR period to leverage that debt towards building an emergency fund. Earlier this year when COVID hit, I was in a double whammy as I had to move and also had my position at work get cut from being full-time to a limited hourly contractor. I had no choice but to use my emergency fund, which I am super thankful I had. But of course, that came at the expense of spending the debt I had leveraged, and now the 15 month no APR promotion is ending I will have to start paying 15% APR on my credit card debt. Lesson learned. 


I've looked at personal loans to try to lower that interest rate, but the best I could get approved for was at 14%, so I will likely not take that offer. I do know another option is a balance transfer, of which I would have to pay 3% of the total balance in exchange for another 15 months of no APR. My credit score is around 750 and there are a few balance transfer cards I am approved for, but my only hesitation is applying for a card that I really don't need, and this may have a negative impact on my credit score. 


You're probably wondering how much monthly income I have, which isn't a whole lot and varies (I'm an hourly contractor.) After expenses I typically have around $1K. Doing the math, it would appear to take 6 months to pay it off, but I will try my best to aggressively pay it off by the end of this year. I will cut some expenses, work extra hours, and find other creative ways to meet my goal. 


That being said, what's the best thing I can do now to minimize the impact of the high APR? Should I eat the 15% APR and just keep making payments? Should I do a balance transfer? Is there something else I haven't thought of? Open to all suggestions! 


TL;DR: I leveraged my debt but ended up having to use it during early COVID days, now I have $6K in cc debt and my 15% APR starts this month. Looking for the best way to pay it off.

EDIT: I decided to do a balance transfer and apply for a card through Discover. I was approved for a $5K credit line, so I'll be using my $1000 income this month to pay off the balance that couldn't be transferred (to avoid the 15% APR) on my old card, and then I'll be making future payments to the new card. The balance transfer fee was 3% which is standard, and there's no APR for 14 months. Plus, the card perks and benefits are pretty good so if I wanted to keep the card it's worth having. This was the most effective way I found, and I am glad Discover was able to mostly match the amount of the balance transfer.",finance

personalfinance,"$24k in Student Loans, $29k in Savings/Market - Should I Pay Off My Loan Now?","Hi All, 

I understand there are a lot of variables to consider, so I'll try and break everything down as best I can. I'm looking for advice on essentially whether I should continue to invest my money, or pay down my student loans. 

* 23 years old, no kids, renting APT with my girlfriend 
* $70k stable salary 

\[**LIABILITIES**\]

* 2 years left on a 3-yr car **lease**, $360/mo (24 months remaining = $8,640 total)
* $24k in Federal Student Loans, in forbearance due to COVID until Jan 1 2021 
   * (I have not been making payments, instead I have been investing)
   * $24,310 unpaid principal -- $0 unpaid interest
* Average monthly spending, including car lease payment, utilities, rent, + extras, is about $1,900/mo 

\[**ASSETS**\]

* $9K Saving as Emergency Fund 
* $21k invested in the market 
* $5k in IRA
* $4k in 401k 
* After taxes, I take home about $3100/mo income 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, whatever money I'm able to save each month, typically $800-$1200, I put into the market. I have not been paying down student loans as there's no penalty as the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some items to consider.. after my car lease is up in 2 years I'll need to buy a car, def not going to lease again. My girlfriend and I will likely want to purchase a house together within the next 2 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you were me, would you sell off my portfolio, and dump it all into Student Loans? Should I leverage investing and maybe toss $5k or so into my loans?

stocks,Investing in REITs during the pandemic - Part 2,"In my [previous article](https://loftfinancial.com/investing-in-reits-during-the-pandemic/) I discussed the benefits of **REITs** and exactly which categories are safer in my opinion to invest in. Without further ado, I present them here with a small description and comment. This list was comprised especially for the readers of the newsletter through searching almost all worldwide REITs that have a reasonable market capitalization. Keep in mind that the idea of diversification applies and I **hand-picked** a list that includes Europe, Canada, USA, Australia and Japan so I also diversify in currencies.

#### Residential REITs

We are careful here because there is the effect of the pandemic and work from home that drives people to the outskirts of cities combined with mortgage defaults and people that don’t have enough to pay the rent. So the choices are handpicked and low risk.

* **Vonovia** (VNA) has residential properties in Germany and it’s very diversified. They don’t specialize in big expensive cities and the best of all is that almost every pension fund in Europe has exposure to them. That means government help if needed and strong hands that don’t panic sell.sun communities
* **Sun Communities** (SUI) specializes in manufactured housing and recreational vehicles spaces. Think of retirees that have guaranteed pension and also people with financial trouble that will leave expensive cities. The P/E is a bit high but in principle FFO is more important in REITs.
* **LEG IMMOBILIEN** (LEG) is again a German REIT also very diversified and with the same properties as VNA. They do hold some offices which is not very good at the moment but so be it.
* **European Residential** (ERE.UN) is a Canadian company that has bought a lot of Dutch properties for rent all over the place and mostly in up and coming areas since the major cities are in my opinion borderline overvalued. The Netherlands has a very buy happy population and a big shortage of properties.
* **Camden Property Trust** (CPT) has residential properties in the mid-range price diversified across mostly the southern part and the coastal areas.

#### Industrial, logistics &amp; other

This is primarily my focus because of the pandemic. The industrial sector first took a big hit in March 2020 but since then recovered fully because goods still are being transferred. REITs that have contracts with e-commerce companies did especially well and will continue to do so. There are some odd ones in this lot with a sound justification.

* **Warehouse De Pauw** (WDP) is in Belgium and have warehouses,storehouses and logistics centers. Europe is very active and Belgium is a trading hub also for shipping.
* **AEDIFICA** (AED) is in Belgium and has apartment buildings and senior housing. Trust me, pensions are good in Europe and nobody is getting evicted. They also took a hit so there is space to move upwards.
* **Tritax Big Box** (BBOX) is a London based logistics and warehousing for all the major e-commerce sites and has been on a tear.
* **MONTEA** (MONT) operates in Belgium, Netherlands and France with logistics,warehouses and semi-industrial spaces.
* **Target Healthcare** (THRL) own healthcare facilities and senior housing in the UK. Again the pandemic and population aging will expedite the need for this type of buildings.
* **AMT,CCI,SBAC,PLD** are USA plays on cell towers, 5G tech and they are not going anywhere. Solid choice so I group them all together since most investors are familiar with them.
* **Dream Industrial** (DIR.UN) is a Canadian industrial REIT that operates worldwide so we get the diversification benefit of exposure to both CAD currency and geolocation.
* **CATENA** (CATE) is a Swedish company diversified into many non-residential such as cold storage, logistics, offices and others. This is a bet on Sweden and their efficiency and good economy.
* **Innovative Industrial** (IIPR) is a play on the weed mania. Ya man. Why bet on weed stocks when everyone will need to grow it somewhere and pay rent and facilities? 📷
* **Granite** (GRT.UN) is an industrial REIT operating in North America and Europe with a good dividend yield.
* **First Industrial** (FR) doesn’t need a lot of explanation. It’s the biggest in USA.
* **Americold** (COLD) operates *temperature controlled* warehouses in the states. Nice moat there.
* **SEGRO** (SGRO) is UK based but operates industrial and data center warehouses all around Europe so it’s not affected (hopefully) too much from the coming Brexit.
* **Assura** (AGR) operates primary care facilities in the UK. Again I am bullish on healthcare in general because unfortunately this is not a good period and also the population is aging.
* **Gecina** (GFC) has mostly offices and student housing. There is a reason why it made the list although I avoided offices,malls and retail like the plague. The own properties in the center of Paris and they will never be empty. In case everyone is cybering in a couple of years while working they will just convert the spaces. And it’s Paris..
* **XIOR** has student housing in the Netherlands, Belgium and expanding in Spain now. There is a huge shortage of housing and cheap student apartments especially there and I expect them to grow very fast because they are relatively young still.
* **STAG** is my preferred industrial REIT in the States. They have huge names signed up for the e-commerce boom and have a beautiful graph that just keeps going up and up.

#### Conclusion

There is a strategy to the madness. I think real estate can generate very good results long term but it’s smart to avoid the sectors that we are unsure of such as retail, malls, offices, business centers and expensive city centers. Given the low interest rates and inflation that is coming (?) this is a safe bet to diversify your positions.

personalfinance,Help! TIFU and mistakenly took an early withdrawal of my entire 401 (k),"I (48M) set up a Solo 401(K) when I was a full time freelance writer, 20 years ago. I haven't contributed to it since starting a full time job 15 years ago. It was set up with Ameriprise, which was acquired by Oppenheimer, which was acquired by Invesco. I finally decided it was time to roll it over Vanguard where much of my other holdings are kept (brokerage, Roth IRA, rollover IRA).

For some reason, Invesco told me and Vanguard that I needed to get the distribution form signed by the person who opened the account for me - a financial advisor from Ameriprise I hadn't spoken to in 15 years.

I got the old FA on the phone, we got Invesco on the phone, and we went through their Solo 401(K) distribution form together. I filled it out the way I was told, signed and sent off to Invesco. They processed it rather quickly, and in a week I had a check, in my name, minus a 20% Federal withholding. The FA knew my intention was to roll it into my Vanguard IRA.

I've been on the phone with Invesco twice since I caught this and they say that there is nothing they or I can do. They've closed my 401(K) so they cannot just cancel the check and offer me a do-over.

So what I can do now? What will my tax implications be for this year? I'm in the 24% tax bracket, they withheld 20%, so will I owe another 4% or more come tax time? More? What about an early withdrawal penalty? Do I have any options to avoid these losses or undo what has been done? I don't want or need this money for another 15-20 years...",finance
personalfinance,What are the arguments around how fast to pay off a mortgage?,"I bought a townhouse a few months ago and am now in the position where I can afford to put a little more towards the mortgage, and so I'm wondering under what circumstances this would be a good idea or a bad idea.

It's a 5 year fixed rate mortgage with a 25 year amortization. Interest rates are low (and dropped right before we closed which was a nice bonus). Obviously I have no idea what rates will look like in 5 years but it seems unlikely to me they would be meaningfully lower. So does it make sense to pay off as much as I can while rates are low to limit the damage if rates go up later, or to take advantage of the extra money each month and invest it somewhere else for the next 5 years?

My monthly payments are ~$2600 and my interest rate is ~2.4%.

I just got my official pre-approval for a home mortgage today at $260,000. The house we are interested in is listed at $218,000 but we believe we can get it for around the $180,000-$200,000 mark.  


My credit score is 671. My yearly income is $100,000. I have $13,000 set aside for a downpayment. I'm working with Movement Mortgage, there's a local agent here who seems very friendly and knowledgable, but I wanted to ask a few questions to get some further insight.  


We were given several different loan options with another arising today. The first was a conventional, then the FHA, and then the VHDA (I'm located in Virginia) because this particular property lands in a federally targeted area.   


My questions are as follows:  


We contacted the listing agent and got a tour of the home. Do I need to get my own real estate agent outside of her to work with or is that good enough? For some insight, the agent suggested that we come in around $180,000 to $190,000.  


Do I need my own lawyer? And if so, how soon should I be getting one?  


How do I negotiate a good deal? Assuming the prices listed above are for comparable homes sold in the area (I also have the county records for tax assessments and a ""market value"" from the same counties website for 2017).  


Is it actually possible to close everything and move in within 6-8 weeks? I was told that Movement Mortgage works pretty quickly. I started the whole process yesterday afternoon and have already been preapproved so I'm assuming that's a good turnaround?

What is ultimately the best type of mortgage? Advantages and disadvantages of conventional vs FHA vs VHDA? Knowing that I qualify for each, which is the smarter way to go?

It's my first car so I probably haven't been treating it quite as well as I should have, though I've kept up pretty well with routine maintenance. Last year I spent about $2000 on it last year on replacing the radiator support (salvage title - guess they forgot to put it in when they were rebuilding it), AC condenser, coolant sensor, and oil pan. Then this year I've already had to fix the AC again, replace the alternator, replaced the shocks, fixed an oil leak, and replaced the serpentine belt twice after it broke because of a loose belt tensioner. I went to a mechanic 2 weeks ago because of some noise from the engine and they said I would need to replace the timing chain, which would be $2300.

At this point I'm pretty fed up with something big going wrong with my car every year. I'm a broke college student at the moment, so I was thinking of getting an old Honda or something that would hopefully have cheaper problems and just drive my car until it dies or I graduate and can afford to really fix it. I love this car, but it keeps having expensive problems. But any car within my budget (2500) would probably also have problems. I'm not really mechanically inclined, but are these normal problems to have? Should I keep trying to fix it? Or just go for the old beater? I'll probably keep my car either way, since it's not worth much as a salvage title so maybe I should just drive it until it breaks?

stocks,Read 'The Intelligent Investor' &amp; Sold my Portfolio,"I just finished reading '*The Intelligent Investor*' from Benjamin Graham. Afterwards, I tried my best to put Graham's advice into practice and analysed my portfolio thoroughly. As a sidenote, my portfolio was all US stocks (50% NASDAQ-100 and 50% single tech stocks as AMD, NVID, AMZN, ...). I looked at the balance sheets of the respective companies for the first time, with Graham's words in the back of my mind. After 2 days of analysis, I decided that none of my holdings is worth to hold at its current price. Sure, all of them are really good companies with great future prospects, but they are simply way too overpriced.

One sentences from Graham sticked to my mind the most:

**The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.**

That sentence really hit me. It reminded me of the unrealistic optimism among todays ""investors"" that is most embodied in meme sentences like ""stonks only go up"", ""buy the dip"", and so on and so forth. It really made me realize that this whole game is really just nothing but a game anymore, pure speculation from people relying on the FED to keep their gains growing for another couple of month, before eventually everything has to fall apart.

I think selling my positions was the right move as the market seems to be unsustainable and flooded by optimists these days. I know, timing the market is not Graham's advice either, but he certainly does not recommend a ""never sell anything and always try to buy the dip after a 5% correction"" strategy that most people promote on reddit these days. I feel smart and reliefed after selling to optimists.

&amp;#x200B;

* Today, we reveal why we believe Nikola is an intricate fraud built  on dozens of lies over the course of its Founder and Executive Chairman  Trevor Milton’s career.
* We have gathered extensive  evidence—including recorded phone calls, text messages, private emails  and behind-the-scenes photographs—detailing dozens of false statements  by Nikola Founder Trevor Milton. We have never seen this level of  deception at a public company, especially of this size.
* Trevor  has managed to parlay these false statements made over the course of a  decade into a \~$20 billion public company. He has inked partnerships  with some of the top auto companies in the world, all desperate to catch  up to Tesla and to harness the EV wave.
* We examine how Nikola  got its early start and show how Trevor misled partners into signing  agreements by falsely claiming to have extensive proprietary technology.
* We  reveal how, in the face of growing skepticism over the functionality of  its truck, Nikola staged a video called “Nikola One in Motion” which  showed the semi-truck cruising on a road at a high rate of speed. Our  investigation of the site and text messages from a former employee  reveal that the video was an elaborate ruse—Nikola had the truck towed  to the top of a hill on a remote stretch of road and simply filmed it  rolling down the hill.
* In October 2019, Nikola announced it  would revolutionize the battery industry. This was to be done through a  pending acquisition, but the deal fell through when Nikola realized (a)  the technology was vaporware and (b) the President of the battery  company had been indicted months earlier over allegations that he conned  NASA by using his expense account to procure numerous prostitutes.
* Nikola  has never walked back claims relating to its battery technology.  Instead, Trevor continued to publicly hype the technology even after  becoming aware of the above issues. The revolutionary battery technology  never existed – now, Nikola plans to use GM’s battery technology  instead.
* A spokesman for Volvo spin-off Powercell AB, a hydrogen  fuel cell technology company that formerly partnered with Nikola,  called Nikola’s battery and hydrogen fuel cell claims “hot air”.
* In  addition to now using GM’s battery technology, Nikola seeks to use the  automaker’s production and fuel cell capabilities. Nikola seems to be  bringing nothing to the partnership but concept designs, their brand  name and up to $700 million they will be paying GM for costs related to  production.
* Inexpensive hydrogen is fundamental to the success  of Nikola’s business model. Trevor has claimed in a presentation to  hundreds of people and in multiple interviews to have succeeded at  cutting the cost of hydrogen by \~81% compared to peers and to *already be producing hydrogen*. Nikola has not produced hydrogen at this price or at *any* price as he later admitted when pressed by media.
* Trevor  has appointed his brother, Travis, as “Director of Hydrogen  Production/Infrastructure” to oversee this critical part of the  business. Travis’s prior experience looks to have largely consisted of  pouring concrete driveways and doing subcontractor work on home  renovations in Hawaii.
* Claims of owning energy producing assets  is not new for Nikola. Trevor claimed that Nikola’s headquarters has 3.5  megawatts of solar panels on its roof producing energy. Aerial photos  of the roof and later media reports show that the supposed panels don’t  exist.
* At one point Nikola claimed to own its own natural gas  wells. There is no evidence in company filings to support this. The  claims were eventually quietly removed from Nikola’s website.
* Trevor  claims Nikola designs all key components in house, but they appear to  simply be buying or licensing them from third-parties. One example: we  found that Nikola actually buys inverters from a company called  Cascadia. In a video showing off its “in-house” inverters, Nikola  concealed the Cascadia label with a piece of masking tape.
* In a  July 2020 podcast, Trevor said of Nikola’s “Tre” truck: “We have five of  them coming off the assembly line right now in Ulm Germany.” A  spokesperson for Bosch, the manufacturing partner building the trucks,  confirmed this month that they haven’t made any trucks yet.
* The  company’s Nikola One “reveal” was a total farce. We corroborate  Bloomberg’s earlier work debunking Trevor’s claims regarding its  semi-truck that “this thing fully functions and works…this is a real  truck” and provide new evidence.
* We present behind-the-scenes  photos showing that Nikola had an electricity cable snaked up from  underneath the stage into the truck in order to falsely claim the Nikola  One’s electrical systems fully functioned.
* We learned through  emails and interviews with former partners that Trevor had an artist  stencil “H2” and “Zero Emission Hydrogen Electric” on the side of the  Nikola One despite it having no hydrogen capabilities whatsoever; it was  built with natural gas components.
* We also present evidence  that subsequent “reveals” were fictitious. In 2019, Nikola revealed a  “next generation” version of its off-road vehicle. We learned that it  was scrapped within weeks of the unveiling due to manufacturing  challenges. The redesign work was then quietly outsourced.
* Nikola’s  much-touted multi-billion dollar order book is filled with fluff. U.S.  Xpress reportedly accounts for a third of its reservations, representing  \~$3.5 billion in orders. U.S. Xpress had only $1.3 million in cash on  hand last quarter.
* Nikola’s key partners and backers have been  cashing out aggressively. Worthington, Bosch and ValueAct have all sold  shares. Worthington sold $237 million shares over a 2-day span in July  and another $250 million in August. We think they know exactly what type  of company Nikola is, and we expect that as Nikola’s GM “partnership”  boosts the stock price, key holders will continue to exit.
* We  think Trevor Milton, through dozens of outright lies, was able to form  partnerships with some of the largest legacy auto companies in the world  in their desperation to catch up to Tesla’s EV leadership status.
* Trevor  has ensured he is not going down with the ship.  He cashed out $70  million around the IPO and amended his share lock-up from 1-year to 180  days. If he is fired, his equity awards immediately vest and he is  entitled to collect $20 million over two years. Milton has laid the  groundwork to extract hundreds of millions from Nikola years before ever  delivering on his promises.
* Every now and then a story comes  around that exposes how little the “experts” really know. Theranos inked  partnerships with Walgreens, Safeway, and Cleveland Clinic and staffed  its board with luminaries. We think Nikola’s partners did not do their homework

investing,Read 'The Intelligent Investor' &amp; Sold my Portfolio Afterwards,"I just finished reading '*The Intelligent Investor*' from Benjamin Graham. Afterwards, I tried my best to put Graham's advice into practice and analysed my portfolio thoroughly. As a sidenote, my portfolio was all US stocks (50% NASDAQ-100 and 50% single tech stocks as AMD, NVID, AMZN, ...). I looked at the balance sheets of the respective companies for the first time, with Graham's words in the back of my mind. After 2 days of analysis, I decided that none of my holdings is worth to hold at its current price. Sure, all of them are really good companies with great future prospects, but they are simply way too overpriced.

One sentences from Graham sticked to my mind the most:

**The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.**

That sentence really hit me. It reminded me of the unrealistic optimism among todays ""investors"" that is most embodied in meme sentences like ""sto\*\*s only go up"", ""buy the dip"", and so on and so forth. It really made me realize that this whole game is really just nothing but a game anymore, pure speculation from people relying on the FED to keep their gains growing for another couple of month, before eventually everything has to fall apart.

I think selling my positions was the right move as the market seems to be unsustainable and flooded by optimists these days. I know, timing the market is not Graham's advice either, but he certainly does not recommend a ""never sell anything and always try to buy the dip after a 5% correction"" strategy that most people promote on reddit these days. I feel smart and reliefed after selling to optimists.

What do you guys think? Did I made a foolish move based on outdated knowledge? Will I get the opportunity to buy from pessimists in the next two years?",finance

We net about $6500 a month after taxes, insurance and investing about 8% of my $71K salary (8% match) in a 401K.

Anyone use money markets or other storage options that yield a higher return than a savings account but also provide some liquidity (get money out within a week with no penalty or fee)? I want to AT LEAST outearn inflation, which realistically is higher than the 2% the FED claims.

Right now, I am not at the point of being able to max out an IRA for my wife and myself, and have a comfortable 6 month savings (total savings need is about 13K and that's included in the 26K we have), but I also don't want my money sitting around doing a whole lot of nothing.

personalfinance,Retirement Account Advice - Choices for the first time in my life!,"I've recently accepted a job that offers multiple retirement plans and I'm spoiled for choice. I've never had options before and I don't know if my read of the situation is correct. The plans are as follows:

(1) State retirement and pension system with a mandatory 7% contribution from me.

Pros as I see them - guaranteed 5% interest each year, payments for as long as I live

Cons as I see them - must stay in the job 25 years to be vested (I'd be 62, which isn't terrible), federal tax is deferred on my contributions so I think that means I'd have to pay it when I start getting payments, it's a pension and I've heard horror stories about pension mismanagement and people losing everything

(2) 401(k) with 7.25% contribution from the organization.

Pros as I see them - pretty good contribution whether or not I contribute (Note: I WILL contribute the max I'm allowed), immediately vested

Cons as I see them - not guaranteed interest since it's based on the market, payments end when money ends

Additional info - I can choose either Fidelity or TIAA for the 401(k). Not sure which is better or if it matters.

My questions to you, personal finance, are these: If I have the option of a pension plan should I take it? Would I be crazy not to? If pensions aren't a good option, which 401(k) do I go with? Fidelity or TIAA?",finance

investing,"Why Interest Rates Matter, or 40 Years of Monetary Stimulus, or Why Inflation Could Collapse the Global Economy","In theory, a house buyer establishes what they can pay on a monthly basis and backs into a purchase price. The higher the rate, the lower the purchase price must be in order to afford the house. In other words, the general market for housing is a combination of house value and prevailing interest rates. As of 2020-09-03, the Fed pegs the 30 year fixed mortgage rate at 2.93%, the lowest since they began tracking the data in 1971.

For a $500,000 house, 20% down, 3.00% interest rate, a buyer could expect to pay $1,686.42 for principal and interest. If the same buyer was able to get a rate 0.25% lower (2.75%), they could have the same monthly payment on a house worth $516,366.37, or 3.27% more. At a 0.00% interest rate, the house would be worth $758,887.26, or 51.78% more. The curve looks like this ([House Price to Interest Rate](https://imgur.com/a/0gyNqCv)).

For historical context, we experienced serious inflation in 1980 ([US CPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA)), and nominal interest rates adjusted to accommodate the decreasing value of the dollar. Real US interest rates typically live between 0% and 3% ([Real US Interest Rates](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2016/real-interest-rates-over-the-long-run)).

All asset prices have to adjust to interest rates over time in a competitive market that is supposed to allocate dollars to the most efficient use. A higher interest rate curve necessitates a higher return on assets, which would mean current asset prices have to fall. For context in the housing market, to maintain the same monthly payment based on historical nominal 30 year fixed mortgage rates, a house with peak 1980 interest rates ([Historical 30 Year Fixed Rates](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=NUh)) would need to buy today's $500,000 house for $107,235.41, or a 73% discount to today's prices ([Today's $500k Home with Historical Mortgage Rates](https://imgur.com/a/7WnREh9)).

The biggest risk we face today is inflation. While we have seen the willingness of investors to take negative interest rates, historically that is unlikely to persist. Inflation of even 5% would likely mean mortgage rates of at least 5%, which would cause at least a 22% decrease in housing prices from today, all else equal. Apply a similar relationship across the board, domestically and internationally, and you would see the greatest destruction of wealth in history. With little room left for nominal and real rates to fall globally (in theory), unprecedented central bank spending, and concepts like MMT being thrown around as possible paths going forward, the risk reward distribution looks incredibly skewed.",finance
personalfinance,How soon can I refinance my first home after closing on a second?,"Hi all, 

Long time lurker, hoping to gain your advice on the question posed in the title. I have a primary residence purchased with VA loan that had been a rental property for the past few years. I moved around a lot with the military but am currently settled for the next few years. I shopped around for a home and was able to close on one (30 yr conventional at 2.875% fixed interest; 700k property with 20% down). 

Now I'm hoping to take advantage of the low interest rate and refinance my VA loan through IRRRL streamline refinance. I initially was not looking at it as the first mortgage officer I approached (who doesn't specialize in VA loan) told me that I can only refinance as a primary residence for VA loans. But doing a bit more research, it looks like it actually is possible although it might be at the cost of a higher interest rate than the typical IRRRL.  

The VA loan is 30 year fixed at 3.75% which isn't terrible, but with the low cost of refinancing through an IRRRL, I believe it would be worth pursuing. 

Is there any time period I should wait before trying to refinance my VA loan? Would it be worth it? Thank you all for the help.",finance

personalfinance,Help choosing big name bank or Online lender offering similar rate for refinancing a home,"I bought my home (new property) 2 years ago and got a 4+ rate, for a 30 year conventional mortgage loan. That rate was competitive at the time. I went with the builder's lender as it made more sense to me but they ended up selling the loan to a big name bank (BNB).

I requested a refinance analysis with BNB and they came up with a lower interest rate, in the lower 3% range for a 30 year conventional loan. No points. appraisal waived and reasonable closing costs (shy of 5k). My actual credit scores are above 740 at the moment, based on they told me.  I applied with BNB with my wife as co-borrower and they told me her credit was lower than mine (low 700s) but that they still gave me a rate as it was only me applying although she was still in the application. 

This new rate is an improvement from what I had but I still did my due diligence an shopped with a credit union, a couple of online lenders and a broker.

One of the online lenders gave me a mid 2% range for the same loan products (30 year fixed). No points, shy of 1k lender credit, closing cost close to 5k and appraisal waived. I applied for this without my wife as co-borrower. What caught my attention was that the Loan Estimate (LE) showed the property value at about 140% of market value (based on recent sales of similar properties in the neighborhood). The loan officer explained that they have a way to get the value of the property set to a max number based on data they have of the zip code, etc. , and that this was a way for them to reduce the rate even more.

Question 1 :
Is the large estimated property value a common practice? I don't want to get in trouble

I sent the LE from the online lender to BNB and they matched the rate. Used the same estimated property value and rolled the closing costs into the loan (same as the online lender). They are asking me to buy a tenth of a point and closing costs end up larger by about .2k. They told me that the rate was only valid today.. (I do not like being rushed like that).


Question 2(Main question)
Should  I go with BNB and eat up the  extra 2k  or with the online lender?

By the way, BNB expects to have the loan completed in 75-90 days and the online lender said 30-45 days. Both of them have mentioned that they intend to keep the loan. I am shaving about 2% from my previous rate.


Pros or BNB:
-I am familiar with them and have had no issues with them so far.
-Reputation preceeds them. Mental peace.
-They want to keep the loan.

Cons for BNB:
-Higher closing costs based on LE (1.5k).
-Slower processing time.
-They are rushing me to make a decision today.
-I don't feel ethical to simply get it to the big guy after the online lender pretty much made all the work to get the rate down and BNB copy/pasted it .It just does not feel right but then again, this is a rational decision and feelings should are not as relevant?

Online lender Pros:

-They initially worked out a great rate for me. I trust the loan officer. 
-Cheaper closing costs.
-Faster processing time.
-I have already submitted all documentation to them and we are just waiting to see if there is any impound.

Online lender cons:

- Paranoia of dealing with online lender vs a big name company. 
-They intend to keep the loan but it is more likely for them to sell it compared to BNB.

Extra question:
In case I go for BNB. Should I keep my wife on the loan or do it by myself?


Thanks and sorry for the long post. 


TLDR: Got a great refinance rate with an online lender and my current lender (big name bank, BNB)  matched the rate with slightly higher closing costs and needing a tenth of points purchased.  Help me make a responsible  and informed decision.",finance
personalfinance,"If you haven't filed your US Federal tax return yet because you owe and can't pay, file it by September 14 to avoid the higher late-filing penalty.","Taxpayers who owe tax and file their federal income tax return more than 60 days after the deadline will generally face a higher late-filing penalty. Ordinarily, the late-filing penalty, also known as the failure-to-file penalty (FTF), is assessed when a Taxpayer fails to file a tax return or request an extension by the return due date. This penalty, which only applies if there is unpaid tax, is usually 5 percent for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late.

If a tax return is filed more than 60 days after the July due date -- or more than 60 days after the October due date if an extension was obtained -- the minimum penalty is either $435 or 100 percent of the unpaid tax, whichever is less. This means that if the tax due is $435 or less, the penalty is equal to the tax amount due. If the tax due is more than $435, the penalty is at least $435. The late-filing penalty will stop accruing once the taxpayer files a complete and correct return.

The FTF penalty does not apply to the Taxpayers who met this year’s July 15 deadline to file their individual tax return. It also won’t apply to the Taxpayers who asked the IRS for a six-month extension of time to file, as long as they file by Oct. 15, 2019.

In addition, the IRS urges Taxpayers to pay what they owe to avoid additional late-payment penalty and interest charges. The late-payment penalty, also known as the failure-to-pay penalty (FTP), is usually 0.5% of the unpaid tax for each month or part of a month the payment is late. Interest, currently at the rate of 5 percent per year, compounded daily, also applies to any payment made after the original July 15 deadline.

After a return is filed, the IRS will figure the penalty and interest due and bill the taxpayer. Normally, the taxpayer will then have 21 days to pay any amount due: https://www.irs.gov/individuals/understanding-your-cp14-notice

If you are claiming a refund on your federal return and filing late, there is generally no penalty or interest charge.

* I have just shy of 50k in my 401k and have been contributing 13% .
* I have contributed $7,438.38 YTD.
* I have $12,679.38 in CC debt.
* I have $3,824.19 left on a personal loan for my car.
* ($16,503.57 Total)

I originally bought my car with cash, but was not wise with my student loans when I was young (aka I took a bunch more than I needed). I had interest rates on various student loans from 5% - to one was over 25%. I talked to a credit union and they were able to consolidate, but some of it they had to put in CC, and the other was the personal loan.

I won't go into the personal reasons that got the extra on my CC, but I am sitting in a much better place now. My credit score is not fantastic right now, so part of the reason I wanted to get rid of all of this was to be able to get that raised before I try to eventually buy a house and ""grow up"".

I've been paying this stuff off, and can healthily afford to put $500-$700 down a month on it all. When (if ever) does it make sense to use my 401k and get rid of all of my debt/interest, and start putting that money back into savings and my 401k?

Thank you so much!!

investing,Quick question regarding 10 year treasury yields,"So late last year, the big news was the yield curve inverting and the 10 year treasury dropping closer and closer to 1.0%. I understand we are now in an unprecedented crisis and that the Fed has taken unprecedented actions, why does this seemingly no longer matter? Why aren't people talking about it? Why aren't news reporting it? Not only is it under 1.0%, but it's been under 0.75% for the better part of 6 months now. Is the stock market just shrugging this off? Hasn't the Fed effectively shoved everyone into equities instead of bonds? Won't there be a terrifying reckoning?",finance

I know that between local, state, and federal taxes, a good rule of thumb is to set aside ""50%"" for taxes. Do I set aside 50% of that $40 I actually make, or 50% of the total $70 I charge? I can't make sense of it.

Like if I charged $40 for it and made $10, it wouldn't make sense to have to pay $20 for taxes, so each one I make would end up \*costing me\* $10, right? Or is that how it works?

stocks,"PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 10, 2020 Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 10, 2020**

Stocks traded choppily through the session before turning sharply red near close, with big tech stocks losing steam after a brief rally yesterday. Shares of Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), Facebook (FB), and more down more than 2.5%. As of close, the Nasdaq is down 10% from its highs this week, sending it firmly into correction territory.

The Nasdaq finished 2% down, the S&amp;P 1.7% down, and the Dow 1.4% down. Precious metals, including miners, were also down (GDX 1.96% down, Gold 0.32%, and Silver 1.11% down).

The recent volatility and uneasiness in the market came directly after its best month in decades, with analysts arguing that big tech stocks were overstretched and were due for a pullback. Alastair Pinder, global equity strategist for HSBC said, “Signs of uneasiness and stretched positioning in the options market have been visible in recent weeks, with the put/call ratio collapsing, an extremely steep front-end VIX term structure, and unprecedented volumes of options traded in tech companies, particularly calls,”. Option volume in FAANGM stocks is up almost 3x when compared to the beginning of the year ($200B in volume/day in August compared to $70B in January).

Back in May, the House of Representatives passed a $3 trillion bill, which the Republicans rejected and counterproposed with a $1 trillion bill. The Democrats offered to compromise and reduce to $2.2 trillion, but that offer was also rejected. Congress then went into recess until this week. Today, Senate Democrats rejected the Republican’s latest stimulus bill, valued at $500B, with a 52-47 vote, saying the legislation didn’t even come close to providing the level of support needed during this unprecedented pandemic. Every Republican senator except Rand Paul (KY) voted for the bill, while the Democrats unilaterally opposed. The bill included liability protections, enhanced unemployment benefits of $300/week, an extension to the Paycheck Protection Program that provides small business loans, and money for additional testing, school and state reopenings, and vaccine distribution plans.

In other news, ECB head Christine Lagarde has stated that it is likely they will use the full extent of the €1.35 Trillion euros in planned stimulus support.

investing,Buffet Forbes article from 1999,"Recently came across an interesting article from Buffet. He mentioned this in his 2000 annual letter. In short, Buffet argues that in order two enjoy double digit returns (as seen from 1982 to 1999), two things must happen. 1. Interest rates must fall; and 2. Corporate profits as percentage of GDP must increase. Given that interest rates are already at 0 and corporate profits are declining, we should temper our expectations for next 10 year returns. We can expect 4% - 6% in aggregate instead of 8% - 10%. 

What do you think about this?

I am 20 years old and making around 110,000 a year before taxes. I just purchased a house, and I currently drive 2 cars. To give some insight one was a $55,000 car that I put $15,000 down on and currently owe $40,000. The interest rate was a 5.3%. The other car was only $15,000 and I put $7500 down. Interest rate on this one was 4%. I purchased this one a couple days ago. 

I have enough money in my emergency savings to last me 1 full year if anything happens with my job. But I am wondering if I should use some of that and pay off my more expensive car because of its interest rate. I would be “saving” roughly $700/M that I could put away in my investment account. I’m honestly kinda stuck on what to do. 

I also been thinking about taking some of that money and putting it into a S&amp;P 500 verse my interest savings account. I just feel like it sitting there not making me money really bothers me. It’s nice to know I have it but it isn’t growing if you guys understand.

personalfinance,Mortgage refinance - am I crazy?,"I’m pretty sure my wife is about to cost us ~$83,000

Maybe I’m crazy, but I’m hoping one of you can help me figure out why. A conversation over dinner with my wife about refinancing for a lower rate ended up with her saying “I wish I never asked you about this, I’ll just handle it myself”

For reference, not that it really matters, the mortgage is 100% in my wife’s name and I am not currently listed as a coborrower so she is in the drivers seat. My credit score now is actually higher (720) but when we originally bought in 2014 I was recovering from a financially awful divorce. 

In 2014 we bought a house for $400,000 with a $100,000 down payment (no PMI) at a 4.0% rate. With property taxes, payments were $2,200 a month but from day 1 we’ve paid $2,600 which cut our payoff date by 12 years.  So we were scheduled to be mortgage free in 2032. 

With rates dropping, she wants to refinance for a 15 year fixed rate of 2.6%. We owe $265,000 of principal. With property taxes, that makes our payment $2,540 and our payoff date will be 2035. 

In my mind the math is simple I don’t care that the refinance interest rate is lower. If we don’t refinance, we will have paid $2600 a month from 2014 until 2032 for a total of $561,600. If we do refinance we will have paid $2,600 from 2014-2020 and $2,540 from 2020-2035 for a total of $644,500.

I don’t care that the interest rate is lower, we end up paying the house off three years later for $83000 more. Am I missing something?!? She is certain that I’m an idiot and is going to refinance anyway.",finance
personalfinance,A few questions from someone with little financial knowledge,"Hello all, 

I’m hoping to gain some insight into my financial situation from those of you who have more knowledge/experience on the subject. I don’t intend on making any drastic decisions based on individual pieces of advice, but I would greatly appreciate a bit of direction. 

I’m 26, one year out of college, currently working as a bartender (had a salaried position directly out of school, but alas, the small company couldn’t afford to retain its marketing department). My student debt (~40k total- ~14k is private, the rest is federal and currently on an income-based repayment plan) is, without a doubt, paramount when it comes to getting my finances in order, but i’m managing the monthly payments for now. 

As of right now, I have about 10k in the bank, one credit card, and no issues with bad credit. I would estimate my monthly income at about 2k (rent usually comes out to ~900/mo with utilities). With all this on the table, I have a few questions:

1) I haven’t been utilizing my (Wells Fargo “Everyday”) savings account. Would looking into a HYSA be proactive, assuming I put ~3k in it?

2) Credit card: I’ve had my current Barclaycard (yikes) since I was 18. The interest rate is garbage (~23%, I think) and I’m thinking of cancelling it. What’s a solid credit card option I should pursue (cash back, benefits, etc)? Should I get rid of my current card or just stop using it? I only have $50 on it and can pay it off at any point.

3) Investments? Follow-up Q to #1. I realize paying off my student debt is a priority, but I’m not exactly pulling in a significant, sustained amount of money (compared to a salaried position). Assuming I can keep up my monthly payments, is there anything worth investing in that would benefit me right now? 

Again, any advice is appreciated. I would just like to be more financially savvy by the time I hit 30.",finance
personalfinance,Question about student loans,"Hey all, 

Don't know if this question is appropriate for this sub, but I figured I'd try. I'm wondering if anyone knows anything about whether it's wise to repay old student loans with new student loans? 

Prior to COVID, I took out 40k in student loans with interest rates between 6% to 7% through the government. Since then, I've paid tuition with cash, even though I've had the option to take out loans.

Since COVID has reduced federal student loan interest rates, I'm wondering if I should take out new loans to repay the old loans. Current rates range from 4.30 percent to 5.18 percent. Origination fees are between 1% and 4%.

The loans have a payback period of 10 years.

personalfinance,401k Loan Withdrawal,"So.  This is my plan.  You could directly change the course of history - My history anyway.  Am I insane to do this?  I'm in my mid 30s.

I've already spoken with my 401k provider.
I'd take out 45k.  About 10k of that goes to uncle sam.

Use 10k of withdrawal to pay off cc debt (0% bal transfer expiring q4 '21).  Only debt and is from family illness a few years back.  I bounce it around every year to keep 0%.
Use the remainder (25k) to assist in buffer for 20% on down payment (targeting 500-550k).  Have 120k liquid.  Thinking movers, closing costs, painters etc.

VS

401k loan at a 4% interest rate for roughly ~800/month for 5 years.  I could do this, but I'd have to stop my existing 401k contribution entirely to cover.  If I stop contributions I lose out on employee match.

My reasoning for leaning towards withdrawal: the area we are looking for, pre-covid, saw house prices increased ~4% from 2010-2018 using a federal website that allows charting.  It's only gone up so since then.  Also, I'd still be able to contribute to my 401k and get company match.  I'd have the withdrawn amount back in in 3.5 years.  Yes, I'd lose out on compound interest.  My thought process is that compound interest would be gained in house appreciation instead.

I'm going to do this.  Now's your chance to change my mind.",finance
personalfinance,29 - 4 year goal,"Preface - Hey all, so my wife (28), I (29) my little one (1 1/2) have a goal to make an across country move to get closer to family.  Leading up we would like to save a sizable amount to help us pay for a down payment on our future home (without having to rely on the sale of our current house).  

At the moment we have a good chunk of cash right now that I recently acquired from a sale of some previous assets I had and am sitting on about 50k in cash (which includes 10k in an emergency fund).  The dilemma I am facing is if I should pay off some debt (we have a 160k mortgage, 15k car loan, and wife has 28k student loans) or invest a majority of that money to help grow our nest egg and make the move financially easier in the future.  Right now I’m the only income since we decided that mom wanted to stay home a few years.  She’s also going back to school right now which is about 2k a semester.  Before she stayed home we were making combined about 100k a year.  My income is about 70k right now give or take if I work overtime (haven’t been as much since having a little one, a wife with medical problems, and 16 hr shifts suck). In a year and a half I will be making closer to 80k. Originally we had decided we were going to pay off her student loans but then the pandemic hit and interest rates went to zero so we stopped paying on them so we could grow our emergency fund more (which we did).  Well now we’re kind of just sitting in limbo with 40k in my checking and 10k in savings debating what to do with it.  Would I be better off paying off some debt or invest it?   The only thing that concerns me about investing that money right now is the volatility of the market.  I’ve a high risk tolerance when it comes to my retirement accounts, but money we would plan on using as a means to purchase a home worries me a bit, even in an index fund.

personalfinance,Should I pay off slowly and invest or pay off student loans first?,"I currently have $185k in federal loans at anywhere from 6.5-7.9%. I’m wondering what your thoughts are between the following options:

1. 10 year payoff at $2000/mo, keeping it through federal loans to keep the potential of future student loan forgiveness in play.
2. 10 year payoff but refinance at ~4%, which would reduce monthly payments to ~$1875/mo, but would eliminate any potential student loan forgiveness or government programs.
3. 20 year PAYE program at ~$600/mo. This option would incur a tax bomb where the amount forgiven will be added to my income and taxed (I believe it will be around $100k). Use the difference of $1400 to invest in either index funds or real estate, hoping my ROI is higher than my student loan interest rate.

Both options 1 and 3 end up being roughly the same amount paid if my math is correct.

My main goal is to eventually achieve financial freedom, which is why option 3 is appealing even though it’s the riskiest.

investing,Fed bought high yield bond etf?,"On what day did they exactly announce this? I was looking through https://www.federalreserve.gov/default.htm and I couldn't find nothing about etf but treasury bond, corporate bond by themselves..
It's official. 
The Federal Reserve is now buying bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Specifically, as part of the stimulus effort to counteract the effects of the coronavirus lockdowns, the Treasury gave the Fed $75 billion, which the Fed will in turn leverage 10-to-1 to buy $750 billion in corporate debt. Some of that figure will be in the form of corporate bond ETFs and even junk bond funds.

The answer here is pretty simple. The Fed essentially has the same issue that other passive indexers do. They're looking to get exposure to the corporate bond market as a whole, but not necessarily to any single company. The Fed isn't a bond fund manager. Nor does it have the interest or the inclination to research the credit worthiness of individual bond issuers

investing,How does the fed buying MBS help?,"The Federal Reserve purchased $22.686 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) during the week from July 9 to July 15, up from its $21.685 billion in the previous week.

The New York Federal Reserve Bank announced the purchase, adding the central bank did not sell any of its MBS guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae during this period. In the previous week, the Fed sold $3.6 billion worth of MBS.

The Fed’s balance sheet has swelled from $4.2 trillion at the beginning of March to $7.2 trillion by mid-June. Bloomberg columnist Christopher Maloney observed that “volatility has plunged 67% from its decade-plus high seen before quantitative easing resumed March 16, and is now well below its trailing five-year average. That benefits MBS investors as the chance of a borrower having an incentive to refinance is in part a function of interest rate volatility over the life of the loan.”

Okay I understand if fed bought corporate bond, out of thin air, it inject liquidity to cycle thus make it easier for companies to borrow money thus stimulating economy.

I was previously paying about a $1000 a month to hopefully pay those down more quickly. The interest rates on the loans are between 5.5 and 6 %. On the 25 year repayment it would be $580 a month payment. But I can pay more to reduce interest and pay off more quickly 

Income
Me $130,000
Wife $100,000 

Other money and savings: 

Old 401k from previous job $24,000
Roth IRA ( from before I made above the income limit ) 14,000
Savings accounts $30,000
Checking account $10,000
Robinhood stocks $11,000
Traditional IRA - I put in $6000 for this for the first time this year

Debts
New car $20,000 0% interest
Credit card paid in full every month, at $1800 now
Student loans $60,000

I'm thinking of saving for a home ( 2BR condo), they cost around $500-600k in my city and I don't want to continue giving a landlord 2000-3000 a month for the rest of my life. 

I'm also thinking of buying into my company so I can have partial ownership of  there business that is doing very well. I will make more money if I own part of the company but it might cost me $100-$200k depending on how much of the clinic I want to own. 

Retirement- I have not actively put aside money for retirement for the last 8 months since leaving my old job with the 401k. My new boss is thinking of starting 401k eventually. 

My rent is lower than average ($2300) because of rent stabilization. 

If I can only put aside $6000 a year in an IRA, where should the rest of my money go? Keep building savings, pay off loan as fast as possible? Put more into investments? I tried talking to Fidelity and they told me to open a Traditional IRA but I can't put in more. Should I just find a good financial advisor? Do they do remote consultations?

personalfinance,Refinance Fees Likely To Increase Soon,"I am sure you may have heard the government is charging .5% on refinances. This is not to debate the validity of their reasoning, or the conservatorship of FNMA/FHLMC.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically for those of you who don't work in the finance industry, if you are refinancing and your loan is $250,000, FHFA is going to charge your bank $1,250. Banks aren't in the habit of losing money, so guess who is going to pay that fee? You are through a higher rate.

&amp;#x200B;

The fee doesn't officially kick in until December 1st, which is still 81 days away. However, the industry on the whole (mortgage companies, title attorneys, etc.) are above capacity. Smaller banks are taking about 45-60 days to do a loan with larger ones taking 90-120. This fee is also due when smaller banks sell your loan to a larger servicer, which takes another 30 days.

&amp;#x200B;

This doesn't mean you'll pay another .5% in interest rate - it'll likely be .125% - .25% higher, but if you can save $20 a month, why not? Basically, if you're on the fence, you need to get locked in to your refinance now because next week your rate will be higher.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT for Update - Pricing just came out - Refinance rates are .25% higher. Purchase rates remain unchanged.",finance
personalfinance,When will land prices ever come down?,"Finally feel like I am in a position financially (M45) to start looking to buy investment/recreational real estate.   I have no debt, mid six figure household income, well on way to retirement goals (max out 401k, HSA and 529s) with cash left to spare.   I am fortunate in that respect.   

I have been watching local real estate market for years and watched land prices continue to rise.   I live in Iowa and am interested in either recreational property to hunt on or combination productive ag land and rec ground.   

I am just continually confused and frustrated that this kind of land remains out of reach.   Commodity prices are terrible for last few years and economy is still on shakey ground.  Yet low interest rates and lack of supply seem to keep anything that does come up for sale at prices that don’t make sense to me.

I just wonder if I should continue to be patient.  What factors are out there that could cause this bubble to burst and how probable are they to happen?",finance
software,free opensource pdf editor?,"Libreoffice Draw is confusing to use, as well as scans and makes it text-box per line rather than per body (paragraph). Inkscape formats the document weirdly as well. And PDFEdit just gives the error that the pdf is a read-only document and does not allow me to edit it. 

I have found that PDF-Xchange Editor works for me, however it adds watermarks all the PDFs with the largest watermark I've seen, and isn't opensource.

Any suggestions on what I could use? 

EDIT: I need something that can highlight, make highlight comments, and make text boxes.",technology

personalfinance,Coming out of mortgage forbearance: Cap and extend modification vs Standard,"Coming out of mortgage forbearance:  

What is the difference between ""Cap and extend modification extension"" and ""Standard extension""

I was explained that it is not a balloon payment but extended over the same number of months that was missed, but the payments are calculated differently?  I was told ""Standard extension"" would result in a slightly lower payment.

If somebody can educate me that would be great.

Ideally, I'd like to add everything together and re-amortize with today's interest rate",finance

personalfinance,Purchasing Home from Landlord,"Hello PF:

My Fiancee and I were recently approached by our landlord regarding purchasing his rental property, where we live.  Our landlord has a potential opportunity to buy a commercial building and is wanting to do a 1031 exchange with the rental property we are currently living in.  Alternatively, if we do not want to purchase the home, he has no issue passing on the commercial opportunity, so the decision is in our court.

We live in one of the most expensive and fastest moving markets in the US (Westcoast).  Currently, our gross income is ~$210k.  I recently graduated, so I have minimal savings.  We have approximately $40k to put down.  Our landlord has offered to sell us the house we are renting for $600,000.  We are currently paying $2600 a month for rent.  We spoke with a few lenders, and it does not appear we'd have any issues getting a loan.  They advised we'd likely be looking at an interest rate between 2.75-3.5%. 
  
The home itself is a two-bedroom one-bath upstairs that is fully functional.  Meanwhile, the house's upside is in the unfinished downstairs, which has an additional 2-bedrooms and one-bath.  If finished, the property would likely rent in our area for around $3200-$3500. 

I have looked at the Zillow mortgage calculator to get an idea regarding our different options.  I had a friend do an appraisal on the house, and he appraised it at $550k, but he mostly does commercial real estate and acknowledges there is significant upside with the unfinished downstairs.  We also discussed that a lot of properties in the area have been going for above asking.

Our landlord said he'd take care of all the closing costs, and the agent would draft all of the necessary documentation for free.

My initial inclination is that I am unsure if we are ready to buy with such a minimal downpayment (PMI).  But, the upside is that we could work do work ourself on the property over the next two years or so and build substantial equity while doing so.  Additionally, I believe my earning potential can increase significantly over the next few years based on my career.  I lost my planned job due to COVID and ended up accepting ~20% less with my current job.  I'd greatly appreciate any thoughts regarding how we should proceed.

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,"New job, manipulative payment structure during training?","Started a new job a few weeks ago, I'll jump right into where it seems questionable payment by the employer, graphs of examples included.

Employer says: $500/week during training. For a 40 hour work week, this would be $12.50 per hour. Any hours worked over 40 (VERY much expected) are subject to overtime pay, but at a seemingly manipulative rate. They take total hours worked and figure out your hourly rate over that week from the $500/week. Then, they pay you time and a half of that rate for the extra hours.

E.g. Say I worked 50 hours last week. $500 / 50 = $10 per hour. $10 \* 1.5 = $15 per hour for the overtime hours, so $15 \* 10 = $150 for overtime. $650 for the week.

I've made some [graphs](https://imgur.com/a/yEBQw3O) to show how this doesn't really follow the federal law of overtime compensation of time and a half for working beyond 40 hours. One shows what a paycheck would look like with the described overtime structure in red, versus if I were payed the expected rate of $12.50 per hour in black. The other is the hourly rate for the whole paycheck, and shows how the hourly rate is manipulated, ultimately paying less after 60 hours than the original value of $12.50 per hour of standard 40 hour work.

Is this legal? Can they require me to work overtime, which is likely to approach or even pass that 60 hour threshold regularly, with this payment structure? If it has any relevance, the job is for blue collar commission work in Iowa (no commission earned during training), training consists of about half field shadowing (full employee gets all commission) and half online training modules.",finance

personalfinance,upfront discount for paying in full.,"Let's say you have two options. (1) pay in full and get 5% discount (2) pay in 10 monthly installments with no discount. Which one would you choose?

If we flip the equation and say either X\*0.95 OR pay 10 times X/10 and think of the additional 5% as interest it's equal to an annual interest rate of 11.3% (according to my calculation). Obviously, a 11.3% loan is crazy if I did my calculation correctly.

Before we go on... we'd like to send our respect and honor all those fallen and affected by the events that took place 19 years ago in New York. Our thoughts and prayers...

Today was tough, stocks again traded choppily today as market volatility continued. Tech shares continued to slide after last month’s historic rally. The S&amp;P and Dow finished slightly green, while the Nasdaq underperformed to finish firmly in the red.

The Dow led the session, finishing 0.47% up, the S&amp;P was 0.06% up and the Nasdaq underperformed, ending the day 0.69%. Precious metals were modestly up (Gold 0.11%, Silver 0.24%), but gold miners were firmly down (GDX 1.03% down)

The Nasdaq sank 1.4%, as the index was pressured by an ongoing rout in some of their most heavily weighed big tech shares. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped 1.35% and tracked toward a weekly loss of more than 8%. Amazon (AMZN) was down 1.85%, Microsoft (MSFT) was 0.56% down, Facebook was 0.55% down, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) was 0.73% down.

The New York Stock Exchange is signaling that it will move its electronic trading systems out of New Jersey if the state implements a proposed tax on financial transactions. The NYSE said it will run one of its exchanges from a backup site in Chicago for a week as a demonstration of its readiness to quit the state, according to a notice sent to clients, per the Wall Street Journal

The federal budget deficit surpassed $3 trillion through August, according to official Treasury data released Friday, and is expected to hit $3.3 trillion when the fiscal year wraps up at the end of this month. The figures, which confirm earlier estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), show that the deficit is on track to be the largest in the country’s financial history. The $3.3 trillion figure is well over double the largest previous record of $1.4 trillion in 2009, during the financial crisis. Meanwhile in congress hopes for a new stimulus are looking bleak for now.

I am here about the ""smaller"" debts, aka credit cards.  I was a bad spender and have 10k in various credit card debts.  My goal is to knock those debts out, then deal with refinancing and consolidating my student loans. So my income can handle it. 

I've paid off 4 cards so far(and kept them with 0 balance), and now I have 3 more.   With 1800, 2900, and 5600 as balances.  My idea was to pay off the smaller ones first , then take that money and start paying off the next card, etc to snowball the money into the larger amounts. My mom is telling me to go for the higher interest rate first. So far I've been snowballing because the amounts were under $1500. But now I'm down to these 3 and brainstorming again because it's a tougher decision.  Here is the details of each :

A- 1800, min monthly 56, interest 22.99
B- 2900, min monthly 86, interest 22.99
C- 5600, min monthly 174, interest 26.99


I want to pay off A, C, then B.  My mom is saying C, A, then B.  I want to do the smaller amount cause they will be quicker to payoff and I can then use that money towards the other cards, but I also know where my mom is coming from with high interest.  Any Advice?",finance
personalfinance,Can I refinance my car loan?,"Hi, I bought a car on May 30th with a total of $8438.33. The interest rate is 26.90% so I’m paying about $300 a month for a total of 39 months I believe. My credit score is quite low it’s at 569 Fido 8 score according to discovery and 553/543 on credit karma. I’m in the process of trying to raise it. Is it possible for me to refinance my car after 6 months or even with my credit score? I feel like even an interest rate of 17%  would be better than the one I have now.

I definitely won't miss the extra $2.5k down payment from my savings, but in theory I could also invest it and use any possible gains above the car loan interest rate towards the monthly, no?

I bought a house in 2019 for around 375k, currently owe 355k.  The house is valued at around 450(didn't use realtor and paid cash for a yard/etc).  I am a veteran and am able to do a cash-out refinance and pull out around 65000 and pay off the loans that are higher interest.  

House info:

Owe 355k, interest rate of 3% - matures 10/2049. Payment of 1687/month

Refinance rate - 2.25%, new 30 year term to mature in 10/2050.  Payment would be 1605/month.  The funding fee and other cash-out refinance fees would be 9400 that would be rolled back into the loan.  Is it worth it to refinance and cash out to pay down student loans?  My overall monthly payment would be less, but understand it would reset my amortization curve - just not sure what the right move is.  I currently contribute to a 401k/hsa/savings fund(emergency) - but only put in to 401k/hsa to get the employer match.  I have a few extra hundred dollars in my budget to make payments, but would love to get some of this debt rolled over to lower interest debt.  My loans are all government loans through Nelnet and are currently interest free, but ready to start tackling these or coming up with a plan.

My credit score and income have both increased since the purchase of this car so I'm hoping my interest rate will be much more reasonable, and I know my minimum payments will probably double, but someone else will be helping me pay for this new car as well, I'm just not sure which will be the better solution in the long run (even if I only have a few months left to plan)

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020.

# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**
*****
&gt; Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.
*****
&gt; But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.
*****
&gt; “The market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,″ she said. The Fed’s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market’s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it’s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market’s sell-off.
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. “I don’t think they’ll do anything to the markets either way,” he said.
*****
&gt; Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&amp;P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.
*****
&gt; Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed’s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.
*****
&gt; “We see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,” the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.
*****
&gt; Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. “The market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,” she said.
*****
&gt; BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.
*****
&gt; Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.
*****
&gt; “Depending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,” said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.
*****
&gt; “Our view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,” said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.
*****
&gt; “There is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,” said Krosby.
*****
&gt; Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it’s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.
*****
&gt; Chandler also noted the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.
*****
&gt; “My sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it’s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They’ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,” he said.
*****
&gt; Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we’re going to make new highs,” he said.

&gt; # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 1

&gt; First off, our thoughts go out to everyone who was impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001—19 years ago today. It is a day to reflect and remember those who were lost.

&gt; One of the top requests we’ve had here at LPL Research is for more charts on the election. Over the next week, we will share some of our favorite charts on this very important subject.

&gt; Here’s how the S&amp;P 500 Index performs under various presidents and congressional makeups. The best scenario has historically been a Democratic president and Republican Congress, while a Republican president and Democratic Congress has been the weakest.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Building on this, a split Congress historically has been one of the best scenarios for investors.

&gt; The best scenario under a Republican president is a split Congress, a potential positive for 2020 that has played out after the massive reversal in the stock market since March.

&gt; Looking at the four-year presidential cycle shows that stocks haven’t been down during a year the president was up for a re-election since FDR in the 1940s, another bullish tailwind for 2020.

&gt; Here’s another look at this, as stocks historically have done much better when there isn’t a lame duck president.

&gt; # Active Managers Do an About Face

&gt; The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.

&gt; This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&amp;P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?

&gt; # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000

&gt; Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.

&gt; At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.

&gt; With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.

&gt; There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).

&gt; One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.

&gt; These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&amp;P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**

&gt; Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.

&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).

&gt; Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).

&gt; While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!

&gt; # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates

&gt; While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL’s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.

&gt; “Even in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Among them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:

&gt; * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise—likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.
&gt; * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that’s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don’t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.
&gt; * **Don’t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.
&gt; * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.
&gt; * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.
With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.

&gt; # Best and Worst Performing Stocks Since the 9/2 High

&gt; Since the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq peaked on September 2nd, we've seen rotation out of the post-COVID winners and rotation into laggards in the value space. Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&amp;P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.

&gt; Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.

&gt; Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.

&gt; What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**

&gt; While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.

&gt; # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End

&gt; As of yesterday’s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&amp;P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today’s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&amp;P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.

personalfinance,"Help me understand bond funds, interest rates, and risk","1. Bond funds

So, I basically understand what a bond is. You buy a bond for X amount of money and if you hold it to maturity you get your money back plus interest. Bond funds are baskets of bonds that aren’t always held to maturity, have distributions each month or quarter, and have a share price that fluctuates in a narrow band (in the case of the Vanguard Massachusetts Tax-Exempt Fund (VMATX) the price is between $10 and $11.50). Looking at VMATX, the share price is currently near a 10-year high. The same is true for the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (VBTLX). I’m assuming the same is true for most bond funds right now, that they are at or near a 10-year high (correct me if I’m wrong, but if I am let’s just look at these two bond funds). So, why would someone buy into a bond fund when the share price is so high? Yes, you earn income from monthly distributions, but don’t you also risk losing money when the share price inevitable comes back down? What am I missing?

2. Interest rates and risk

The summary of VMATX states that the fund comes with “interest rate risk,” which the prospectus defines as “the chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates.” I understand what this means literally, but how does it affect the bond fund and how would it affect my returns? Maybe a lower share price and/or lower distributions?

I also understand (I think) that interest rates are currently low to help with the economic recovery and that they’ll remain low for the next few years. But what does this mean for the bond fund? How should I factor this into my future bond-related investments?

3. VMATX

The Vanguard Massachusetts Tax-Exempt Fund interests me for two reasons: it’s high returns and tax-exempt status. Since 1998, the average annual return is 4.54%, which I consider high compared to something like a money market fund or HYSA, and it’s exempt from both federal and Massachusetts personal income taxes. Side note: if this is the case, why does Vanguard provide returns for after taxes on distributions and sales of fund shares?

What are the main risks to a bond fund like VMATX? I get the sense that it’s relatively safe, somewhere between a money market fund and an S&amp;P index fund. Is that accurate? Do any of you invest in something like this? Why?

As I said, I’m interested in this fund, but I have no plans to currently invest in it, so this will just be knowledge for future use.",finance
personalfinance,(USA) Refinancing Student Loans - Variable or Fixed Interest Rate?,"So my parents and I didn't understand the student loan system when I first entered college and I took on a bunch of sallie mae loans instead of government loans.

I'm looking into refinancing the sallie mae loans cause they're all super high fixed interest rates (8.125% to 10.5%). I have paid off a good portion already but I figure I might be able to get a lower interest rate and make the payments easier by refinancing.

When I'm searching, should I go with a variable or fixed? 

I have a good credit score, over like 720 last I checked but I have no auto loan or mortgage history. It's all credit cards and interest and some principal payments on these student loans. I start my job in January and will have an income of over $60k that I can show.

The current balance on the debt is just over $16,500 and I've got some other government loans as well but those are much more manageable.

Appreciate any insight, thank you for the help!",finance
personalfinance,Switching to another bank,"Hi,

I have a checking account in Bank of America, together with a credit card they approved me. I hate this bank and I have the opportunity to open a checking account with better conditions in Navy Federal through my military spouse..

So, two questions:

1) If I close the Bank of America checking account, would that affect my credit score nwgatively?

2) I want to keep the credit card I have with Bank of America because I think if I get rid of it my credit scorw would be affected but, can I pay my monthly balance using the Navy Federal account? Would Bank of America charge me any fee if I pay the credit card using another bank?

Thank you",finance
personalfinance,Smaller interest rate or larger grant,"I'm not a math wiz and can't find a good calculator online.

My wife and I have $10,000 of our own money available for a down payment and we have a $4,000 grant (no payback requirements, literally treated as a gift).

We are looking looking to take out a mortgage around $240k. 30 yr fixed.

Loan #1: There is a loan officer estimating a 2.875% interest rate.

Loan #2: There is another loan officer estimating a 3% interest rate, but we would also qualify for another $4,000 through them (also treated as a gift, no payback requirements).

Which mortgage would be best for me based on those things alone. What would be the break even point as far as how long Loan #1 would be the best option for us vs loan #2. Assuming fees are the same on both. I assume Loan #1 is better if we end up moving within a certain amount of years, and Loan #2 would be better if we ended up staying there longer. What is that break even point?",finance
personalfinance,Purchase a home on low income advice,"Hey guys I'd like to see what you all think about my situation. I'm trying to figure out if I'm being unrealistic or if I should trust the numbers. As far as I can tell, I should be able to afford a low priced home of around 100k - 150k. After estimating and running some numbers, it would appear that I can afford it if I remain as frugal as I am now. Im working two jobs 72 hours a week with a very low income of $35,000 a year. 

Like I said, the numbers say that it's doable. 724 credit score, house hacking and religious adherence to taking advantage of all possible tax write offs and credits. 

The reason I'm doubtful is that my mother, who is absolutely brilliant (honestly a freak of nature), doesn't think it is viable given my income. I know that I would be right there on the edge in terms of stability. 

Here's the numbers:
Gross income $35,000

Car: 488 per month
Car Insurance: 150 per month
All other insurance: 133 per month
Food (at most): 280 per month
Spotify: 10 per month
Gas: 120 per month
Girlfriend/fun stuff: tough to estimate but I'd say less than $20 a week so 80 per month. 
Phone: 30 per month
Meds: 70 per month

Total per year: $12,972. 

Round up to 13,000 for the sake of the math and a margin of error and add 1000 for any unforseen major expenses. (Car maintenance, etc.)

As far as I can tell this is just about all I should be spending every month and I am able to do this consistently.  

$35,000 - $14,000 = $21,000 
I expect to pay right around $8k - $10k in state and federal taxes. 

$21,000 - $10,000 = $11,000. 

$11k saved up every year
 
Assuming I have a mortgage payment of $800 dollars and knowing that my income will be increasing periodically, it's going to be really close. Since the plan is to house hack with a duplex, if I do it correctly, which I shouldn't have any problems doing, then rent and hopefully utilities will be covered or relatively inexpensive. If I needed to, I could live rent free with my parents while the duplex cash flows with two tenants. 

Does anyone see and glaring holes in my reasoning? I know this is a rough outline of expenses that could vary throughout the year. I understand that the home will have the typical upfront costs, small renovations, closing costs, taxes and monthly insurance due to an fha loan. I do have plenty for a 3.5% down payment already saved up. 

Is this something I should consider taking on?",finance
personalfinance,I have been impacted by a wildfire in my area. Would I qualify for any special help when paying my mortgage?,"I live in the Almeda Fire area (Southern Oregon). My town was destroyed on Tuesday night. By miracle (and a shit ton of hard work by firefighters) my home was spared. Fire stopped 100 yards from my home. That said, it has no utilities. My job is impacted, I was only able to get 9 hours of work this week.  I'm living 45 minutes away. My mortgage is due in 3 days. 

Do I qualify for any extenuating circumstances for mortgage payments? Or are there any Federal or statewide benefits I could tap into? Thank you so much in advance.",finance
personalfinance,What would be my best options for financing a mobility scooter?,"Background: I am unable to drive a normal vehicle due to a disability, thus I do not possess a driver's license. 

Where I live, we have very limited public transportation, and it is not sufficient for me to get to work. I'm able to walk short distances but definitely not far enough to walk to work and back. Prior to COVID, I used Uber/Lyft to get to work (I actually only had the job for about half a year prior to COVID, and was considering alternative options already). With COVID, I've been able to work from home, but coming up soon there is a good chance I will need to start working in the office again. Uber and Lyft have become largely abandoned since COVID began (I can't remember the last time I was actually able to get a ride on either service). Ironically, our local cab service went out of business shortly after Uber/Lyft started up here, so we have no other options now. It's also an area of the US that gets VERY cold in winter (temperatures regularly below 20F, sometimes dipping to negatives).

To this end, I've been looking into getting one of these neat new enclosed mobility scooters. To clarify, these are the type similar to what you might find in your grocery or Walmart, but are larger and rated for all-weather use. They are classified as medical devices, and usually have a maximum running speed of around 8mph, therefore they are considered legal for sidewalk/bike lane use (essentially, you are classified as a pedestrian while using one). There are small low-cost non-enclosed scooters out there, but they are not weatherproof and can't be used in rain or snow. The enclosed models can come with heaters and wipers and are suitable for use in all weather. The problem is the cost - these devices start at around $7.5K and go up from there. 

Now to the financial question: I'd like to invest in one of these scooters. However, $7.5K is far too much for me to lay down all at once. The company does not offer any of their own financing. I already checked with my medical insurance and they will not cover it, as they only cover electric mobility devices if you cannot get around your home without it (I can get around my house just fine, it's long distance walking that I can't do).

I have two credit cards with a combined available credit of $20K, but I have always lived by the rule of ""if you can't pay cash, don't charge it"", so I've rarely paid interest to credit card companies. My credit score is around 710 (averages around there, depending on which service you ask). For housing, I live alone in a house owned by my mom and pay her the mortgage and property tax money (she purchased a new house with my dad due to her own disability), but my name is not on the mortgage (we've been considering how we might transfer the mortgage to me or add me as an owner at some point, but that's a separate issue). I don't belong to any credit union (nothing available through work, and honestly not too familiar with how they work outside of that context). The amount I could reasonably pay per month towards a loan/credit based on my budget is around $300. Thus, I calculate a 36 month loan would probably be the ideal time frame (7500 / 300 = 25 months, add in interest, so the payment will likely be around $250-275 for 36 months).

My question: Is there any way to get a *secured loan* (with the scooter itself as collateral)? I strongly doubt that an auto loan servicer would cover this, since it's not technically an automobile. An unsecured cash loan might work too, but I'm not sure if that'd have a higher interest rate. I could ask my mom about a home equity loan on my house, but the problem is since it's not in my name, it would not provide any benefit to my credit (I'd be paying her back for the loan and she would be paying the loan herself). Clearly credit cards are the worst option and I already ruled that out. It feels like the best option would be basically an ""auto loan"" but where the scooter is the collateral, similar to how a car is the collateral for an auto loan. Anyone know if this is something that is commonly done?

Basically, what is the best option for me to finance this type of purchase, that will give me the most benefits (e.g. credit improvement, lowest rates, etc.)?",finance
personalfinance,Private Student Loan (Navient) Discharge for closed scam schools,"Hello,

I'm looking for some advice regarding getting Student Loans discharged due to school closing due to fraud / investigations.

A while back, I attended a scam school. When they started getting investigated for fraud / scamming, they shut their doors and their parent company re-opened under a new name. When they continued to get investigated, they eventually shutdown completely.

I see my state has information for people who had government backed loans to get forgiveness if they had attended or recently attended those schools.

What I cannot find is information on private student loans and possible pathways toward getting those loans discharged. Whether it's something through State (Wisconsin) or Federal law that can be looked at.",finance
personalfinance,My disabled mother hasn't filed her taxes in 15 years and the IRS is trying to collect them. She won't talk to a professional about this because of costs. I desperately need help!,"**My mother hasn't filed her taxes in just shy of 15 years**.

She is currently disabled and owes out of state taxes to California. When she tried to file them, she found out that she apparently has to file for her federal back taxes as well to be able to fix those  (after procrastinating for like 2 weeks of the month they gave her to sort this out because the prospect of doing so stresses her out.). One of the key issues here is that she's currently disabled and the only money she has is from a lump sum of cash given to her when she was awarded disability. She's afraid of losing what will probably be the last nestegg she has since she is approaching 50 and has no savings. She also had to pay for her father's funeral last year this time and was just recently forgiven from her student debts.

We already live at the poverty line in low income housing, so this has the potential to be catastrophic. Is their some sort of hardship program or payment plan available to her instead of paying all at once? While I defiantly think she should have filed her taxes a long time ago before things got this bad, the situation is still extremely dire, especially considering the fact that we were planning to move out of the state next year and are stuck in an area and apartment we can already just afford (Texas).

If their is anyone who can provide resources or help in some way, please do so! I'm only 22, so I have no idea how any of this works aside from doing my own mundane personal taxes. I decided to not follow her example on this one, and I'm very glad for it, but she still needs some sort of aid in this situation, and she sees hiring a professional as just another expense, citing that ""no one is going to help her for free."" As a result, she hadn't talked to *anyone* qualified about this and I think she is just sort of giving up on the situation as a whole. Her depression issues are not helping this.

*TL:DR: My mother desperately needs professional help concerning her taxes, but won't even try to seek it out despite the fact that she had no idea what she is doing and is probably making things worse as a result because she amuses she can't afford help. So, I've turned to Reddit in the hopes that someone here can provide some sort of worth wild avenue I can use to try and advise her on these matters.*

If you need additional information, please don't hesitate to ask! Within reason, of course. I'm not sure what can be done, but there has to be *something* aside from giving over the last of her savings and being forced into even further poverty... right? I'm not going to say she shouldn't have filed them by now. I've been telling her to for a number of years. But it's caught up with her now and she's truly unable to handle it without someone more qualified to help her out.",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on refinancing a personal loan.,"Freedom Plus reached out to me to see if I wanted to refinance my loan, figured why not since my income has gone up significantly, and my credit has improved since opening the account. Let me lay out the numbers:

Current loan: ~7k left, 22 months, 26.99 interest, 408 payment

New offers; 2 include paying off another line of credit (credit card, ~104 min, ~3900 balance, 23.99 interest) in addition to the current loan:

Strictly refinance for the amount owed: 24 mo, 16.49 interest, 368 payment

personalfinance,Bathroom remodel or paying down debt?,"Hello all,

I think this is a bit more complex then it seems.

I bought a fixer-upper 1 year ago. I have done a lot of work to it myself and with the help of my handyman. We have lived in our current area for 9 years and are getting a bit tired of living rurally and would like to move to a more populated area and would like to sell our home in 1 year. With the sale and current appraisal And market we stand to make +30k(it is valued 60k over what we bought it now so I subtracted all the real estate fees and cost of a new bathroom). The issue is the bathroom has not been redone and needs to be. Although renos bathrooms actually don’t add that much value to a home this bathroom is not functional so will put off buyers. The shower is under the slope of the roof which means only someone 5’5 and under can shower. The cost estimates have come back at 7k-10k. 

The area we plan on moving is cheaper so our cost of living will be substantially less when we do move and the home we will be buying will be 2/3 of the cost of our current home is making our mortgage payment much cheaper. We would receive the same salaries because we work remotely. 

We currently have a personal loan thats 7k  with a 5% interest rate. If we instead took the money we could pay that and get rid of it but it would delay the timeline of moving by probably a 1-2 years so instead of moving in a year moving in 2-3 years to save up more money for bathroom reno.",finance
personalfinance,401k loan as downpayment to build a house,"Wife wants to build for our next house. Don't have a lot liquid for a downpayment.Have about $90k-$100k in equity in our current house.

Looked into using a bridge loan to bridge my current equity in this house as the downpayment for a construction loan. Couldn't qualify because the current mortgage, the bridge loan, and the full cost of the construction loan would all have to be under a DTI of like 43% or something (it comes out to like mid 50s). A builder just suggested this: take out a 401k loan to put 20% down to pay them to build it, then sell my house when the house is done being built, then pay back the 401k loan right away as a lump sum, and move in.(And then get a mortgage after the place is built?) Downsides I see are (1) not locking into my interest rate until the house is done next year, and not knowing *exactly* what the monthly payments would be until after the house is built and I'm already 20% in. (2) Losing my job in the year it takes to build would totally fuck this whole situation. What else am I missing? This sounds like a complete scam but I can't put my finger on it.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to spend 50k,"Hey guys! Long time listener first time caller...
 We recently sold our house and ended up with 50k after everything. Also when I resign from my job i will be paid out 25-30k.
 We are moving to another state and plan to buy some property and I will be building our home ( leaning towards shipping container over barn conversion... but that conversation is for a separate post). 
 Originally, the plan was to take a loan out for property and use the cash to build our home. Then with remaining funds, hopefully be able to pay off most of loan. Leaving us mortgage free.  My wife brought up the option of using the cash to pay off her $58k student loan which we have been struggling to put a dent in. Then we would be taking a mortgage to build the house. 
   Our current situation:
Credit score 735
 -Income 130k-140k but must take into consideration that I will be making much less initially when we move 
-wife student loan 58k with ranging interest rates between 2-6% ( we’ve looked into consolidating and refinancing but the rates really weren’t that great)
- my student loan 12k
-credit card debt ~2,500
- auto loans  25k

*note*
I have looked into mortgages and shipping container houses and I shouldn’t have a problem since we are building a foundation and securing the containers. I still think I would want to secure all the money to build  before I pay off the student loans with the cash.

Personally I feel like I should use the money to build the house and then begin dumping our “mortgage money” into the student loan. My wife feels differently and she is typically more savvy with finances... so I will humbly and openly listen to your suggestions",finance
personalfinance,Timing of Loans/Refinance &amp; Effect on Credit Score,"We have a few financial items we'd like to take care of, and I'm hoping for some crowd-sourced feedback on the best timing to complete each step.

1) We'd like to refinance our current mortgage. We are 6 years into a 30 yr loan with a (relatively) high interest rate. 5.125%. With interest rates at historically low levels, we'd like to refinance into a 20 year loan. Because our current interest rate is high, relative to current rates, we could chop 4 years off our loan payout period (20 + 6 = 26) and keep our payment about the same. We've even considered getting a 15 yr loan to lock in a VERY low rate, but part of me would prefer the lower payment of a 20 yr loan, as opposed to a 15 yr loan, and we could always make extra payments as our budget allows. The only thing keeping us from doing this right now is that our mortgage was part of a 1st time home buyers program in Pennsylvania that comes with a Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC). The MCC gives us a $2000 credit on our taxes every year that we live here as our primary residence. So any mortgage refinance wouldn't be until we had a good sense that we would be moving in the near future. (See below)

2) We'd like to refinance my wife's student loans. She's fortunate to have gotten a decent-paying job in her field of study, straight out of grad school. She did have $47k in US Dept. of Education loans when re-payment began in late 2013. All at a bargain 6.8% interest rate. :vomit: Thanks to some aggressive payments over the past year, and this current zero-interest period (COVID), that balance is down to \~$30k. But again, with interest rates where they are, it makes a lot of sense to look into refinance options. For obvious reasons, any refinance would wait until AFTER the zero-interest period ends. Refinanced loan would likely be a 5 yr loan, with a payment around $575/month.

3) We'd like to buy a new house. This is the big one, and the item that I'm worried will be most affected by the timing of the other 2. We're looking at homes around $300k, and we'll be putting 5-10% down. We should have what we need saved in Spring/Summer of 2021. Our current house is very rent-able, and our financial situation will likely allow us to keep the current house when we move. Potential rent is only $100-200 more than mortgage payment, so it's a huge money maker. But the house is 25

My rough idea of timing to get this done: Just after New year's, we'll refinance the student loan &amp; the mortgage on the current house. My main concerns revolve on how those loans could affect our potential new home purchase later in 2021.

We could also wait until AFTER the new home purchase before we refinance the current mortgage, but would that work better or worse? And would the extremely low interest rates last another full year?

Are there programs anywhere that will allow a borrower to do both a refinance and a new mortgage as part of a single transaction after significant underwriting?

(For reference, we both have excellent credit scores &gt;780. Both employed. Combined income is around $125k. Zero revolving debt. Both cars paid off.)

Any feedback much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Best type of mortgage,"I don't live in the US and my country has different types of mortgages that differ from each other.  Little information needed: my country's currency is X and we have another currency unit Y that changes every day with inflation and is measured in amount of X. My country's yearly inflation is between 2.5% to 3% (last three years were 3%, 2.57% and 2.27%).    


The difference in credits can be narrowed down to two choices:  


1.- Currency. I can choose to ask my loan in X or in Y. If with X, the interest rate is higher and I pay the same amount of X each month. If I ask in Y the interest rate is lower and I pay the same amount of Y each month, which translates to different amounts of X each month (barely any variation month to month though, but over the years it adds up). A few select banks offer loans in X, majority of loans are in Y. Also, salaries do not change with inflation each year, if you don't get a raise or promotion your salary stays the same.  


2.- Interest rate. I can have fixed or variable interest rate. In the variable interest rate it can be revised twice or once a year and it can go up or down based on the economy. Interest rates for the variable one are lower (right now around half)  than the fixed one because the risk is higher. I could also do mixed: fixed for the first 5 years and then variable.  


I am unsure of how those two choices can be mixed because there is not much information online about it, but I know they exist like that because I have seen examples of it.   


The one that is most popular is fixed interest in Y. I am assuming the fixed interest rate would be the better choice? But unsure if asking the loan in X or Y is better. On average based on what I have seen from all banks, interest rates for fixed in Y are between 3.2% to 4.0%.  


Giving an example of one specific bank with the most information online about its rates. Fixed in Y, interest can vary from 2,02% to 4,75%. Fixed in X, interest can vary 8,60% to 9,10%. The other banks dont have that information readily online and dont want to start talking to banks until I have things a little more figured out.  


What combination do you think is the most convenient and why? Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Cashing out retirement to pay debt? Advice appreciated (long),"I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible. I’m looking for some insight and constructive criticism with regards to my current financial holdings and my goals/plan for future financial success.

I’m 33 years old and I am in the USA.

**Financial Goals:**

1.	Pay off all credit card debt by December 2020.

2.	Pay off remaining debt (student loans/car) in 3.5 years

3.	Take advantage of tax advantaged retirement accounts while paying down debt (?)

**Career:**
I graduated 4 yrs ago and I work in Healthcare (direct patient care). First job out of school I was offered a position with a non-profit hospital making $29/hour (~60k). Annual raises brought me up to $34/hour (~70k) after 4 years at this hospital. PTO/benefits sucked, but the job offered a 403B retirement account and it was a qualifying employer for PSLF. My initial plan was to work for this hospital for 10 yrs for the loan forgiveness, despite knowing that my pay was garbage. I made the appropriate moves to work towards PSLF, but by the time I left this hospital I had only made 32/120 payments to count towards PSLF. Might as well note that I also worked a 2nd job between 2017-2019 which brought in an extra ~10-14k/year. Taxes in 2018 indicated I had made ~81k gross that year between the two jobs. All extra cash went towards debt payments, but paying debt down was slow going.

When the pandemic came into play, I left my job at the non-profit hospital, and moved to a new state taking a contract, for-profit clinical job paying $47/hr (~97k). I’ve been at this new job since May and I’ve been consistently working between 105-117 hours each pay period. Last paycheck my gross pay was ~5,800.00. After taxes (~$1200.79) and health benefit deductions (~$1,000.00- which includes $700 per paycheck contributions towards my new HSA account) I net ~3,640.00

Theoretically, if I continue to work this many hours I could hypothetically gross $139k in a year, netting ~87k. So far, I haven’t had any issues getting extra hours/overtime. Of course, that could change. I should note that I love my job and so far haven’t minded working all of this overtime.

**Debt:** Yes, mistakes were made with taking out student loans. I can’t go back in time to change it, so now I’m just focused on moving forward and paying it off.

**Total debt:** $177k 

* Credit Card Debt:  $~8k

* Student Loan Debt: $~155k

* Auto Loan: ~14k

**Assets:**

(1)	Roth IRA: 8.7k (I’ve only contributed 1,300 to my IRA in 2020. I stopped contributing to this account completely in order to focus on paying off debt). I have sell orders on SAVE &amp; WTI asap.

* FDEWX (70%)

* Individual ETF/Stock Holdings (30%): VTI, VXUS, VPU, ARKK, CIBR, SAVE, and WTI 

(2) 403B Account: 31k

* VTRLX (100%)

(2)	HSA Account: $1405.02

Just enrolled in HSA account this June. Currently putting $700/month towards HSA to max out for this year (2020). Once Jan 2021 rolls around I’ll continue to max out the account, which will reduce my per paycheck cost to about $270/paycheck. That’ll give me an extra ~$430/paycheck to put towards debt. I can invest my HSA account above 1k. 100% is in VTWAX.


Each paycheck, out of my ~3,600.00 I throw 1.5-2k at debt- specifically focusing on credit card debt at this time (2 credit cards left to pay off) taking an avalanche approach focusing on highest interest rate debt first. 

I’m a minimalist. I live in an apartment with my dog and cat. The only furniture I own is a couch, a couple of chairs, and a dining table. I sleep on the floor. Beds/bed frames are so god damn expensive. I don’t have expensive habits except for a gym membership (already paid $500 in advance for a year membership), which helps keep me sane. I do splurge on coffee 5x/week- also keeps me sane. For fun/hobbies I bike, read, swim/go tubing at the river and go hiking with doggo- all free!!

**Basic Budget:** $3,200/month

    * Rent: $1600/month

    * Utilities/Internet: ~$350/month

    * Groceries: $500/month

    * Transportation: $200/month

This leaves me with ~550.00 left over each month. This is typically eaten up by unexpected expenses (i.e., car repairs as of late).

So, here are my questions:

1.	How am I doing financially? Be brutally honest with me. Yeah, I know I have negative net worth so that sucks. I really spend a significant amount of time reading up on investing and paying off debt though (Huge thank you to this subreddit!!!). This is something I obsess about daily and it wears me down, man. I like to think that what I am doing now (i.e., being frugal, workaholic, and trying to pay down debt while still contributing to retirement accounts) is a good plan, but I literally don’t know ANY people in real life who make as much as me… while also having as much debt as me.

2.	In the past, I’ve toyed with the idea of cashing out all my retirement accounts to pay off debt. I honestly hate this idea, because I like the fact that I am able to take advantage of a 403B, Roth IRA (backdoor roth btw), and a HSA account. These types of accounts are valuable, so it doesn’t seem logical to me to ditch them. I could very well be wrong. I work in healthcare, not finance so wtf do I know? Lol


Share your thoughts, all. Roast me for all you’re worth. Sure, I’m a fuck-up, but maybe I’m a fuck-up that can be saved. I dunno, I invested in WTI and SAVE, so clearly I have tendencies towards lunacy. 

Any and all advice is appreciated.

stocks,Why $RKT is a 10 bagger; my overly detailed DD,"**Here's why I think RKT (Rocket Mortgage) is going to become dominant in the mortgage industry, as well as potential risks and responses to those risks.** \*\*Please note: This is nearly all qualitative fundamentals. I don't spend much time on quantitative fundamentals for reasons I'd be happy to explain some other time. And it's sure as hell not technical analysis because....cmon. Also, I am focusing mainly on their Rocket Mortgage arm in this thesis. They have a few other branches (which will be important down the road), but right now mortgages are the main money maker/area to focus on.

**Strengths of their company**

1. Their incredible focus on UX and UI, and a great all around customer experience. There app has 4.9 stars on the appstore, which says 1, it's a good app, but 2, people usually use the app as a medium to rate the service they get from the company, so in essence, rocket mortgage has 4.9 star rating on their mortgage service. They listen to customers and integrate their feedback.
2. Their focus on tech/data. Rocket mortgage is the only player in this space that is focusing relentlessly on a digital first experience. 
3. The company is growing, which will only increase their economies of scale and allow them to get better rates as they grow.
4. The amount of data/data points they have on their customers is incredible. They are an order of magnitude ahead of competitors when it comes to data and analytics on their customers. They are essentially the Google of mortgages where data is concerned. 
5. They have a refinancing retention rate of 75%, compared to the industry average of 22%. Refinancing is a large chunk of their revenue and is a very important part of any mortgage companies business.
6. Their potential for scalability is massive. In the past 10 years, we've seen a huge boom in software stocks. The reason is that software is infinitably scalable. It costs nothing (or extremely close to nothing) to add another user for a piece of software. This means the margins on the product can be incredibly high. This is similar to how Rocket Mortgage is operating. Since much of their mortgage process is automated and online, it is much cheaper for them to add new customers than their competitors. 
7. People are treating them like a traditional mortgage company, when I think they are a fintech company. This may be the biggest area where I am wrong, but I don't think so. All the analyses I've seen on Seeking Alpha, etc, talk about them as a mortgage company. One bear case mentioned that their forward P/E is around 16, vs 8 or 9 for Citi or Wells Fargo, and they suggested that this was way too high (in case you're wondering their bear case was $20). However, I am thinking of them as a disruptive fintech (although certainly not as new as something like Square). If you look at it this way, and compare their forward P/E to Squares of 152, it looks like an incredible bargain. Now, I don't think their P/E should actually be anywhere near Squares, and they aren't a huge growth company like Square, but I think they are a lot more of a growth company than other people are realizing. 

**Positive shifts in the industry:**

1. I believe we're going to see what happened to banking in the past 5 years happen to mortgages in the next 5-10. (Everything is moving online, digital banking, fintech disruption, traditional banks losing to more innovative players, etc.)
2. Haven't really seen much fintech disruption in the mortgage space yet, this means Rocket Mortgage can have the first mover advantage. 
3. Difference between other fintechs and the mortgage industry is that in this industry there are much higher startup costs, and you really have to have a lot of experience to do well. Rocket mortgage has Plenty of experience, (started in 1985, so 35 years) but they still are the first to market with a digital only platform.   

   1. Other mortgage companies can imitate the online experience, but they're not going to be winners. 
   2. Think of your traditional banking app vs. new fintechs like Square or Cashapp. (Personally on the ""traditional"" side, I use U.S. Bank for banking and Charles Schwab for investing. Both of their apps/digital experiences are OK, but nowhere as good as other fintech apps I use like  Cashapp or Wealthfront.)
4. Everything is moving towards digital. The boomers are dying, or at the very least, not buying very many more homes. The majority of new mortgages are going to be coming from Millennials, and soon enough, Gen Z. (There is the possibility that these generations buy less homes, as we have already seen. This is discussed in the Risks section). Millennials and Gen Z already do everything else on their phone and most of them will likely be interested in getting a mortgage on their phone/computer too. 

**Risks/reasons it could go wrong:**

1. They are too dependent on the mortgage industry/housing market as a whole, as well as macro trends like interest rates. This is the biggest reason I'm not more bullish. The housing market is incredibly complex and hard to understand, much less predict. There is plenty of uncertainty right now surrounding COVID, government stimulus, and unemployment. The best response here is that over the long run the housing market is usually a good bet, as everyone knows they're not making more land and people usually still want to own a home, but there certainly is a fair deal of risk in this too.
2. This ties in to 1. above, but Millenials and Gen Z may not be as interested in buying homes as previous generations. I've seen stats saying 70% of Millenials still want to own homes, but it's hard to tell. My response here is that even if demand for houses falls a lot, I think Rocket Mortgage will still have a dominant enough competitive advantage that they will come out on top and the stock price will increase. For example, even if M and GZ demand for houses falls 20% compared to previous generations (which would be massive), my wager is that the majority of M and GZ who do get mortgages would go with Rocket, and their dominance will only increase in coming years as more things go digital.   

   1. This also ties in to the above and point 1, but as ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood says, ""Innovations thrives in a crisis"".
3. They get disrupted by a smaller fintech. I do think that we will see more fintech players in the mortgage space in the coming 5-7 years. However, as previously stated, I think the mortgage market is inherently harder to enter than something like peer to peer payments or online banking. Plus, they ARE ALREADY the disruptor in this space.
4. Price is overvalued because it's so new. This is another factor I'm somewhat worried about. I do very little quantitative analysis to determine fair market price. I usually just look at market history (not technical analysis because that's bullshit, but just general market price history). However, with so little data it is hard to tell what's a good price. That being said, when looking at All Time Highs and All Time Lows, it is more on the low side (currently at $23ish vs ATH of $35.) 

**Question Check:** (I have a system of generic questions to evaluate each stock I invest in against. These are based almost completely off the work and process of both Stanley Druckenmiller and Warren Buffet).

1. Is the world changing in a way that is advantageous to them?
   1. Yes, everything, especially finance, is going digital. Mortgages haven't really caught up, but I think they will.
2. Does it have an asymmetrical risk/reward ratio?
   1. Maybe not as much as I would like (although companies like that are nearly impossible to find these days), but still yes. Upside could be huge if they become the dominant market player and realize 2-3 years of near monopoly position before incumbents catch up. Downside is likely only limited to US housing market downturn, which could be bad, but still recoverable. 
3. Do you like the company and believe in the product?
   1. I like the company. I haven't used their product yet (too young for a house), but every single person I've seen on reddit who has used them liked them. And they have tons of great reviews in the appstore (for the process, not just the app)
4. Could you hold this stock forever?
   1. Maybe not forever, but at least 20-40 years. 
5. Is it a company that is currently doing well that could do even better?
   1. Yes, they have been doing well for the past many years, but have really taken off with the introduction of rocket mortgage and I think will continue to do even better due to that. 
6. Do you like and trust the management?
   1. This is one area I'm weak in. The only management I know of is the founder, but I like his drive a lot. In case you don't know, he founded the shoe resale startup StockX too.
7. Could this blow up and ruin me?/What are the odds it falls by a ton? (""Don't lose money""-Warren Buffet)
   1. Unlikely to completely blow up unless there is some huge unforeseen occurrence that no one predicted.
8. Would you buy the stock if it was 50% higher?
   1. Honestly, yes. 50% higher right now would mean 34.5, which is just about all time highs. I think we have a lot farther to go in the future. 

I'd love to hear any feedback, especially risks/weaknesses I missed. Let's discuss.

personalfinance,Saving for College - Custodial Account or 529 Plan,"Hey PF Team! My sister is in the great Silver State, Nevada USA (relevant for tax laws). Due to the recent death of our mother, my siblings and I are going to sell the house that is under her name. After the mortgage is paid off, each of us will have a small sum of money to ourselves. It's not much, but it's something. I have convinced one sister (haven't spoken to the other one yet) to give me a portion of the amount that she is due in order to open up an investment vehicle for her twins. Originally I was thinking of a custodial account but due to Trump's recent changes on custodial account taxes, or the Kiddie Tax (super f\*\*\*\*\*d btw, taxing kids instead of the rich), I'm not 100% that's the best option. 

Part of it comes in the income - \*and my first question\* - a separate 1040 needs to be filed it the income exceeds $1100 (2019). If money is continually invested into varying mutual funds and those funds are never sold, it it considered income? Nevada does not have an income tax either. So is the income generated in Nevada not taxed? Or is it taxed only at the federal lever under the trust and estate taxes (ridiculously high for a kid's account)? \*Next question is for taxes\* Assuming no future changes (20 years is a long time), once the account is in their name fully (UGMA/UTMA) and they decided to sell the funds, would it be considered capital gains on long term investments or would it still be considered  taxable under the trusts and estates taxes? P.S) don't worry about the 15,000 yearly limit. That will never be hit for my family. 

\*Next question\* Is a 529 Plan the right vehicle? Obviously no investment is guaranteed growth but I cannot find growth statistics on 529 Plans. Would the average growth exceed that of choosing mutual funds for passive investment? (I know this answer is variable because what mutual funds are chosen and their overall performance for the next 20 years plays a huge role). Is a 529 a better option with the recent Kiddie Tax changes? 

I plan to make small contributions each month towards these accounts. It is a small investment in the future for my nephews.

tl;dr I know my sister will not save for their college if left to her own devices. So I want to help set my nephews up for \*something\*. Even if they don't use it directly for college, it will be good to give them something to get them on their feet, whatever they decide to do.",finance
personalfinance,Some involved Refinance and Tenancy In Common questions,"Hi all,

I am a co-owner of a triplex in Northern California, and live in one of the 3 units of varying sizes. The other co-owners live in the other two units, with all of us in a Tenancy In Common arrangement (i.e. almost, but not quite like a condo). We are all on a single mortgage together. And yes, we're all aware of the risks that entails, but have done this successfully for 10+ years now.

This is what its looked like:

Unit 1: owned by u/writesgud

Unit 2: owned by ""Brad Pitt and Jennifer Anniston""

Unit 3: owned by ""Arnold Schwarzenegger""

However, Brad and Jennifer are splitting up, and want to put Unit 2 on the market and sell to New Owners and move out.

Further complicating things, Jennifer wants to use the proceeds from the sale of Unit 2 and buy Unit 3 from Arnold. Arnold is ok with this, and happy to sell his unit to Jennifer and move out.

Finally, to add one further wrinkle, I might be able to fully pay off my share of this collective mortgage before refinancing w/ new owners, but would have to significantly deplete my savings to do so.

So, the questions:

1. If the New Owners and Jennifer refinance without me because I will have fully paid off my share of the debt, what implications are there for me in terms of the lender and their relationship to my share of the house? If the New Owners are unable to pay their share of the mortgage, could the lender still come after my part of the triplex?
2. We are also aware of alternatives to a large, jumbo (it would be for $1M+) loan. We could pursue fractional TIC's, but my understanding is that they don't typically offer long-term fixed rates (i.e. they become adjustable after a number of years), and the interest rates are generally higher by 0.75-1.0% because it's harder for lenders to collect ownership in the case of a default among the owners (I don't know if I'm using the appropriate terms for this). Still, having fractional TIC's would allow us to split up the loan so each set of co-owners would be responsible or on the hook for a smaller share of the total mortgage, without being liable for anyone else's fractional TIC mortgage.
3. I suppose the general questions are: how would you weigh out the following options for me:

a) pay off my mortgage (I will still have 4 months worth of savings afterwards and currently have a steady job)

b) enter into a group loan with new owners with my remaining amount of debt (probably could pay off in about 7-10 years), or

c) enter into a fractional TIC loan with just my debt, which would convert into an adjustable loan after 7 years (so right around when I could fully pay the loan off, or have not much left)

Given all of these circumstances (and thank you for reading this far), what other considerations would you have in trying to decide between these 3 options?

personalfinance,"Does it ever make sense to finance a new car, rather than an old car?","Hey guys,

To clarify, by ""Old"" I meant ""Used"" 

I am looking at financing a vehicle soon. I currently drive a 1994 Ford Taurus that is quiet literally as old as I am with near-bald tires, warped rotors and as of recent it sounds like the front-right wheel bearing may be going out. At this point, the expenses I am looking at for repairs will add up to a car payment or two, and given the age of my vehicle, it's tough to say it will even continue to run much longer after the repairs.

I've been looking at cheaper new vehicles in the 15K-18K range. One of the main reasons I've been considering newer vehicles is that more and more is that I am seeing used vehicles that are 2-3 years old having very similar pricing to the new models on the same lot. For example; a pre-owned 2018 Toyota Corolla with 35K miles listed at $17,604 then a 2020 Toyota Corolla with 3 miles on it for $19,500 - or a 2018 Kia Soul for $15,990 with 32K miles on it's a brand new 2021 Kia Soul for $16,745.

My thinking and my logic in my head when I see this is that:

#1 - If I spend $1500-$2000 more on the newer vehicle, I'm getting a brand new car with practically no mileage vs a car with two years worth of mileage

#2 - I can probably get a lower interest rate than I would with the used vehicle.  

#3 - My new car will have a warranty, which means I won't have to worry about any major services or issues being on my dime for the first several years - at which point the car will be payed down a significant amount. 

In addition to the two points above, I am looking at lower priced vehicles, such as the 2020 Nissan Versa or Kicks, 2020 Rio or Elantra, 2020 Hyundai Venue, 2020 Ford Ecosport, 2020 Honda Fit, etc - so how much can and will they depreciate in value over the next several years considering? 

So I guess my question is - what am I missing or misunderstanding? It seems to me that the mantra has always been ""Never buy a new car"" but buying used in the 15K range doesn't really seem to make much sense to me.

She now has a $326 a month payment at 4.85%, her credit score is around 760 or so according to Credit Karma. 

Of course right after she gets her new car, we start seeing commercials left and right for no money down, 0% interest and all that. So she feels like she missed out and if she waited two more weeks she’d have a much better loan.

I told her I’d do some research (aka ask on here) to find out if she should go through with that. Last time she checked, it told her the loan balance was too high to allow her to accept or apply for it.

My middle credit score through Experian is 781.

Regarding the interest rates, I tired 3 other local banks and they offered me 2.5% to 2.75% interest to refinance but I found out I am ineligible due to the banks using Fannie Mae for refinancing since I have two separate buildings that are residences on one property. Wells Fargo does not have this problem since they do not care about that and originally sold the house.

stocks,"TWTR: Twitter and its ""free rider"" problem","TLDR: TWTR is a buy, they should tax the pr0n

I don't follow r/stocks daily, but I've noticed that TWTR is not a commonly discussed ticker and seems overlooked despite being a major social media platform with over 180 mDAU and over 300 million total users worldwide and a seemingly low stock valuation.

As a social media platform, Twitter is actually quite unique, as it has become essential to experts, reporters and ""influencers"" in media, entertainment (including adult entertainment), fashion, government, politics, journalism, sports and business. Twitter is *the* platform for ""serious"" content consumers who are interested in current events and unfiltered real-time news. This makes Twitter different from the rest (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snap, TikTok) and IMHO gives it a unique advantage just waiting to be properly monetized.

Some other items that make Twitter an interesting investment proposition:

- Recent events related to activist investors Elliott Management and Silver Lake getting involved with Twitter and taking a stab at fixing its ""CEO problem"" (no need to get into this here as everyone is probably familiar with Dorsey and his positives/negatives as well as his unique situation managing two companies) as well as taking a more prudent look at current generous stock compensation, excessive spending, etc.
- Twitter has essentially no debt and is sitting on $6-7B of cash and $2-3B of federal and state tax loss carryforwards
- Untapped revenue: apart from current ad revenue, Twitter currently has no paying subscribers aside from an insignificant amount of premium data licensing fees

Out of these, the last item is key to pushing the stock up to a higher valuation. I believe that Twitter could easily increase its revenue 50-100% by:

- Charging regular users (such as myself) a moderate subscription fee of e.g. $10 per month for ""Twitter premium"" or a similar product (even if just 10% of mDAU signed up and paid this, it would amount to an additional $1B of revenue); one interesting area to explore here would be some kind of a collaborative deal with traditional media (think WSJ, WaPo, NYT, etc.) where you pay for ""Twitter premium"" that then gets you access to the paid articles and content behind tweets from media organizations
- Charging a substantial fee for their coveted ""blue check mark"" status (currently in the ballpark of 500,000 users) that was tied to e.g. the number of followers on those accounts (say ranging from $30 to $200 per month depending on the the number of followers); this could be another additional $100-500MM of revenue
- Creating a ""tipping"" system built into the platform and charging a fee from each tip (""fans only"" accounts, but also for sponsoring all kinds of various content producers, thinkers/influencers, ""starving poets"" and the like)
- Charging adult content accounts additional (higher) fees: currently, the adult entertainment industry is a major free rider on Twitter which is the only major social media platform that allows adult content (and the technology exists to easily classify any account as such); the adult entertainment industry makes a ton of money selling their content by connecting with customers via Twitter
- Creating other revenue streams for paid features such as content creation tools (keep mobile Twitter free but charge for desktop tools with better analytics, additional features etc.), charge for ""first access"" (non-delayed access) to certain events / tweets, etc.

I am not keen on just charging people to be able to read Twitter (I would probably err on the side of keeping the basic Twitter use case completely free as it is today), but I am quite keen on the other ways; I think that the tipping model (which I believe Twitter is already looking into) could be an effective way to keep the platform otherwise like it is today, but to create a new, novel revenue stream with a seemingly high potential.

personalfinance,Why do so many people contribute to a Roth IRA?,"I understand about pre-tax and post tax contributions and tax free withdrawals and everything.

They're being taxed at 22-24% federal tax rate plus state and FICA and all that. I wouldn't guess that they expect to be withdrawing (and thus spending) over a million dollars a year in retirement (especially if they follow the 4% rule), so why do they contribute to a Roth IRA rather than a 401k?

2. The health crisis that triggered this recession has brought unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus that is likely to become structural in nature. 

3. Sentiment and positioning have remained skeptical considering the size and persistence of the rally.

Reasons to be Bearish

1. Breadth of the rally has deteriorated since June. That’s normal after the initial surge in new bull market, but also suggests correction more likely. 

2. School re-openings are being challenged by new COVID spikes on college campuses. 

3. Congressional gridlock on CARES 2 fiscal stimulus package creates doubt about whether this bill can get passed in a timely fashion.

investing,Anyone Else Skeptical About Inflation?,"Seeing a lot of fearful inflation posts lately. Am I the only one who thinks this doesn't make sense?

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20200831a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20200831a.htm)

The federal reserve has recently revised down the ""neutral real interest rate"" (r\*) from 4% to 2%.

This totally aligns with reality. We are seeing all G7 economies mature towards a 0-2% real GDP growth rate. It's just a lot harder to grow a $20T economy by 4% than a $1T economy, obviously.

Not only that, but technology is a hugely deflationary force as well. Think about how many products are now free apps on your phone (maps, white pages, encyclopedia, telecommunications, etc).

The fed is clear in saying that a 2% natural real rate with sub 2% inflation leaves them less room to work with during a crisis. They say inflation expectations are largely based on historical inflation, and we are not hitting 2% in part because we haven't hit 2% in a long time. So letting inflation run a bit hotter for some period could reset those expectations closer to 2% will give them policy room.

Inflating the debts is definitely a nice side effect and probably the ""unsaid part"". However, they have set a clear target still of 2% inflation and price stability \*over the long term\*.

The fears of hyperinflation seem pretty silly to me. We are living in a time of historically LOW inflation and deflationary technology pressures. If we hit 4-5% inflation on a given year, we aren't going to turn into Zimbabwe.

What scares me more is a taper tantrum like we saw in 2018. However, this time around, the fed will not be aiming for 4-5% anymore but closer to 2%. So it should be less aggressive there, but many assets are still vulnerable to multiple collapse as risk-free rates bounce back above their current level. I have no idea how to avoid this because risk-free rates affect multiples across bonds, real estate and equities.",finance

Husband and I have a home that was gifted to us, no mortgage payment. We've been working on paying off our student loans and credit card debt by ""snowball"" method. We started paying about a year ago and have paid down around $20k so far. Our remaining debt is about $40k in credit card debt (interest rates 25%) and another $35k in loans/student loans ( rates about 8- 7%).

We've been debating on rolling our debt into a home equity loan, my husband big issue with this is we are risking our home (which is completely valid argument). We have very stable jobs in the tech industry so COVID-19 hasn't affected us. He's okay with the idea of rolling our credit card debt as the interest rate is ridiculous and the numbers make sense, but I want to roll all our debt into a loan for one small payment which will make it easier to make additional payments to the principal.

Our goal is to have it paid off within 2 years. I don't see how this is feasible if we have an additional $800/month tied up to the loan payments alone. My thoughts are we roll everything into a home loan at a 2.99 interest rate. Whatever extra we have per month would go to the principal.

His thoughts are the numbers don't make sense. We'd be double risking our home for a $2k savings on those loans... I just think it'll be more effective to pay everything off..

personalfinance,Stuck with tremendous debt from a car (asking for a friend),"My friend bought a CPO 2018 Jeep Compass sport and had buyers remorse from it after 3 months and never made a payment on it due to the COVID deals where you have 90 days until your first payment and traded it in for a brand new 2020 Kia Forte LSX. Out the door price for the Jeep was about 20k and the dealership only offered about 13k trade in which he accepted. So he's in 7k in debt on top of about 20k out the door price for the Kia so 27k with a 6% interest rate for 75 month and his payments are currently $439 a month.

personalfinance,To refinance Mortgage or not?,"First time homeowner here. Apologies in advance I know this is probably asked a lot here. 

Have owned the house since July 2014. Interest rate is 4.375%. 135K loan, I owe 120K now. 

Was going to make a $7500 payment right now to put it down to 113K. 

Monthly payment is $1280 a month. The PMI is 70 a month.  I plan to make an additional payment of $1500 a month for the next 5 years and have it paid off by then. 
The additional payment every month would total 90K after 5 years and the monthly payments would take care of the rest (23K) to finish paying off the 113K. 

I checked better.com and the best rate I saw is 3.3% with my credit score in the low 700’s. 

Talked to a friend who is a loan officer and he said the fee to pay his company to refinance is $1600. Plus I would have to pay the property taxes for 14 months upfront which I could recoup he said. Then there’s closing costs which I’m not sure how much that would be. 

Is it worth the refinance if I can only get the interest rate down only 1% from 4.375% to 3.3%?
Is it possible to get that rate in the 2’s if a mortgage broker shops around for me? Or is that probably the best I can get by what better.com says?",finance

personalfinance,Credit age vs less open lines of credit,"Hey r/personalfinance,

Question: Should I cancel a paid off line of credit that is my oldest account but I have no intention of using anymore because of its 8.5% interest rate?

Context: I paid off the last of my private (through my credit union) education loan last week. I have one semester left in school but have enough money saved not to need the loan anymore. My worry is that the line of credit was opened pretty fresh out of high school and is my oldest account followed by 1 credit card I use for anything else and then I have the new line of credit that opens every semester from my FASFA loans which I will start paying off starting in January and should take about a year. Once I graduate in May I would like my credit score to be high enough that I'm not going to find too many issues getting a (fairly low value) mortgage within a year or two. Currently I don't keep any balances on my accounts and have enough of a savings for a minor emergency. 

Other than credit age is there anything else I could be doing to build strong credit any quicker?

personalfinance,Cash Back for Chase Ultimate Rewards Points Worth it?,"Hey r/personalfinance! I've been thinking through the best use for my Chase Ultimate Rewards Points and how to get the most value out of them. My wife and I are on the fence between the options below.

For the sake of discussion, let's say I have 100,000 points on my Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. Through the Chase Website, I can:

* Get $0.01/point cash back for the points applied to my statement. Based on the way my wife and I pay our credit cards (pay off balance at the end of the month), this essentially amounts to $0.01/point into our pocket.
* Get $0.0125/point if we book travel through their travel portal.

Obviously, the second option is the best at face value; however, there are several reasons that makes this choice less obvious to me.

1. Anecdotal experience from my wife and I suggest that we can book flights more cheaply on our own (through budget airlines) than we can using the Chase travel portal. If others of you have different experiences, I'd love to know. This means that the $0.0125/point for using the portal feels like it has less value, and with the pandemic, travel is less appealing at this time.
2. If I were to take the case back option at $0.01/point, I could put this money into a high-yield savings account (currently, 0.8% APY), use it to pay federal student loans (effectively 6.8% return over the life of the loan, once the forbearance is over), or invest it in the stock market (5-10% return, eventually). My wife and I would like to use this money for our eventual honeymoon, so that means paying student loans and investing are less of an option.
3. This is a minor point. The Points Guy values the Chase Ultimate Rewards Points at $0.02/point, but my experience doesn't show that. I also currently do not have any other travel cards that I can transfer the points to in order to get more value out of the points (and no travel at the time due to COVID).

So my question is this: Which method would you choose to get the most bang for your buck, leaving the points in place and using it for travel, or getting cashback and saving? I know the answer depends on time, so let's say 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years. Also, if I'm missing something, I'd love to know.

personalfinance,"Called Great Lakes to have my student loans redisclosed and was told they don’t do this, and never have. My cousin had hers redisclosed in January. Am I asking for the right thing?","Hi all,

First of all, this is not super pressing right now as my loan payments/interest accrual are current paused due to COVID forbearance. I just have some time off of work right now and had planned to figure this all out while I have the time. 

I have a loan account through Great Lakes which is comprised of 6 different loans of various interest rates (3% through 4%). It also had a 7th loan with a higher interest rate of 6.55%, that I paid off aggressively through extra payments (it originally accounted for about 60% of the total account balance). 

My payments did not go down after paying off the higher-interest loan (as is typical for Great Lakes loans combined in one account). If possible, I want to have the minimum payment lowered so that I can start diverting more money toward my other financial goals while continuing to pay a (lower) minimum payment on my lower-interest loans. I was considering refinancing but would rather not lose the federal protections (especially now). 

My cousin was in a similar position and had her Great Lakes loans “redisclosed” in January. She said they basically accounted for her paid-ahead status and lowered her monthly payment for her account accordingly. I called Great Lakes this morning to inquire and they told me they don’t do this and have never offered redisclosure, and weren’t sure what I was referring to with my cousin’s account. 

Did I ask for the right thing? Does anyone else have experience with having Great Lakes redisclose their loans? Is it perhaps more of a special request and I should just keep calling until I get a representative who is willing to help (I didn’t get this impression from my cousin but I’m not sure)?

Strategists led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas reiterated their 2020 target of 3,600 for the index, implying a 6% jump from current levels. The S&amp;P 500's earnings recovery is ""ahead of expectation"" because of policy support from the Federal Reserve, reopenings around the world, and long-term tech plays, the team wrote in a Friday note.

The latter is particularly important to the index's rebound. Though tech stocks are hot off a multiday decline, the companies are still showing relative insulation from the coronavirus pandemic's economic impact. Tech profits in the second quarter ""helped offset broader earnings weakness,"" the bank said, and that trend is likely to continue while other firms play catch-up.

""As for COVID-19 sensitive companies, 2Q likely marked the bottom with earnings to see a sustained recovery as the economy rebounds, and consumer and corporate behavior gradually normalize,"" the strategists wrote.

The recent pullback in stock prices is ""healthy"" and was mostly fueled by technicals including momentum gauges and systematic selling, the team added.

The recovery from second-quarter lockdowns is also driving a faster-than-usual rebound in various market indicators, according to the bank. JPMorgan's US Quant Macro Index — a composite of growth, sentiment, liquidity, and inflation gauges — is in the middle of a sharp V-shaped bounce. The US manufacturing industry, while ""not booming,"" has stabilized in a steady growth phase, JPMorgan said.

Leading indicators, including freight-car loadings and private-housing permits, continue to trend higher and hint at economic gains to come, the team added.

The strengthening gauges should give way to similarly robust profit growth. JPMorgan expects S&amp;P 500 firms' margins to recover from the pandemic's hit by the second half of 2021 as demand rebounds and interest costs fall. The team said the index's earnings per share would hit $136 by the end of the year and $170 in 2021, higher than the consensus estimates of $130.19 and $166.39.

The US presidential election presents the biggest risk to the firm's forecast; each administration would come with policy uncertainties that could drag on investor sentiments. The lack of another stimulus bill to bridge the coronavirus slump could also stifle a market rally, the strategists said.

The S&amp;P 500 sat at 3,393.92 as of 12:50 p.m. ET, up 5% year-to-date.

personalfinance,Withdrawing from a rollover IRA,"Due to a personal issue I have to withdraw a large amount from my rollover IRA.  From my knowledge, I can withdraw money without penalty (due to the CARES act? and confirmed by the company of my IRA) but must pay taxes on it.  I’m trying to figure out an estimate of how much taxes I will owe so I can set aside that amount to pay it when it’s time. The problem is I can’t figure out how to do it.  Can someone please give me a step by step process on how I can calculate this? I am based in NYC so I assume I have to calculate federal, state as well as city.  I am also married and we usually file married/joint.  Another issue is that my husband has recently been hired at a new job but does not officially start until 9/21.  He has been unemployed for the past 3 weeks.  Before that he worked as a consultant through an agency for his old company (he was a full time employee there since last year but left bc he did not want to relocate - but they rehired him temporarily as a consultant through an agency so he can help with work as they start the department relocation process.  I can provide any other information if it helps.  Would love any help on this as I would need to withdraw soon and I want to make sure I have enough to pay the taxes.  Thank you!!!",finance
personalfinance,Any guide out there on deciding to rent out home or not?,"My SO and I are debating some time in the next year or so if we want to buy another home. If we do buy my SO wants to rent out our existing home and I think would be a great idea, but I just want to know for sure if it will be worth it or not. Any guide on all aspects that need to be considered including a calculator of some sort to decide if we should have a rental home or not?

Here's some information:

\-Location: Northern California

\-Est Home Value: $600k (built in 2014)

\-Current Loan Amount: $365k (just started 30 year @ 2.5% from a refi)

\-Mortgage: $2120/month (PITI), $1450 (P+I), No HOA

\-Est Rent: $3000-3200/month

\-Liquid Saving (including emergency fund): $250k

According to friends that rent in the area, they pay for all utilities as a renter which appears to be the standard.

If we did buy a new home it would probably be about $650k give or take assuming no significant decrease in the real estate market. Also if mortgage rates did shoot up a lot by then it would definitely affect our decision.

If we did buy we would put down 20%, maybe even slightly more if it would be worth it not to get a jumbo loan. That means our liquid savings would take a big hit, but we would still have more then enough emergency funds.

In terms of retirement we both max out TSP, Roth IRA and also contribute about $5000/year in 529 plans. Stable federal/healthcare workers.

Some questions:

1. Will renting raise our MAGI significantly? How is this calculated. Just curious since if it did raise it high enough we would have to do backdoor Roth.
2. How is depreciation calculated?
3. Is rental insurance significantly more than homeowners insurance?
4. How do you decide if you should use a property manager? Do you know what most typically charge? We would buy in the area so it's not like we would be within 15 minutes away, however I'm sure it would be less stress to have someone else manage the home.
5. Is there a limit with writing off property tax of the rental home (due to the $10k limit on state/local/property tax deduction) or is this separate since it's a rental? 
6. Any good resources to help make this decision?

That's all I can think about at this time. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Liquidity now or cash bonus later? Student loan refi with a twist!,"Hey everyone, was hoping to get a bit of feedback on the below conundrum I'm experiencing:

My refinanced student loans offer a rebate of $3500 if I pay the 5 year loan off in 4 years. I had been paying enough per month to take advantage of that for the past two years, but am having some second thoughts. The additional payment above the minimum was about $700/month to hit that 4 year target. At this stage in the loan life, switching to just the minimum payment would only extend the term by 5 months (from 21 to 26 months).

The refi loan is at a ridiculous 1.95% rate, so without that bonus it would be a no-brainer. I'm wondering if I wouldn't be better served saving that $700/month for the next 21 months towards a down payment fund as opposed to chasing that $3500 rebate. When looking in a vacuum, however, it feels like I'm essentially taking out a $700/month loan for 21 months, with a balloon interest payment of $3500 at the end of the term, which equates to a pretty high interest rate if I'm not mistaken.

When I start thinking about buying a home, however, it further complicates things in my mind. If I want to buy in the next 12 months, and that extra cash saves me PMI, that could be a win. On the flip side, a lower loan balance at the time I initiate a mortgage could result in a lower interest rate.

Any thoughts or things I might be missing would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

EDIT: For anyone who may have been lurking and is interested, I decided to continue my early pay down path. The $700 per month, if invested over the next 24 months, would have to make a return of about 20% to beat the guaranteed $3500 coming at the end of the early repayment.",finance

personalfinance,How to calculate my actual tax rate?,"Hello friends!

I currently work at a position where i am an independent contractor. The freedom of not having a real boss is nice, but it’s a bit of a drive from home. I’ve recently been offered a position as a contract employee much closer to home but I am having trouble comparing the wages. I’ve heard people say on r/personalfinance that if you get fired/laid off, and they want to hire you back, ask for 2-3x your wages but I don’t understand that calculation. 

Most of my income is in the 32-35% tax bracket for federal. State is 3-5%. I pay SE taxes which I understand is 12.4% up to about 200k and an additional 2.9% medicare tax. Then there is an additional 0.9% medicare tax for my tax bracket. This adds up to about 48% federal and 3-5% state. 

This is where I an confused. As a W-2 worker, I would only pay half of the SE tax right? But right now, I understand that half of my SE tax is deductible. Last year, my effective tax rate was less than 20% (per turbotax). So I am just very wildly confused on how to calculate W2 pay vs 1099 pay. 

Maybe this is too much to hope for, but let’s try to simplify. If I currently am contracted at $100 per hour as a 1099, I would have to make X per hour as a W2 to be about even. Can you help me solve for X? Happy to provide more details if needed!

Also, an aside on benefits. I already have a W2 position that I an contracted for which includes 403(b) match (2%) and health insurance ($25/month) so long as I work 20 hours per month for them, so although this new position will offer health insurance, that’s not a factor. (Their insurance is more expensive and there is no 401(k) match.) Yes, i would likely drop below the $57k max allowed for my SEP if I take this job so something else to consider, but benefits are not the main consideration.

personalfinance,Complete Finance Newbie -- Personal Loan to Cover Mortgage Down Payment,"So, I'm looking to buy my first house. Unfortunately, I only have a couple of months to look into it and not a ton of time to save up. A friend recommended I take out a personal loan in order to:

1) finish paying off a credit card, mainly for lower interest rates

2) cover my down payment -- I'm in Arkansas, so $5k would get the job done for my price range

3) cover misc. expenses or anything that pops up during the process

&amp;#x200B;

So, basically my issue is that Google says "" Most of the time, you cannot use a personal loan for a down payment on a house. Conventional and FHA mortgages prohibit the use of personal loans as a source for down payments. Even if you can find a lender that will allow you to use a personal loan, it is unlikely to be your best option for a down payment."" 

Again, I'm a complete newbie here, so I'm googling anything I'm unsure about. Based on that Google result, though, I should stay away from using that personal loan for the down payment? If so, I'm not sure of any other way to reliably acquire the capital to afford a down payment. If asked how I acquired the cash for the down payment, do I just reply that it was given to me by my parents or something? My first instinct is ""lying when making a huge purchase like this *might* not be the right way to go about it"".

Anyway, I'm trying to keep this as concise as possible, but I'm pretty lost here -- it wasn't really in my plans to buy a house soon but now it's seeming like the best solution for me going forward and I'm completely lost  (as I'm sure is obvious at this point) when it comes to mortgages, down payments, and loans. 

If you need me to provide any additional info, I'd be happy to do so. Genuinely, any help at all here to steer me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.",finance
gaming,Among Us resored my faith in humanity.,"A lengthy but inspirational story on how a series of virtual and one very real act of murder restored my faith in humanities ability to come together despite our differences:

After playing a couple games of Among Us I come across another player who puts in the pregame lobby chat “Trump 2020” and we begin to air out our distaste for one another’s political opinions. This escalated to the point that both of our respective blood is boiling at one another as we have completely disregarded the objective of the game and our newfound focus is emotionally and virtually damaging one another’s wellbeing. The admin drops out and I (because of my moral and intellectual highground I suppose) have been gifted the power to kick this addle minded plebeian from participating in my now prestigious lobby. I consider banning him, but something stops me from eliminating his existence from my life and decide a mere kicking will do the trick in demonstrating his inferiority.

Because we are both equally stubborn in our opinionated ways he finds his way back into the lobby for the next game and we continue the shit show of toxicity that has disrupted our lobby for the past 20 minutes. This eventually culminates in all of the other players leaving at the end of the game and we are left by ourselves at the beginning of the next round. Two souls, intertwined in our hatred for one another, confined within a room of a spaceship drifting through the galaxy; like brothers being forced to resolve our beef by parents that are fed up with our bullshit. 

Looking for any possible olive branch to extend, I inquire if myself and this gentleman can come to the agreement that one Jeffery Edward Epstein did not in fact kill himself; the single political equalizer I believe we can all get behind. This gentleman agrees and we come to a mutual respect for our differences in opinion in all other matters. This proves an integral turning point, as others begin to join the lobby unaware of the rollercoaster of emotions that me and my new friend have ridden over the last couple games.

A new game starts and I am selected the imposter, along with another random player with whom I do not share a complex history of emotional vitriol. I start the game as I would any other and kill a random player in the medical bay within the first minute of gameplay. My new friend walks in moments later by himself as I stand atop my fresh kill, covered in blood, knife in hand. He reports the killing but claims to have not seen who commited the heinous act. We continue our game until only myself, my new best friend, and an innocent crewmember remain. I suggest that the innocent man is the culprit and my best friend, knowing full well of my murderous ways, agrees and we vote him off together. 

With the most meaningful win in my somewhat lengthy career as a gamer blessed upon me by my intergalactic brother, I am in awe of the power of video games to turn two seething members of polarized positions together in under the span of 40 minutes.

 Brown, if you’re out there and happen to read this, know that I consider you a true brother and that our experiences together have single handedly transformed my perspective in our ability as humans to come together to achieve greatness, despite everything that might seek to divide us. 

Much love,

For me, I am biased as hell in my favourite because new patch notes came out today-ish, but Arcsys (for dragon ball Fighterz) usually does a pretty good job in my opinion, especially with newest patch, as they buffed the lower tier characters very well, and while 2 notable exceptions were missed (Goku Black and Zamasu according to everyone), given their track record of listening to fans, I can see them being buffed pretty well next patch.


Worst is Ubisoft hands down (Rainbow 6). Everytime some reads the patch notes, I swear I can here clown music. There have been some good changes, Amaru being an example, but compare that to: Jäger s entire existence, Buck losing frags, that time they rebuffed Ying into godhood, arguably Mozzie losing super shorty but that debatable, Clash (just... clash), and nerfing Goyo.

I would love to pay this off and have the means to do so, however I am very nervous given the state of the world and employment uncertainty.

Currently I do have an emergency savings fund with enough for 6 months of living expenses. I also have a couple of other savings accounts with a combined savings less than 10K. I still have 2 other debts, one car loan and another student loan, all of these loans are at about the same interest rate of less than 5%.

personalfinance,Savings vs Debt during uncertain times,"I had about 20k in credit card debt. I was injured at work, was on worker’s compensation and disability for about 4 years. I had 4 surgeries during that time. I used credit to supplement my income during that time. I did get a settlement, 15% of which went to lawyers,  it wasn’t enough to clear that debt, and tied me over until I found employment again. Now, 3 years later, I have about 7k left to pay. I have been moving the debt to 0% intro credit cards. The issue I’m having is after the intro, the interest rate is 15-22%, I then transfer and don’t use the cards. 2 cards recently got closed due to no use, which lowers my available credit and Fico score. I don’t want to lose these cards, but I’m not paying those rates. I have started putting small monthly recurring charges (Netflix)on some, and putting them on auto pay. I got my first higher limit card 20k with 0% until 1/2021. All my debt is now on that card. My question is, how can I get another high limit card with 0% while still owing that 7k? In this current climate, I don’t feel totally secure at my job. I also live in California where the wildfires are all around, the last 3 years we have had to evacuate 2 times, and close our office for 3 weeks due to fire and or loss of power.

I’m worried if I take the savings and pay the debt, that the credit card company could lower my limit after it’s paid. Then I don’t have the available credit, or the savings to fall back on. I had a Wells Fargo card that lowered my limit as I paid the debt off. I have 14k saved, my current bring home pay is approximately 4K a month, and my monthly bills are about 2500. Any advice about what to do from here would be appreciated. My 20k limit card is U.S. bank (Rei) I have a personal loan for 15k, and a car loan for 14k.",finance
personalfinance,Auto loan refinance fees,"First time refinancing an auto loan. Is it normal to pay a refinance fee? I applied through lending tree and most of the companies contacting me want $399 to $1000 refinance fee. Seems a bit excessive.

Current loan is 18,600 @ 10.41% with 57 months remaining. Loan payment of $441/month and I’ve been paying $500/month with extra going to principal.

Best offer I got was 4.19% interest rate at 63 months with a $399 refinance fee. Payments would be around $356/month.


Figure even with the fee, I’d be ahead with the new loan. Would still pay $500/month to pay off early, first payment wouldn’t be due for 45 days which allows me to sneak in a $500 principal payment at the beginning.

Located in Illinois, credit score of 687. Am I missing anything here or should I jump on this deal even with the fee?",finance

personalfinance,My student loan is in forbearance until January. Should I take the money that would've gone to my loan and invest it?,"Hi all, 

Some background first:

I've had two loans, one private and one federal. Since the forbearance, I haven't been paying anything to the federal loan. Because of that, I've been able to use that money and put it towards my private loan (which had a higher interest rate anyway) and now it's fully paid off.   


The only loan I have left is the federal loan. It has a fixed interest of 4.125% but I don't have to start paying anything until January. So I'm thinking of taking the money I would normally put towards loans, and invest it. I'm leaning towards some kind of index fund or maybe a mutual fund, I'm not sure, though. I want to shy away from selecting individual stocks, but I'm also willing to go slightly riskier options; I'm pretty open.   


I have some questions:

* Is this a good plan? Should I invest it for three-ish months, or should I just hand on to it right now?
* What are some good short term investments?
* Without getting political, the US Election is definitely going to have an impact on the stock market, one way or another. Is there anything I should be aware of regarding that?",finance

personalfinance,"Garbage credit, question about being authorized user to boost score.","Long story short I was laid off and unemployed for almost 3 months in 2018. Most my credit cards were closed to max at the time. All went delinquent and into collections. I think I had 9 total account in collections at one point.

Now I am gainfully employed and payed of 6 of 9 accounts. 2 of the last 3 accounts only have a few more installments left and they will be paid off.

What I didn't count on was the fact that now my credit report only showed 1 active account, my car payment with a ridiculously high interest rate I want to re-finance.

Moved back in with parents and are paying them a substantial amount in rent each month, Mother made me an authorized user on one of her cards (have no intention of using, handed it right back to her after I activated it). Since this was an 8+ yr old account in good standing this boosted my score about 25-40 pts depending on which agency you ask.

My question is this, my Grandmother has made me a similar offer and I was thinking about asking my older sister to do the same. I have no intention of using these cards and I trust they will continue to be financially responsible as they have been their whole lives. Will this look shady? To have become and authorized user on 3 account within ~30 days? I got my car in Feb, seriously stupid high interest rate and I need to re-finance.

personalfinance,Pension Plan from Mother's Death,"My mother passed away about a month ago and I'm trying to get all of my father's financials together so that he'll be able to live out the rest of his life. My parents were not great with money and made mistakes, but it looks like it can all be paid off. I'm trying to figure out how to navigate this influx of cash and what my best options are. I've spoken with a financial planner and we are going to meet with them soon. 

Pension Plan

* Monthly payment until my father dies - $2,133.67
* Lump sum Payment - $286,409

Life Insurance Policies

* $21,000
* $5,000
* $20,000 - Splitting between my Sister &amp; I

Vacation &amp; Sick Leave

* $8,642.54

Savings Account

* $23,000

Social Security

* He qualifies for my Mother's social security at a reduced rate at 60. I have no clue what that number is yet. 
* At 62 he qualifies for $1,071 a month

There's about $22,000 worth of high-interest debt that we plan on paying off first. We live in Michigan, so the debt that was solely in my Mother's name does not have to be paid back, and I've already taken care of calling those companies. Currently, my sister and I live with my Dad in the house my parents were paying on and they owe $117,000 at 4% interest. My sister was planning on moving out next year and I have been looking for a house, so there's a question that can only be answered by him if he wants to move into a smaller place. It is a relatively big house (4 bedrooms, 2 baths, full basement) for 1 person to live in. My Dad currently only makes about $14,000 after taxes and cannot financially support himself living there. My sister &amp; I are willing to pay him rent, but since we want to move out it can't be a long term solution. He is 58 years old so he can't retire yet. He is relatively overweight and I do not know the current state of his health because he hasn't been to the doctor in awhile. In my opinion, he doesn't take care of himself. His parents are still alive in their 80s, but have taken much better care of themselves than he has. My mother handles all the financials and my Dad really has no clue what he's doing, so I'm dealing with it the best I can. The crystal ball question would be how long he is going to live. 

I'm leaning toward him taking the monthly payments because he would be set for life with the $2,133.67 payments. I also rationalized him taking the lump sum and splitting it into two portions. Rolling $250,000 over into an account that could make a minimum of 4% a year? Taking the rest, which is $36,409, and supplementing my mother's missing income until he turns 59 1/2. Then he is able to withdraw from the IRA or 401k without a 10% penalty. The $36,409 will be federally taxed at 20%, so about $29,000. The additional income wouldn't put him in a higher tax bracket for 2020. The house needs about $15,000 worth of repairs with the roof &amp; windows. I've been told it might be a good idea for him to refinance the house for 30 years &amp; get a lower payment. My only issue is that he can't maintain the house by himself now and I don't see him doing any better in 5 years.

I've had two opinions from my uncle and a close family friend, they both have differing opinions. I know this is a personal question and it really doesn't have an answer, but I'm just looking for advice at this point. Just trying to get all the info I can and make a rational decision. I would like my Dad to be happy in the last years of his life because he thought he would never retire.

personalfinance,"Sharing Loan Payments with My Dad. How to calculate Principal, Interest, etc.","Background: While I was still in school, my dad partially paid for my tuition by taking out additional money on a loan he already had because it was a good interest rate -- far better than any of my student loan options. The intention was that I would pay him for a portion of that loan's monthly payments. A few years have passed since then and I've been sending him money each month that he puts toward the loan payment.

My question is, how can we calculate who owes what? For the sake of simplicity, at the beginning of 2019, we decided that of the $32,000 principal balance, my portion was **$18,000** and his portion was **$14,000**. I've been reading about how to calculate loan interest and principal payments and came across this [guide](https://mozo.com.au/interest-rates/guides/calculate-interest-on-loan#:~:text=Divide%20your%20interest%20rate%20by,be%20your%20whole%20principal%20amount).

I am able to put away $900 a month, which is why I have been able to hoard up $15K in the bank. I work for a job that is 100% stable and unaffected by COVID-19. 

So, would it be best to just pay off the 2 credit cards ASAP and start building up another savings or would it be wiser to pay off the first credit card since it has its 0% interest rate expiring soon but keeping a few thousand $ in the bank in case of a medial emergency or something? I am tempted to pay off all the credit card debts because it would be nice to not have those anymore but I want some insight. I am probably going to leave the medical debt alone because insurance is still paying every month a little bit towards the braces for my teeth... Any insight is helpful.

The SPY was up 0.50%, the QQQ finished up 1.41%, and the DIA was even. In contrast to the unstoppable rally that the market has showcased in the last few months, we are now entering into consolidation territory.

In relation to another COVID-19 package, according to Yahoo, House Representative Nancy Pelosi has stated that the house will remain in session until lawmakers can deliver another round of relief. However, a report published today by Bloomberg that the FED’s main street lending program, which went live two months ago, and out of the $600B that was assigned, only $1.4 have been lent out under “onerous” terms.

Some highlights were that they unveiled new Ipads, a cheaper version of the Apple Watch, and announced a fitness service. TSLA Tesla Inc is set to have its Battery Day on September 22. In anticipation of the event Elon Musk has already tweeted that there will be many new and exciting things.

On another front, some wild news regarding EV company NKLA Nikola. There have been massive price swings, a deal announced with GM General Motors, then a report on NKLA fraud, a response from the CEO Trevor Milton, and now finally today a form-4 was published where Milton bought $1.3MM worth of shares.

business,Small Business Advice: Launching During the Pandemic,"Starting a small business at a time like this might not seem like such a good idea with so many others struggling to stay afloat. Overall, the U.S placed 4th among countries with small businesses that have been hit the hardest by COVID-19. Small enterprise financing, business environment, and workforce support are the areas most affected by the pandemic.

It’s clear that the ongoing health crisis has spurred a recession and put many plans on hold. Understandably, entrepreneurs are hesitant to launch their business given that the nation is officially in an economic downturn.

**Making Lemonade Out of Lemons**

However, there are a few cases in which starting a business during financially challenging times can become profitable. For example, dining in restaurants has sharply declined but food deliveries have dramatically increased. Landlords are struggling to fill offices and retail spaces, but sales of remote work technologies are skyrocketing. The point is that the pandemic has created new problems that require unique solutions. Businesses need to adapt to these changing times and fill these new consumer needs brought about by an unprecedented situation.

Furthermore, there are added advantages to starting a business during a downturn. Other than capitalizing on a new consumer need, you can also take advantage of the low prices of resources. There is less competition in the market for commercial space, equipment, even labor. Financial institutions might also be offering lower interest rates for business loans that can be used to officially launch and operate your business.

**A Guide to Starting a Small Business Today**

If you’re reading this, you probably already have a business idea in the works that was postponed by the pandemic, as well as the funding to support it. The next step you need to take is re-evaluate these aspects of business:

**• Location:** Before scouring the state for good locations, evaluate whether you need one at all. Does your team need an office or can you meet virtually? Also consider the different ways you can deliver your product or service and a clear example of this is restaurants with their dine-in and delivery options. Maybe you don’t need all that extra space right away if most of your business will be online. Conducting market surveys can also help you identify consumer preferences and adjust your business model to meet those needs.

**• Business Structure:** Small businesses are typically a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a limited liability company (LLC). The first structure is simply when a business is owned and run by an individual, while two or more people run a partnership. An LLC, on the other hand, is a hybrid structure wherein the business functions like a corporation. It provides small businesses with certain advantages, including legal protection and lower taxes. Forming an LLC only takes a few simple steps and a small filing fee. It is highly recommended for small business owners who want to protect their personal assets outside of the business.

**• Recruitment:** Many people are currently job hunting so it might not be that big of a challenge to look for qualified employees. That said, you need to consider how much manpower you need and how to properly compensate employees while the business is still taking off. Be flexible and consider remote workers if the nature of the business allows it. Flexible working arrangements can significantly cut down on costs and increase the productivity of your employees.

**• Advertising:** Lastly, have a plan for how you want to market the business. Social media is, for the most part, free and can be successful in establishing your brand if utilized properly. Instagram and Facebook aren’t just for churning out content consistently. You can also use these to reach out to the community and build a loyal customer base.",finance

I'm currently getting my masters and I'm working almost full time. I just got a bump yesterday so now I will make 3000 a month before tax, and I pay about 650 in rent plus car insurance, a car loan payment, utilities, transportation when I take the metro, etc. My loan payments come out to about 1500 a month between private and federal which is what I was making post tax before my bump.  Im in deferment but still not ideal.

I also have $5000 left on my car loan. I have done a crazy amount of budgeting and if I eat cheap with groceries and literally only spend money on bills and put the rest towards my car, I could pay it off in 7 months from now if I paid $600 a month. 

Aside from the debt, I know I should be investing in. 401k and all of that. My job doesn't offer that, just basics such as Healthcare and also tuition funding. 

My question is, what do I prioritize? If I pay off my car that's normally 160 a month that could then go towards student loans. Im assuming this is the route to go? But also I feel like I need to be saving and planning for the future with a 401k and all this stuff.

Now, both my husband and I have excellent credit and he is a veteran, I called USAA and they offered me a great interest rate for the 2015 truck I want. My question is why would the dealership insist that I only use their bank? Do they have legal right to make me use their bank? 5% vs 3.5$ is big savings over time!!! Any advice would be so helpful.",finance
personalfinance,Upside down on a car loan and car needs extensive repairs. Advice needed,"I currently own a 2014 Chevy Cruze with all the bells and whistles (back up cam, blind spot detectors, remote start, large touch screen display, etc) I bought this car right out of college with no money to my name. I did a 6 year loan with lower interest rate 3.49% (credit union and co signer) so my monthly payments are $200. I still owe $7000 on it after almost 3 years of payments. The car in theory is great, looks nice, drives well, good gas mileage BUT it has a million mechanical issues. It is literally the car from hell. Check engine light comes on every 3-4 months and I have already poured $3000+ in repairs into it. This time around, the lights came on and I dropped it off at the shop. It’s has a laundry list of issues that total $2500 dollars just to get the light off (catalytic converter, belts, cracked coolant tank, issues with exhaust, etc). Note: I live in an expensive city so it costs more here for everything. So I’m thinking I should just get rid of it at this point. Looking up reviews on this car, it seems like everyone else has the same issues. Always in the shop for a check engine light and always a new issue. it’s never ending. At this point it’s a money pit. It’s got 80,000 some miles (I don’t know the exact number) on it. I want to keep it just for the fact of not having to buy a new car but where do you draw the line on a garbage car? 

I’m a teacher and I don’t have quite enough cash to cover the loan. If I get a decent amount ($5000?) to sell it/trade I could probably come up with enough money to pay the rest off. But I’m thinking with all the issues I probably won’t get that much for it. KBB value doesn’t look promising. My question is do I pour the money I have into the repairs then try to trade/sell it for more? Repair and roll the dice on driving it? Or just get rid of the damn thing and scramble to pay off the loan and then scrape together enough money to put a down payment on something else? 

I just can’t afford a high interest rate that comes with rolling over a loan. Like I said, I’m a teacher so I don’t exactly have tons of money coming in each month. 

I just really need advice/insight from someone who knows more than I do when it comes to all this. Anything would be helpful.

EDIT: here’s the link to reviews saying the same thing I am about these issues with this car.

personalfinance,Non profit Debt Consolidation Company,"25, hit hard by Covid. I would love to know the best steps to consolidating my debt and who to go through that is non profit and will allow me to make one payment a month, help me build my credit in the process and do this the legal and most financially beneficial way (profitable agencies have told me to not make my payment for 4-6 months as they negotiate a lower rate with each lender. *HUGE RED FLAG*). I found that profitable consolidation agencies are a scam and will destroy my credit, not lower my payment and make me stop paying my lenders. That’s absurd. Who has gone through this? What do I do, who do I go through, what are the steps, what were your interest rates, monthly payment and outcome once you’ve completed or if in the middle of the program, how do you feel about your progress so far?",finance
personalfinance,Taking a home equity loan,"My wife and I are looking to refinance our home to lower our interest rate and take a few years off the loan. We currently have a 30-year fixed @ 4.125% which we are 5 years in to. We have roughly 25% equity into the house. 

Aside from the mortgage, we have three debts of roughly 10k apiece: two student loans (one with a 3.5% rate, 6% on the other) plus a car loan (2.7%) We pay roughly $200/month on each student loan and $400/month on the car. The car loan has 3 years left on it, the 3.5% student loan is scheduled to be paid off within the next 5 years and there is no scheduled end date on the 6% one. 

My bank has offered me a home equity loan in lieu of an actual refinance at a rate of 3.1% fixed for 15 years. They are giving me the option of taking the loan for more than what I currently owe in mortgage principal and it would be enough to pay off 2 of the 3 debts. So I could essentially roll all of our student debt into our new “mortgage” payment. In doing this, my actual housing payment would remain the same, but I would need to keep some extra money separate for insurance/taxes since my escrow account would no longer be required. 

I also received a bonus from my work that is enough to pay off one of the debts outright. I have this money set aside from our checking and savings accounts until I can decide what to ultimately do with it. (I also have reason to believe this may become a yearly occurrence long as things keep going well with our company). 

I know that I need to do something about that brutal 6% loan and I know that I am going to take the home equity loan. I’m just not sure if I should roll both, one, or neither of the student loans into it and then what to do with my capital. 

My basic options as I see them:
- take the max amount offered, rolling the student loans into the mortgage and use my existing capital to pay off the car 
- roll in both loans, keep the car payment going and invest the capital elsewhere
-roll in one student loan, and use the capital to pay off one of the other debts
- don’t roll in either student loan, use the capital to pay off the only the high interest loan and leave the other payments as is 

We aren’t struggling to make any of our payments, just looking to make the most financially pertinent move. Any insights are appreciated.",finance

investing,What do you all make of the mainstreaming of the market?,"There are so many new investors it’s almost staggering! I know this is known, but the scale of it finally caught up to me.

My 22 year old nephew is Forex trading, and he didn’t even finish high school. The SoFi sponsored Cowboys game ran an ad claiming to give away free stock if your team wins....like fucking pizza!! The fully mainstreamed free trades and fractional shares. What in the world is this shit? CashApp has investing. Everybody I know is talking about this thing...as if it’s a brand new toy they just discovered! It reminds me of all those companies trying to buy up our gold before the 08 crash. As if they’re trying to get all the cash before we go to a new and fully digital currency (like the corporate fascist shit that’s  been happening in India the past few years).

On a more pertinent note, how has this changed your outlook on trading, investing and price targets? I mean if we are all now playing to the least common denominator of the hyped up FOMO and short sighted illogic of the masses, doesn’t this substantially change the game?

And the ripple effects will be huge! For example: an already defunct, decontextualized, profit based media system will be pumping out market related garbage for clicks, and this could drastically increase prices (or at least volatility)...as if it already hasn’t.

Schwab has a new warning ⚠️ note posted to their site about volatility being the “new normal”. Sure it may just be the recession-like/Covid situation we’re in...OR this could really be the new normal when the markets are completely mainstream.

...and we haven’t even mentioned the Fed...and I’m not going to.

I really just feel like the game may be permanently changed. And if you pit Joe Blow against JP Morgan, that spells disaster for even more people.

investing,Market Sell-Off September?,"Hi there, I want to elaborate on several thoughts/ideas about the current market situation and share my analytical point of view in hope for contentual feedback.

**Decoupling the Market from Economic Reality - The Status Quo**

Let's keep this short but make it clear: most people (whether financial analyst or retail investor) agree that stock prices (especially those of big tech companies) are inflated and widely overpriced. The COVID-19 pandemic caused economic lockdowns in most countries of the world, which in turn decreased their GDP while boosting jobless numbers. Yet,  the stock market is at all time highs, with the NASDAQ-100 being around 20% above pre-COVID levels. In the past two weeks we observed a 10% correction that predominantly hit tech stocks.

Bulls justifying this market direction with stimulus/QE from the FED, as well as with a lack of different lucrative investment options apart from the stock market.

**The Plague of Retail Investors - Recent Changes in Market Participation**

The sharp decline in stock market prices back in march brought a lot of new people to the stock market. People that do not have financial backgrounds and do not apply fundamental analysis before deciding on whether, and if yes, which stock to buy. They rather follow the broader sentiment of other investors and trust in brand names they are aware of (independent of the stock price). In my opinion, this is exactly this phenomenon that allows stocks like APPL or TSLA to climb higher and higher, even though if analyzing their numbers, no events/developments in the next 10 years could justify the price people are willing to pay for these companies.

**An Objective Analysis - Technicals and Quantitative Indicators**

I'm a machine learning engineer working for an electricity provider in Germany. While my job is to forecast electricity prices and trade with energy in real-time settings, in my free-time I'm modeling the stock market using different approaches and algorithmic methods. While I'm not claiming to be able to reliably forecast stock movements (probably nobody can) all of my models (time-series model on the major indexes and several regression models build upon different feature sets such as market sentiment, quantitative metrics, as well as political and environmental news) agree on a vast selloff in september.  
Besides this personal analysis for which I cannot provide real proof, most of the common quantitative measures (GDP related ratios, P/E averages, ...) and rations point to a highly overvalued market that needs to be aligned with reality.

**A Subjective Analysis - Theoreticals and Logical Indicators**

Apart from quantitative indicators that clearly speak for a sharp market decline, from a logical/theoreitcal point of view, optimism - as the major driver of this market - has it's limits. As Benjamin Graham already said, the higher they go, the harder they fall. I mean, people pumping up stocks because of stock-split announcements and the anticipation that clueless retail investors will buy the stock even more because they think it is on discount after the split went through, is an indicator for itself, that this market cannot be sustainable and is driven by blind and unjustified optimism. People no more think and assess stocks in absolute but merely in relative numbers. If a stock has fallen 3% the only logical response is to buy the dip, which is a good concept per se, but it needs to be evaluated how large the dip needs to be to justify buying an asset.

Looking at the bigger picture, we also need to take into account that we are in the longest bull run in the history of the market. This means that big players are sitting on immense amounts of profits. Once  they realize/secure their gains (like they did back in march when uncertainty of COVID developments was very high), the market will tank, which in turn will panic aforementioned retail investors and in combination is going to create heavy selling pressure which will snowball itself into an unstoppable avalanche.

**The Political Uncertainty**

While I'm not a supporter of Trump at all, I think market-wise he is a blessing. With an increasing numbers of indicators pointing to an end of his regime, I think market makers and big players will anticipate exactly this, and are going to gradually moving out their money in the upcoming \~6 weeks, depending on the election forecasts - which will create further selling pressure and bearish sentiment among investors.

**TL;DR** 

I think this market is driven by anti-rational optimism that will come to an end really soon. A wise man once said: *The intelligent investor is a realist, that sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.* For me it was about time to sell to what are IMHO optimists - namely the people that are still buying/holding at these price levels.

stocks,Thesis on Lennar Corp (LEN),"### Business Overview

Lennar Corp is the largest homebuilder in the United States in terms of consolidated revenues and earnings, an originator of residential and commercial mortgage loans, a provider of title insurance and closing services, and a developer of multifamily rental properties. In addition, they are involved in ventures and have interests in companies, that are engaged in applying technology to improve the home building industry and real estate-related aspects of the financial services industry.

Their homebuilding operations are the most substantial part of our business, generating $20.8 billion in revenues, or approximately 93% of consolidated revenues, in fiscal 2019.

The company was founded in 1954, publicly traded since 1972.

### Financials Overview

Lennar Corp has shown consistent growth of revenue (**x5**) and income (**x3**) over the past 9 years. During this time, LEN has increased its assets from 10B to 30B, justifying consistent revenue growth and demonstrating management's ability to invest money profitably.

Lennar Corp is the largest homebuilder in the United States in terms of consolidated revenues and earnings, an originator of residential and commercial mortgage loans, a provider of title insurance and closing services, and a developer of multifamily rental properties. In addition, they are involved in ventures and have interests in companies, that are engaged in applying technology to improve the home building industry and real estate-related aspects of the financial services industry.

The company operates at a healthy Debt to Equity ratio (D/E) of **\~0.8**. The management emphasizes its priority on reducing debt over time and has shown tangible progress on this avenue historically.

The company does not pay significant dividends, which can be explained as the management focus on business growth reflected in significant growth in assets and revenue.

Revenue is not recognized in homes that are the subject of sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners.

### Risks

* Mortgage interest rates may not continue to be favorable. With mortgage interest rates being at their all-time low, homebuyers have been experiencing the most favorable economic conditions. Shall this change in the future, LEN's performance and its growth potential may start to deviate from its current streak.
* The business is highly dependent on the price of land, and the demand for it. Shareholders who purchased LEN in 2007 would've seen a break-even return as late as in 2015 following the real estate crisis of 2008.
* Lennar finances most of its expenses associated with homebuilding. Funds for such financing usually come from banks. This arrangement may significantly increase the cost of business shall the interest rates increase. Having just observed near-zero interest rates which will unlikely stay low forever, this presents a considerable threat for future growth. In the past decade, LEN has shown stable operation and consistent growth with the interest rates under 2.5%.

### Conclusion

At present time, there is hardly a strong motivation to purchase LEN as an undervalued security, despite its attractive value appeal. Its finances indicate strong business performance and management's orientation on shareholders' value. However, LEN has been priced at 10-15 PE during the past decade, which is where it currently resides. If the stock falls under $50 (compared to $73 at the time of this writing), this analysis would encourage a buy for LEN as a value pick.",finance

CryptoCurrency,The Tether Conspiracy,"I am going to write a long article/rant against the Tether conspiracy. The reason is not that I have any vested interested, it’s not that I like the guys and secrecy of their project and it’s not that I don’t like transparency in general. But as with all conspiracy theories they need some sense of logic and I am here to provide this without insider knowledge. Just rational thinking as an investor.

## What is Tether?

Tether is a \*centralized\* cryptocurrency run by the same people that run [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/), one of the first and biggest exchanges. It’s ticker is **USDT** and you can find it in almost every cryptocurrency exchange. It has a price tied on the US Dollar but that is precisely the issue of the conspiracy theories. They claim that Tether is not actually tied to the dollar and that it’s value is used to prop up the value of Bitcoin. I will break down both arguments rationally.

## Is it backed by USD?

First of all there is evidence form the [long trial of NY attorney](https://www.coindesk.com/nyag-bfx-letter-hearing) that is going on for ages. So let’s first understand something. Tether and Bitfinex is providing a worldwide service for cryptocurrency which is NOT legal tender in every country and has many rules and regulations. Therefore it’s totally unrealistic to think of it as a normal bank that needs to be super transparent to its shareholders. It provides a certain service to the cryptocurrency community that is supposed to not want to be traced. Now on the matter of if it is backed or not, this trial has revealed that *it was indeed backed* until a foreign government(s) froze part of their money supply in the order of 20% or so. After that they did a reverse ICO on Bitfinex and got the money supply they wanted. Now other reasons to debunk this theory if you are thinking straight:

1. It is absolutely impossible for all the cryptocurrency exchanges that deal with millions of volume to not know if something is wrong and expose themselves to systemic risk like that. It is like saying that JP Morgan doesn’t know if their Gold suppliers are scammers or not. Yes they do if they are the same suppliers for all the big banks. And in the end, if they are scammers, anyone reading this article is in no way to tell and now more about the truth.
2. Tether has had an audit (although not complete and controversial) that was done by a firm founded by US Federal Judges who would put their reputation in front if they were attesting to a scam. You can find the relevant article [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cryptocurrencies-tether/cryptocurrency-firm-tether-releases-law-firm-report-attesting-to-u-s-dollar-reserves-idUSKBN1JG1SB).
3. Tether has kept its price peg. That is extremely important because in the open market if I know that Tether is unbacked that means that I should short sell it because the price will drop. But the price hasn’t dropped. When FUD was abundant the Bitfinex guys were actually buying their reserves on discount! That is incredible because they made money on people speculating on their reserves that they knew (I suppose!) that were there.

## Market Manipulation

First of all I will start by saying that nobody knows when the Bitcoin market is going up, down or sideways. There are too many variables and unknowns even to the higher echelons of Bitcoin hodlers (see whales). As an example a Japanese liquidator was selling en masse Bitcoins in 2018 in the open market without anybody knowing it. Also, bubbles get created by pure **mania**. Nobody needed Tether to pump in 2017, you could go in taxis and the cab driver would tell you to buy altcoins! Nevertheless there are at least 2 opposing studies done by universities where one finds that it was indeed the culprit and the other one finds that price was irrelevant and no wrong doing. You can chose your medicine here. The fundamental fact that newbies scream about in the forums and it’s absolutely driving crazy is this:

Tether is **supposed** to “print” more when exchanges ask for liquidity because of increased deposits.

It is extremely tiring to read every day on reddit that “Tether prints another 4 million USD” kid of posts that assume that this is money that is non-existent. No, that’s not how it works. On the opposite side, Tether also [burns](https://www.coindesk.com/tether-just-burned-500-million-usdt-stablecoin-tokens) tokens, something that very few know, realize and understand. So the act of adding liquidity is obviously correlated to the price because liquidity increases when big market movements are coming. That doesn’t and can’t prove of manipulation. There was this famous [Bitfinexed](https://twitter.com/bitfinexed?lang=en) account on Twitter that went silent. A guy that was obsessed for years and years with Bitfinex.

## Conclusion

I am not saying that Bitfinex and Tether are legit. I am saying that as an investor I need to take a critical look at what’s going on and stop hearing cassandras. Yes maybe they are scammers and maybe they will default. If this happens it means that most or \*all\* of the cryptocurrency exchanges **knew** and nobody said a thing. That means that you know better than the NY attorney that confirmed they were in possession of at least 80% of their reserves and the other ones were confiscated. To make things simple, your local bank doesn’t have 80% reserves today if needed. I hope I am correct because Tether could take down the price of Bitcoin a lot if it fails but it won’t be a death blow for sure. The are other stablecoins that are gaining traction (see GUSD,USDC,DAI).

personalfinance,"Withdrew money from mutual fund, how badly did I mess up?","Hello PersnalFinance,

Apologies in advance about formatting, I'm on mobile.

TLDR at bottom.

I am in the process of opening a business with my fiance, and I had this mutual fund since I was a kid. We've taken money out of it over the years as needed for my college expenses and such (I graduated last year) and there was about 11k USD in there left. We've used our personal savings (not including the mutual fund money) to fund the new business and to put us in a good position when we open, hopefully within the next month or two.

To the heart of the question: I had planned on using the mutual fund money as a super last line emergency fund for the business while we build our savings back up. Most businesses fail within the first couple of years, so I didn't want the mutual fund money in the stock market subject to highs and lows since the time horizon for us needing it is so short. I withdrew some of the money around 10k or 3+ months of operating expenses. I should be able to afford the taxes on it without a problem.

It's a mutual fund though, so it's been making pretty good returns with low fees since it's inception in like 2003, like the annual average return is over 10%. 

Did I screw up by taking the money out? If I leave it out of the mutual fund for 3 years I feel like I'm missing out on like 3-4k of growth, but I'm also kinda terrified about what's going to happen this and next year between the pandemic and the election... 

My family is very supportive and has offered the use of their HELOC to loan us money at a small interest rate (4%) if needed. We've all sat down and have an agreement in place regarding this HELOC loan. This happened after I drew out the mutual fund money though.

Should I throw that mutual fund money back into the original mutual fund? Should I throw it in a different mutual fund? Should I hold out till the business turns a profit and then throw it back in? Is there a reason why we wouldn't throw the money back in immediately? I don't have a lot of experience here and you guys were super helpful with my last question regarding taxes, so I'm back.

I will be staying at my retail job separate from the business venture, making enough to support us for the first few years while we get off the ground, so it's not like we are *completely* at the whims of the market.

I'm risk tolerant enough to open a new retail business during a pandemic, but I'm risk adverse enough to panic about it even though I have almost every safety net available to me. 

TLDR: I took out money from a strongly performing mutual fund for emergency fund money for a new business, and then found out there's a good chance I won't actually need it as we have this new other line on emergency money that is cheaper to use. What should I do with the mutual fund money we already took out?",finance

My mother is freaking out a little bit about being on her own as my father took care of all of personal finance through my childhood and adulthood. My mother and father did a fantastic job in raising me, and I currently have a sizable savings and income at the age of 30.

My mother is currently worried about the amount of her personal savings and worried about my dad stashing and hiding money away and denying her anything to live off of for the next 20 years. My mom offered for no lawyers and a buy out of 1 million in assets and cash, but that was a hard no. My mom also offered to stay together, but legally separated, also a hard no.

Assets as of July 31st:

My mother:

268,000 Traditional IRA (52% stocks, 48% bonds)

&amp;#x200B;

My father:

1,465,000 Rollover IRA from pension and 401k (50.8% stock, 43.8% bonds, 5.4% cash)

&amp;#x200B;

Shared:

Checking - $26,000

House - $340,000 not paid off, \~140k to go, 3.5 interest rate

Condo - $320,000 paid off, \~550 a month in dues

3 cars - $35,000 all paid off

&amp;#x200B;

My mom currently works for fun at a winery and has about 13,000 a year in income. It makes things complicated because her medical insurance is about 985 a month. My dad has canceled all the credit cards as well.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of immediate moves to consider:

One of those shared assets is a Jaguar XJ-L worth around 9k. She wants to sell/trade it immediately to buy something better in snow, so we have been looking at AWD SUVs as a replacement. Currently she has no way to trade in the Jag or secure funding as the title is in both names. We want to pull some of then 268k to pay for the vehicle in cash. So we are working on that.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan of action:

\- open credit card(s) in her name

\- sell off 20k of traditional IRA to pay for car and lawyer

\- try to trade in Jag and buy a low mileage used SUV for 17k

&amp;#x200B;

What else does she do right now before going through a painful divorce? She has secured a lawyer and will proceed very soon, but I am torn on giving her any financial advice as my dad considers it a conspiracy against him. I just don't want my mom to go hungry (which I wont let happen obviously) or not have a place to stay just because my dad is not in the right state of mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.",finance

stocks,FDX was a solid gainer for the past 3 months,"This sub has a lot of people that track hot stocks that return big gains in weeks. But Fedex has been on an amazing positive march without any corrections since June 15.

In retrospect, UPS blew out their earnings numbers on July 30. Fedex was reporting earnings on September 15, 6 weeks out from the UPS reports. Since then, FDX has gained 50% as a stock in 6 weeks.

I went back and looked at Fedex posts in the past 3 months and there are almost none. Its funny how sometimes the unsexy stocks are the ones that have the best returns.

FDX 200c options for October 16 went from $1 to $50. There were a few people calling out FDX, but not the regular reminders of everything that are going super well with Fedex. This post really nailed it:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gw4hhb/i_need_insights_on_fedex_corporation_nyse_fdx/

* USPS top delivery contractor

* Ecommerce blowing up

* 2% dividend

* Entire delivery industry seeing a bump (ie. UPS)

* Trouble with USPS helps private delivery firms due to reliability and stability

* Aggressive hiring strategy to compensate for demand


Now the question is, can FDX continue the momentum given that they had an amazing blowout quarter. Its worth keeping an eye on this stock to see how it'll continue its amazing growth!

Something to consider is that FDX is 1/3 the mkt cap of UPS, so it has lots of room to grow.",finance
personalfinance,Worth paying of 401k loan early (or paying off a lower interest rate car loan)?,"I'm trying to do some financial planning. I took out a 401k loan earlier this year to help pay off some other debts and increase my credit score for a refinance.

I'm hoping to have all my revolving credit paid off by the end of the year, then I have to start making decisions about other debts. 

Is there any financial reason I'd want to pay of my 401k loan early (other than the potential that I might be missing out on any earned interest)?

If I had a car loan at 4% and my 401k loan at 5.5%, would I be better off paying down the car loan or the 401k loan? I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this since the 5.5% is going toward me. Since the money is coming back to me, it's effectively a 0% loan.

Seems like it really depends on the market. If the market does better than the APR of the car loan, then paying off the 401k loan makes more sense right?",finance

personalfinance,FHA Loan + down payment+ cost of monthly house payment?,"My partner and I are interested in eventually purchasing a home and I understand one of our options to be FHA loans. I read a bit online about them, but I’m still a little confused on how they work... 

in the case of this type of loan, how would a monthly payment look on a house that’s, for example, $250K? From my understanding, you can put a small down payment on a home and have a low interest rate on the loan. However, I’m confused about the down payment and monthly payment part. If we put down less than 5% of that $250K, then wouldn’t the monthly payment be really high? 

Aside from this, are there any restrictions on the type of homes you can get? I’ve only read single family homes are acceptable but what about something like a condo? What type of living accommodation is covered by an FHA loan? 

Thanks in advance for the help!",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Advice,"Hey guys, my wife and I are looking to purchase our first home and we need some advice on our purchase timeline. Initially, we were hoping to get pre-approved next month and purchase a home in the November-December timeframe. I might be overthinking, but I think our circumstances indicate we should wait another year. Here is the pertinent info:

Gross Monthly Income—$6250 (me, with $400/m raise coming in April), $1400 (wife).

Monthly Debts—$265 (Car #1), $436 (Car #2), $392 (Student loans-IBR forgiven after 20 years of payments).

Outstanding Loan Balances—$10,000 (Car #1), $22,500 (Car #2), and $140,000 (total student loan balance).

FICO 2 Scores—752 (me), 644 (wife).

Savings—$9,500.

Current Rent—$1160

We live in an expensive, high growth area. It’s currently a seller’s market. We are interested in homes in the 215,000-280,000 range. We qualify for a nice DPA program to cover 3-5% down payment, so we will need to cover closings. Both of our jobs are very steady.

I am considering trading in my $10,000 vehicle (valued at $12,000), buying a junker, and paying off the wife’s vehicle by March of next year. This would eliminate all debt other than student loans, which would allow us to qualify solely on my own income and thus obtain a far better interest rate and PMI since my credit score is a 752. We could have more than enough saved for closing costs by next August. In order to stay under a .43 back end DTI, we could then afford up to a $300,000 home (factoring in $140 PMI, 2.7% interest rate, and $6000 annual property taxes). We would likely stay in the 270K-280K range anyway.

I’ve been crunching the numbers and this seems like a sound plan, but I’ve never done this before and want to make sure I’m not missing anything major before we go down this path. Only real downside of waiting is that we have to stay in an apartment for longer and home values will continue to rise, interest rates might increase again. Am I just being paranoid and we can actually afford a home now? Any and all advice is much appreciated!

TLDR—should we pay off car loans before buying a house?",finance

Projections from individual members  also indicated that rates could stay anchored near zero through 2023. All but four members indicated they see zero rates through then. This was the first time the committee forecast its outlook for 2023.

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance - am i getting ripped off?,"I don’t really have anyone in my life with any experience to ask here, so I’m going straight to the source for some ... am i getting ripped off... type of advice.

I have been paying on my home for about 6 years. I had a fha 203k loan originally for 180,000. I currently amount to pay off is 168,000. X private lending company sent me an advert in the mail, since i’ve paid so much, i can drop PMI is i refinance. i also have 44,000 in federal student loans (@6.5%) , company x is offering to roll in.

Total loan amount 225,000. interest rate 3.25%. closing costs $13,840. 

My main question is around the closing costs. they have ~7,000 in origination, services, appraisal, title co fees, lender’s title insurance, etc. additionally, they are also putting my entire years (2020) property taxes and annual insurance premium into the loan to cover the escrow. this totals around 7,000. i’ve been paying into my current escrow each month and i pay my insurance separately from all of this, so why are they including this in the loan? this seams like an unnecessary way to increase my total loan amount so the lending company can collect more ? should i get a check back from my original lending company for the amount currently in escrow? 

They are also trying to put cash in at closing for services i paid for (like appraisal). this is less than 1000, but it seems like they are trying to make me loan me some money for something i paid for while they collect interest?? 

Second, giving the US federal student loan is government owned, is it a good idea to have the new lending co buy this out on my behalf? or should i keep those separate even though they are a higher interest rate in the potential event of student loan forgiveness or anything like that?",finance
personalfinance,Tax Implications of 15yr vs 30yr Mortgage,"Due to the very low interest rates available right now, I am starting the process of refinancing my 30 year mortgage (which currently has 27 years remaining). I am debating about whether to switch to a 15 year loan instead since I am able to get an interest rate of 2.25% for a 15yr vs 2.625% for a 30yr. From similar posts asking about 15yr vs 30yr the common pros/cons of the 30yr to be:

**30yr Pros**

* Lower monthly obligation in the event that I hit financial hardship (i.e. lose my job).
* I can invest the difference in monthly payments and likely get a better return than 2.807% (APR of the 30yr rate).

**30yr Cons**

* Principally (pun intended) I would be indebted to the lender longer. In other words, I don't get the satisfaction of owning the home free and clear, nearly as quickly.
* It requires discipline on my part to actually invest the difference in payment instead of just spending it.

But isn't there also a significant tax implication? Since I make a tax deduction on the interest of my mortgage, wouldn't I also be able to make a larger net deduction over the course of 30yrs with a 30yr vs a 15yr (since I pay more in interest with a 30yr over the life of the loan)? I haven't seen this come up in my research, so looking for more input.

Any other pros/cons? Anything related to having more equity in your house sooner?

Edit: I currently do an itemized deduction, and expect to continue to do so. I recognize that the most people use the standard deduction, in which case the tax benefit is not applicable.",finance

stocks,Psycho Market Recap - Wed Sept 16 2020,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, Sept 16, 2020**

Stocks opened high but erased their gains and turned mixed as investors digested the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) September monetary policy statements and remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed signaled that interest rates would remain at near-zero through 2023 in an attempt to buoy the virus-stricken economy.

In their report, the FOMC once again reiterated that ‘the path of economic recovery will depend significantly on the course of the virus \[coronavirus\]”. They said, “The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term”.

On a positive note, the Fed’s outlook for economic contraction was less dire compared to previous months, suggesting a rising level of optimism in the Fed’s projections. The Fed forecast a 3.7% contraction in real GDP and an unemployment rate of 7.6% by the end of the year, versus its June outlook for a 6.5% GDP contraction and jobless rate of 9.3%. The Fed also added that it would continue its current Treasury and mortgage-backed securities purchases “at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions.”

Once again, in his statements Powell urged lawmakers to pass more fiscal stimulus to provide direct support to small businesses and households, stating that the initial faster-than-expected economic recovery could be threatened with the enhanced unemployment numbers as direct support measures expire. Both Powell and other FOMC members have repeatedly underscored the importance of both robust monetary and fiscal policy to economic recovery. Powell said” “The people who worked in those service jobs, particularly the entry-level, lower-paid workers, they're the ones who are most vulnerable. And those are the ones who we really need to look out for both through Fed policy, which will be there to support the economy — but also through fiscal policy \[provided by congressional lawmakers\]”.

**Highlights**

* Facebook (FB) finished the day 3.24% down after it was announced that Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will file an antitrust lawsuit against the company and that Kim Kardashian will boycott FB and IG as a protest to their mishandling of info.
* General Electric (GE) stock spiked 11% after it was announced the company would have positive free cash flow by end of 2020.
* Snowflake (SNOW) went public today in style, with the stock price more than tripling compared to $120 pricing the stock was listed at, becoming one of the most expensive stocks in the market. For context, the stock is valued at about a third of the market cap of Oracle (ORCL), which this year should have about 70 times as much revenue as Snowflake. Microsoft (MSFT) right now has a market cap of $1.6 trillion, about 10 times current year estimated revenues. Were it valued like Snowflake, it would be worth $17 trillion,
* Shares of Spotify (SPOT) fell as much as 7% after Apple (AAPL) announced a bundled plan for all its services that lowered the cost of Apple Music subscriptions.
* Inovio (INO) has been on an absolute tear recently, with the stock price up 35% today (77% up in the week).
* Pacific Ethanol (PEIX): HC Wainwright lifted the price target from $3 to $16 that’s over 400%!
* NXP Semiconductors (NXPI): Needham lifted price target from $140 to $150. stock is currently at $130
* Paycom (PAYC): initiated by Cowen at $325 OUTPERFORM. The stock is currently $280, so very bullish.
* Overstock (OSTK): Credit Suisse Group initiated coverage at $91 price target and OUTPERFORM. Stock is currently at $73, so very bullish.
* Gamestop (GME) had nice run up 22% for the day
* Digital Turbine (APPS) has been on a tear up 12% and over 200% in last 3 months.
* Oracle's (ORCL) TikTok bid apparently leaves US security concerns unaddressed.",finance

personalfinance,When to dispute a negative mark on my credit report,"I'm preparing to purchase my first home and I'm reviewing my credit score to ensure that I can get the best interest rates available to me. I'm currently at a 720 but I'd like to get it higher. Looking at my credit reports, I can see I have a few negative/delinquent marks on my report that I think are bringing me down. These were against loans I took out for school many years ago. There was a period of time that I was delinquent on making payments which I'm sure is what I'm looking at here.

My question for you all.....I ended up getting a monetary gift from my parents years ago and was able to pay off all these loans in full. They are currently all paid off and closed and this is reflected on the credit report but they still show as negative/delinquent. They were paid off in 2015 but my understanding is I need to wait 7 years  before they drop of my credit report. I don't have any other debt and I pay off my credit card in full each month. How likely is it, if I dispute these Department of Education loans, that the DOE will go ahead and resolve the dispute?

My understanding is it's entirely up to them. My biggest concern is if I dispute them and the DOE says no, is that it could negatively impact my credit score and drop it down thus making it harder to get a good interest rate. Should I just leave this alone and hope for the best at 720 or is there any possibility that the DOE will resolve the dispute?

I was approved for a credit card of  $1,000 with zero interest for the first 12 months, at an interest rate  that's 5% lower than the 1st credit card. The cost of transferring  $1,000 debt every year is significantly lower than the total amount of  interest I would pay off if I kept everything on the 1st card.

My other concern is that I'll bring my credit score down even lower by doing this. I'm afraid that opening this account then instantly maxing out the credit amount (and continuing to do so for the next 4 or so years) will hurt my credit score more than it can improve it.

During my time in the military, I've picked up a good amount of certifications including CISSP and CEH. I had originally planned to reclass to the new cyber branch, but it's already been confirmed that it will be impossible for me to receive a TS clearance. Not going to go into details but I'm lucky just to have the lower level clearance I do right now. 

Even for federal jobs with the DoD, CISA, and other agencies, it seems like all of the security related positions require a TS SCI...My only hope at continuing in this field is in the private sector. However, I'm not sure how well my skillset will be received by private employers. Should I just start looking into a career switch? Any advice on how to land a private sector job? Thanks.",technology

Bitcoin,Why I Bought Bitcoin,"In my opinion,The subprime mortgage crisis was caused by the unreasonable over-issuance of currency under loose monetary policy. In this case, if there is a currency that limits the total amount of issuance and can never exceed it, will there be no financial crisis or a series of chain problems such as currency devaluation?

In my opinion,Money is being issued faster than bitcoin is being produced.So the value of Bitcoin will continue to rise.

The decline in people's demand for cash has also affected investors' future expectations of encrypted digital currencies to a certain extent. According to a sample survey report released by the Bank of International Settlement (BIS) in 2020, more than 50% of central banks have developed central bank digital currency (CBDC) due to the decline in cash demand. This fully shows that encrypted digital currencies, whether legal or not, are very likely to change the existing capital market and even the currency system in the near future.

personalfinance,Pay off student loans or buy a house?,"I am graduating my bachelors degree next semester. My post-graduation plans of continuing education immediately has shifted gears. I plan on working for a few years right after bachelors and expect to make around 40k a year. Here are my current finances and bills. I have roughly $80,000 in my savings account. I have roughly $45,000 in federal student loans. I am getting married to my fiancé next year and plan for the wedding to cost around 15k. She is also graduating this year and is expected to make about 40k a year. That’s 80k combined annual salary. She has roughly 25,000 in student loan debt. We currently pay 600/month in rent and keep our bills very low. I am unsure which would be the wiser option, as we are considering buying a house. should we pay off all our student loan debt, work for a few years to build back up a savings account for a down payment on a house, then purchase a home? Or, do you think it would be a better idea to make the minimum payments on our student loans+ a few hundred extra monthly to knock the loans down faster but not at once, leaving enough for a down payment on a house and adding a mortgage payment onto already said-debt, to start building equity? Any insight is greatly appreciated and valued.

economy,Opinion: why most countries shouldn't have nosedived into the lockdown,"Lockdowns slowed down so many economies around the globe. Many countries have negative GDP growth rates as a result of the lockdowns. What I believe is that most governments were too hasty in jumping in into a lockdown. This resulted in healthy people staying at home &amp; ultimately becoming less &amp; less cautious about the virus. An alternative would've been to delay the lockdowns till the growth in the cases was noticeable. Then slowly increase the restrains. That would've stopped the economy from slowing down to this extent &amp; the people would've also been more cautious since they would've had a few people from their own contacts suffer from COVID. This would have achieved both the public co-operation &amp; a significantly lesser decline in the economies around the globe. Thus, I believe that most of the governments were way too hasty in implementing the lockdowns which ultimately led to people getting fed up &amp; non-compliant and also huge economic downturns. You don't lockdown the healthy folks. It's never a good idea. Lockdown the ones who are sick, this is why South Korea succeeded without many major lockdowns.",finance

Property is fully paid for and we are currently not looking to sell.

General figures:
 - we would like to take out ~30% of the properties value

I believe we’re all capable, responsible, and mature enough to live in a house together. We get along extremely well since we’ve been best friends for many years. 

Currently we’re all in community college receiving free tuition, paying little fees here and there. (Every class is online) 2 of us already have jobs while the other 2 (including myself) are planning on getting jobs in the near future. We all have a good amount saved up. We all have cars. 

I’m currently working towards a real estate license and plan to begin my real estate career as soon as next year.

I still plan on getting a regular job though keep the income going.

My plan is to get a FHA loan with a co-signer (close family relative) on a house with the money I will have saved up as down payment, and have the monthly expenses split 4 ways. (including savings for any unexpected house repairs) I currently have around $20k and aim to have 40k for the down payment. We live in California so I think “rent” would be around $500/mo per person. This “rent” also depends on how much the house is going to cost as well and after some market watching for months the house we’re going to be looking for is about $270k to $350k. (I’m hoping to find a good deal when time comes. Heck, I’m hoping prices drop but knowing the FED there is only a small chance) 

We would live in the house together while going to college and grinding our way towards financial independence. They are committed but if anything comes up that leads to some of them moving out I am ready to take action on that. I could bring in other capable best friends of ours, have us all move back home and rent out the house to tenants, and even sell it if it comes to worse.

If you believe in AMD's 3 year plan, getting in at this price may be a good opportunity. The price of AMD hasn't been this lost since July 30 when it broke through the resistance at 60 and then surged to 95 based on big earnings and INTC's poor results.

The entire market seems volatile because of the recent JPow messaging on 0% interest rates through 2023. Its understandable to be skittish.

But as a long term hold, I feel confident that AMD will see the 90's again within 1 year, which makes a nice 1 year hold to benefit from capital gains.

The main risk is the news that broke recently that Sony has cut back production estimates on PS5 due to yield issues with AMD CPUs through manufacturing.

personalfinance,401k loans - am I thinking about them the right way?,"Quick financial summary: I am a Canadian 24 year old working for a firm in NY. I make 90k a year base and have worked for just over a year. I have 30k in a TFSA, 13k in IRA, 5k HSA, and 21k in my 401k.

With all the investments I'm pretty levered and have some short run liquidity needs, but still see the advantage in maxing my 401k contribution because I plan on going to grad school and therefore expect to be able to withdraw from my 401k with relatively little tax liability. I also have essentially no ability to borrow other than credit cards becase I have no US credit history and can't provide Canadian income verification :/. My current marginal tax rate is 35%.

Actual question: 

I estimate the cost of debt from withdrawing from my 401k as being 3.5%. This is from:

&amp;#x200B;

35% (marginal tax rate) x 4.5% (401k interest rate) + 2% (return on money market) = 3.5%.

This is because the tax money is essentially just gone, and the return on money market is the opportunity cost of taking funds out of the plan (IE lost investment return).

&amp;#x200B;

Also, is my understanding correct that principle payments come out pre-tax? Therefore my pay stub would look something like:

3500 (gross pay) -

401k contribution, health insurance ect -

principle payment on 401k loan 

= taxable income

\- interest payment on 401k loan?

personalfinance,PenFed 5/5 ARM Rate Reset - The Process,"A while back, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/duxqoy/does_penfed_still_do_the_55_arm_rate_reset_offer/) about the process to do a preliminary/early rate reset for PenFed's 5/5 ARM and if they still do that. And actually, it appears someone else asked a [similar question](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i7xxrh/penfed_55_arm_rate_reset/) just recently. 

Here is my experience: (Reddit won't let me update the original post)

I did get an answer to the question ""do they still do early rate resets"". And the answer was ""No"". They do not do that  anymore (where they offer the rate reset to you). I asked if I could  *request* a rate reset, like right now on the phone (I was in contact with them by phone and email about 6 months ago asking these  questions, like right when the 5yr treasury rates were dropping  like crazy due to Rona). And they said No to that as well. But they did  confirm for me the exact dates and details of the rate reset for the 5/5 ARM. The rate that will be used for the next 5 years will commit/lock 45 days  before the 5 year anniversary of the loan. So my loan anniversary date is Aug 1st. And so the rate will lock on June 15th. The rate they use is the **1 week average 5 year constant maturity T-bill**. See this link for where I  get my numbers for reference.  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=WGS5YR,DGS5](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=WGS5YR,DGS5), Hopefully that shows up.  I assume it will be the value from the trailing week. (in my case June  12th, 2020). They round to the nearest 1/8th of a point. (i thought it would be ceiling(), but it's round(), so that's cool). My rate was 3% for the first 5 years, and the 5 yr constant maturity T-bill 1 week avg was 0.37 on June 12th. So that rounds to 3/8 (.375%). Add in the  margin (2%). So my new rate starting Aug 1st was 2.375%.  You actually pay in arrears for the previous month's billing. So my new payment was actually due Sept 1st. And my auto-withdrawal date was actually on Sept 10th. 

Bonus confusion: Penfed has a new mortgage dashboard online system and it appears to have F'd all sorts of things up. So they are still straightening this stuff out. But that's what I've been told is supposed to happen. 

Aug 1st 2015, i sign new 5/5 ARM with Penfed. 

Jun 15 (june 12th) 2020, look at the previous end of week, 5yr const maturity T-bill weekly avg

Aug 1st 2020, The rate officially resets

Sept 1st 2020, the new payment actually starts. Your auto-withdrawal date might be a few days after that.",finance

business,5 things executives need to know about AI and machine learning : Imperial College,"&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/lo8vhch56rn51.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a705a82d31ac7008fff30aeeb6bdc08af0fbb00)

Financial services firms expect significant growth in their use of machine learning, but are already having problems implementing it at scale

Executives responsible for technology strategy are receiving mixed messages about artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.  

A Bank of England  survey found that [**financial services firms expect significant growth in the use of machine learning over the next three years**](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/report/2019/machine-learning-in-uk-financial-services.pdf). Firms are investing in machine learning to automate decision making; they hope to save time and cut costs, reduce the potential for human error and potentially produce new insights from company data that can be exploited for commercial advantage.   

But such optimism contrasts with reports that firms are facing significant challenges trying to implement machine learning models at scale. Gartner [**captured this sentiment** ](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-02-13-gartner-says-nearly-half-of-cios-are-planning-to-deploy-artificial-intelligence)with the dramatic prediction that “through 2022, 85 per cent of AI projects will deliver erroneous outcomes due to bias in data, algorithms or the teams responsible for managing them”. 

The key to making good decisions about AI and machine learning – and avoiding expensive failures – is to understand the current state of the technology, where it works well, and where it doesn’t.  

Here are five fundamentals executives should know about AI and machine learning:  

#### 1. AI and machine learning are different 

It is important to understand the difference between AI and machine learning to help differentiate between marketing puff and real use cases.   

AI is concerned with creating computer systems that can mimic, perhaps even improve on, the way humans think. Though the term has become ubiquitous, ""AI” remains a long-term vision rather than something that is here today.  

Machine learning is a subcategory of AI and describes algorithms that have been designed with a particular goal in mind: to fit models or recognise patterns from data without being explicitly programmed and with limited or no human intervention.  

Machine learning is an important incremental step toward artificial intelligence, it is already here, and it has many applications: it is, for example, used by search engines to rank results.  

#### 2. How to train your algorithm 

Machine learning algorithms have been applied very effectively to play games without human input: you may have read about [**Google’s AlphaGo**](https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far), a system that beat the world’s top human player at the game Go. The important thing to realise is that a game like Go, although very complex, has clear rules and a clear end goal. Machine learning excels at detecting patterns in data and works very well when applied to logical systems like games where the algorithm can systematically work through a range of actions until it lands on the action that results in the greatest reward.   

A recent study by Imperial researchers in Nature demonstrated how machine learning algorithms can be very effective decision support tools when trained to identify the right answer. The study showed[ **they were able to correctly identify breast cancers from scan images**](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/194506/artificial-intelligence-could-help-spot-breast/) with a similar degree of accuracy to expert radiologists. 

&gt;*""AI” remains a long-term vision rather than something that is here today*

In a finance context, machine learning algorithms have helped firms make sense of noisy and complex data sets. For example, they have been employed successfully to help analysts distil hundreds of potential indicators of future investment returns to a few, more robust, measures. 

Machine learning may therefore work well and support decision making if you know what you are looking for, where to look for it, and why you are looking for it, but the task is currently very hard for a human (e.g. because there is too much data, the task is repetitive, there are too many potential scenarios for a human to compute, or the data is noisy so it is hard to distinguish significant patterns from anomalous ones). 

#### 3. Machines aren’t (yet) a substitute for human reasoning  

It is currently much more challenging to use machine learning to support automated decision making in uncertain environments. While algorithms excel at identifying relationships and patterns, they cannot evaluate whether such correlations are legitimate. So it can be dangerous to use machine learning algorithms to solve problems where there is no obvious “right” answer or doubts over causation. 

This challenge comes to the fore in finance when we try to establish deep economic associations from data and answer questions such as: “At what point do highly leveraged companies stop investing?” or “How will a rise in interest rates impact economic growth?” 

We could develop an algorithm to identify patterns in historic data sets to answer these questions and it may well spot interesting relationships for further analysis. However, it would be dangerous to rely on such algorithms as a basis for decision making. A machine-learning algorithm would only spot patterns and would not give enough indication of the underlying economic mechanisms that caused them.  

#### 4. Good algorithms start with good data  

Machine learning can create unreliable results if applied to small data sets or data sets that are biased. Many of the finance practitioners I speak to have trouble generating enough data of the right quality. It is a misconception that all areas of the finance industry are awash with data. This is true in transactional areas such as payments, but, in contrast, it is very hard for an analyst who typically works from company quarterly reports to collate enough data to build a statistically robust machine-learning model. Likewise, it is difficult to construct robust investment portfolios when using monthly data. 

We also struggle to produce algorithms that do not create implicit biases in contexts where privacy and fairness are important. My colleague Tarun Ramadorai has written an interesting piece about [**machine learning unfairness in mortgage lending decisions**](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/blogs/ib-knowledge/objective-unfairness-impact-machine-learning-mortgage-lending-decisions/).  

#### 5. Machine learning can be applied to more than just numbers 

Despite the challenges, I believe there are opportunities to use machine learning to improve financial decision making.  

Advances in textual analysis mean there are growing opportunities to apply machine learning to data sets that combine text and numbers. I am working on a project that is analysing millions of words of analysts’ reports to compare what analysts say to various audiences with what the numbers objectively tell us. Academics often tend to equate the two types of data as effectively delivering similar information and assume that people respond to them in the same way, but this may not be true in the real world. 

Algorithms are also increasingly being applied to analyse images. Such applications in the finance sector could create more timely and reliable data for analysts. We could, for example, foresee an analyst using real-time satellite imagery of the number of cranes being put up across a city to measure levels of construction activity – producing information in advance of industry surveys.

#### Using machine learning for competitive advantage  

We are moving from a period of hype and excitement about the potential of machine learning to a period of reflection and realism where implementation challenges such as ethical and regulatory considerations will come to the fore. If we think about the potential use of “robo advisors” in finance, for example, there is an interesting discussion to be had around whether an algorithm can truly be objective and how such products should be presented to consumers and supervised. There are also exciting, but also ethically challenging, opportunities to use data from other sectors such as climate or health data in financial decision making.  

I believe the firms that gain a competitive advantage through their use of machine learning in the next few years will do so because they have access to novel data sets. After all, the leadership of companies such as Amazon and Google in machine learning is built on their access to massive proprietary data sets.  

For executives making technology investment decisions, it will be of increasing importance to understand what machine learning and other AI technologies can do right now, and what uses are still a long way from being implementable. Above all, to succeed at machine learning, companies must frame the right questions and have access to the right data.

personalfinance,Am I being reasonable with my car selling price?,"I have a 2010 Toyota Corolla S sedan and wanting to sell it since I work from home now and won't be driving as much. I wanted to get at least $5500+ on it since my dad worked super hard to replaced my CV axle and did other maintenance on it. I currently listed as $6000 OBO but wanted to see if the price I listed is reasonable or am I undercutting myself since Toyota Corolla can be driven for many more years. I am in no rush to sell it but wanted to see how much I can get out of selling it.

These are the specs

* Driven 115,000 miles
* Automatic transmission
* Exterior color: Silver · Interior color: Black

**Description**

* Car in good condition.
* Regular maintenance like oil change, tire rotation, alignment, transmission fluid etc.
* Non-smoker; No pets
* All four tires have been replaced Jan 2020
* New battery replaced July 2019
* New CV axle driver and passenger side replaced Sept 2020
* New brake pads/rotors replaced Sept 2020
* Had 3 accidents on it a few years back, none related to the engine, just on the side doors, and rear bumper.

I'm the only owner since it was bought back in 2009 from the Toyota dealership. I recently spent $1000+ on replacing new items (see above description).

Some paint cosmetics needs to be repair, like the driver and rear passenger, scuffed/scratches on the front bumper, and small damage on back bumper but driving is great, really smooth.

So is selling it for $5500 reasonable? Or is it really not worth much? Any thoughts or opinions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance

stocks,"Here is a MArket Recap for today, Sept 17, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, Sept 17, 2020**

Stocks ended sharply down in a volatile trading session, as investors and traders became more cautious following the Federal Reserve’s announcement yesterday and conflicting information and timeframes regarding a potential coronavirus vaccine.

The sell-off was led by big tech stocks, like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Apple (AAPL), which extended yesterday’s losses and soured overall market sentiment. It appears that after the historic rally in August and since the March bottom, traders are rethinking the prospects of a continued, sharp economic recovery in the face of no additional fiscal stimulus. The volatility this month highlights the effects this still-raging pandemic has on the economy. 

Another 860,000 workers filed for unemployment claims this week, with claims remaining below 1 million for a third straight week. The number of unemployed persons also fell below 13 million, an encouraging sign for a recovering labor market.  

Fed officials upgraded their economic projections for this year, and now anticipate a shallower decline in real GDP and a lower unemployment rate by year-end versus their early-summer projections. Still, officials suggested that the quicker-than-expected early economic recovery could be jeopardized in absence of further fiscal stimulus. Powell said, “It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.” Again, Powell is urging Congressional lawmakers to pass additional fiscal stimulus.

The expiration of the CARES Act and enhanced unemployment benefits have left millions of Americans unemployed and without support in the middle of a pandemic. While the stock market is okay (relatively), Powell and other FOMC members have stressed the financial burden this pandemic has placed on small businesses and individuals, urging Congress to pass more fiscal stimulus. 

President Trump agrees with Powell and on Wednesday called on congressional Republicans to support a massive economic relief bill with “much higher numbers” and stimulus payments for Americans, abruptly proposing an entirely different plan from what the Senate GOP sought to advance in recent days. Trump advocated for the $1.5 trillion plan unveiled by the bipartisan house committee, the Problem Solvers Caucus.  The proposal includes a new round of $1,200 stimulus checks to individual Americans, a provision omitted from an approximately $300 billion plan Senate Republicans tried unsuccessfully to pass last week. Pres. Trump said, “I like the larger amount, I’ve said that. Some of the Republicans disagree, but I think I can convince them to go along with that because I like the larger number. I want to see people get money.”

Trump’s claim yesterday that a coronavirus vaccine could be ready by November went against statements made the same day by Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC. Redfield said he does not expect a vaccine to be ‘widely available’ until the third quarter of next year. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows responded by saying “not sure where Dr. Redfield got his particular timetable, but it’s not based on those that are closest to the process.” In response, the WHO said, “It is important  we have consistent messaging by officials worldwide”.

In an unfortunate development, WHO officials warned that the spread of coronavirus in Europe now is worse than it was in March, near the start of the pandemic. Europe has reported 300,000 cases in one week, the highest 7-day total since the start of the pandemic. In total, Europe has reported about 4.9 million coronavirus cases and 226,524 deaths.

personalfinance,Credit Card Utilization % Thresholds (Total Available vs Individual Cards),"I know the general rule of thumb is to keep credit utilization on cards below 30%. But if you are over that on 1 or more cards, are there thresholds for total utilization and individual utilization that have an effect on your credit score in the mid-term (3 to 6 months)? 

Example: You have 5 cards with a combined utilization of 45%.  Three cards are low utilization (2%, 5%, 15%) and two cards are HIGH utilization. **Card A**  had 65% utilization and **Card B** has 74% utilization.

Is it better to spread the amount around even though it wouldn't affect your total utilization? Would matter if I transferred some of the balance of **Card A** to **Card B** for a 0% balance transfer? Does that change if it brings **Card B** to *95% utilization*?

If the individual balances matter are their thresholds within the % that affect credit score? (ex: 90% and above, 75%  to 89%,  above 50%, 30% to 50%, etc).

\*I know that from a holistic perspective interest rates &amp; fees have a lot to do with wether or not balance transfers make sense. But I am asking just about the effect on credit score.",finance

financialindependence,The Big Budget Scare - That 70% Post-Retirement Spending Target,"TLDR: The ""guidelines"" that financial advisors and writers push to try help us estimate the percentage of our pre-retirement income we'll need in retirement were TOTALLY useless for us. I suspect they will be as well for other high earners who also live in very high cost of living areas but plan to relocate to lower cost areas once they are no longer tied to a job. We may be an extreme case, but have entirely maintained our pre-retirement standard of living on 25% of our pre-retirement income.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I retired early 2019, 50/55 years old. We were never officially trying to FIRE, but did have the idea that when our last of four children left the nest, it would be pretty cool to pull the plug. We beat that soft ""goal"" by a year.

There's so much energy spent focusing on SWR (and the resulting ""nest egg"" one needs to retire) but that part didn't make us nervous (thanks Big ERN!). What kept me up at night was the incredibly crappy information out there about what budget level we should plan for. We read over and over that one should try to target 70% of pre-retirement income. Some sources acknowledged that \*maybe\* one might get by with less...maybe as low as 50%. But the problem we had was when we ran the budgets, we felt we could live comfortably on \~25% of our pre-retirement earnings (around $360k+). And though I searched, I couldn't find any similar case studies out there.

Our resulting budget of $90K was a number we knew we could live on. (Duh...no one's going to starve on that!) But we didn't know if we'd feel like we were sacrificing vs. our previous lifestyle. (Travel is an important objective for us as we never had time to see much of the world while working and raising kids.)

18 months into retirement, I'm here to say it was EASILY doable. Zero standard of living decline.

How is that possible?

1. Moved from SF Bay to Spokane
2. Traded a mortgage on a $900K home (with something like $7k in property tax!) for a $235k home we bought with cash (and around $2.5K property tax).
3. No more retirement savings. (We had been maxing out our 401ks for years.)
4. We raised four children and now have few kid related expenses. (We're lucky that they're proving quite industrious in building their careers.)
5. No more commuting. (Both my wife and I had long expensive commutes in the Bay Area) and we own fewer cars (less maintenance/insurance, etc.)
6. No state income tax (WA vs. CA)
7. Very low federal tax (we have enough after-tax cash that we may never go over the 12% marginal tax rate again)
8. Lower cost of living in general in Spokane (utilities, restaurants, contractors, really everything)
9. We were so busy with demanding jobs pre-retirement that we ate out a ton and had a housekeeper. We still eat out but no where near as much and don't need a housekeeper
10. We have time to search for travel ""deals"" and travel off-peak for our vacations
11. Almost zero new clothes budget...and none for work
12. And starting next year: Very heavy ACA subsidies due to managing our income carefully

We would have been a lot less stressed if we had seen anyone living happily on 25% of pre-retirement income. I would bet some of the extreme FIRE folks here plan to do it because they are saving such a high percentage of current income. But that wasn't the case with us.

I hope this makes someone a little less nervous if their budget for FIRE seems comfortable under 50% of pre-retirement income.

What's your budget target? Anyone else in the 25% range? (We might go lower after those ACA credits kick in next year. We paid a whopping $1700/mo for COBRA this year!)",finance

stocks,Wells Fargo: An Unbelievable Discount for a Can't-Fail Business,"Wells Fargo has seemingly gone from one of America's most reliable and respected banks to one of its most maligned and mistrusted companies in a mere four years, and the stock price has certainly reflected that fact. Since September of 2016, when the public first became aware of the company's fake accounts scandal, shares have dropped by over 45%, the company is on its fourth different CEO, they announced a dividend cut for the first time since the great recession, they've been fined $150 million to go along with a $3 billion legal settlement, and regulators have instituted an unprecedented asset cap on the bank as a punishment. It's gotten to the point where even Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, loyal shareholders for over 30 years, have reduced their position by over 60% since the end of last year.

Buy the stock.

Many investors seem to have an aversion to buying stocks in companies that are struggling, despite this sentiment going directly against some of the most timeless investment advice ever from Benjamin Graham: ""the intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists"". Perhaps this quote didn't do well enough to acknowledge that pessimists have *reason* to be pessimistic in most cases. A good investment, therefore, isn't a company with no struggles, but one whose struggles are overstated within the market price. This is the case with WFC.

While the bank's asset cap and the federal funds rate hitting 0% again have been major headwinds for Wells, this presents the best buying opportunity to get into the very favorable financials industry since the Great Recession. For the first time in what feels like forever, the bank has management in place with a realistic view of the challenges faced by the company and an actual plan to overcome those challenges and once again return to growth. New CEO Charlie Scharf has outlined plans to remove the asset cap, cut costs by $10 billion (for what's already amongst the most capitally efficient banks in America), and repair the bank's reputation in the eyes of consumers.

While we're on the subject of Scharf, I'd like to convey just how impressive his résumé is, and how excited WFC shareholders should be about the hire. Scharf began his management career working alongside business legends Jamie Dimon, Sandy Weill, and Bob Lipp, helping the three build Commercial Credit, which turned into Travelers Group, then Citigroup. After following Dimon in his move to Chase Bank, Scharf eventually became the CEO of Visa, where he had a phenomenal run before stepping down to work at the Bank of New Yerk Mellon. There, at BNY, he was referred to as the ""best CEO of the bank since Alexander Hamilton"". During his time with Visa and BNY, he likely worked closely at times with Warren Buffett, as Berkshire Hathaway had large stakes in each company. As a board member at Microsoft, he probably spent much time working alongside another legendary capitalist in Bill Gates. To put it simply, Scharf has spent his entire career learning from legends and titans of industry, and success seems to follow him wherever he goes. If anyone can turn around the trajectory of Wells Fargo, it's Charlie Scharf.

Frankly, however, I'd likely be bullish on the stock regardless of the CEO's credentials. In the words of Peter Lynch ""Go for a business that any idiot can run - because sooner or later any idiot is probably going to run it."" Since the global financial crisis, all banks with over $50 billion in assets go through regular stress tests from the Federal Reserve. Banks are probably the most regulated companies in American capitalism. To put it bluntly, it's damn near impossible to destroy a company that's micromanaged by the federal government at every turn, and in the event that it does happen, Wells Fargo is designated as ""too big to fail"" and would be the recipient of a government bailout in a heartbeat. Scharf's technical experience and leadership ability are bonuses, not requirements.

So, with all of that being said, what do WFC's future prospects actually look like? The remainder of 2020 and the whole of 2021 are likely to be very tough times for the entire economy, and banks are no different in that regard. Furthermore, given the asset cap restricting the growth of the bank, Wells likely won't return to 2019 levels of earnings until 2023. Wells Fargo is a stock for long-term investors to say the least. After that, however, let's presume that under the visionary leadership of Scharf and by factoring in share buybacks, the bank increases earnings per share at a rate slightly above average for the broader banking industry (typically 9% per year), and grows by 9.5% per year. If everything goes according to plan, the bank's EPS could grow beyond $10 by 2030. ""If everything goes to plan"" is a very dangerous game to play when investing, I will concede, but if my prediction is accurate, and we assume a future P/E of 15.5, the stock would increase to a level of $155+/share by that point, signaling upside of about 560% by 2030 before factoring in dividends. That equates to over 20% annualized ROI.

I'll say it again: buy the stock.",finance

personalfinance,Military - Pay off home early?,"Howdy everyone.

I'm active duty Air Force and make around $56,000 before taxes. I have no debt besides my mortgage and I'm currently investing 15% into my Roth TSP with a 5% match. I am also working on my emergency fund of $10,000+, which I should have here in about 2-3 months. My wife is a stay at home mom and we're a single income household. I have transferred my Post 9/11 G.I. Bill to my daughter, so her college is taken care of. Therefore, my focus is paying off my home early and just generalized saving.

I bought a home using the VA loan at my new assignment, just over a year ago. The house was $135,000 and the current payment is only about a quarter of my monthly take home pay. Currently I am in a refinance to take advantage of the low interest rates from the pandemic and the $34,000 of debt I finally paid off this year, lowered my interest rate from 4.35 to 2.75%. This will make my monthly mortgage payment about $250 less per month.

Being in the military, there is always a chance we'll move again within 2-4 years. Therefore, my question is; Knowing I may not be living in this house for 5+ years, should I bother adding extra principal payments to pay off the mortgage earlier? With the fairly large amount of wiggle room in my budget I can have the house paid off 15+ years early.

If my family and I do move, the current plan is to rent out the property. It's very close to the base I'm stationed at and finding a tenant shouldn't be an issue.",finance
personalfinance,Just found out that I've been the victim of bank fraud again for the 4th time. At least it's nothing insane like the last time.,"So, I need to give some background because 4 times seems like a lot and no, the last three weren't my fault. (I clearly won some unlucky lottery though.) I'll take a little bit of the blame this time for missing something like this for this long, I still have no idea how I missed it. The wife and I are already making a much more strict budgeting plan to make sure this doesn't happen again. Good thing she's good with money lol.

Also, I mention my wife, but this is my personal account. She's not attached to, or effected by this in anyway other than me generally having less money each month.

The first time my card info got stolen from a pizza place I ordered from when I was out of town. dude used my card number to buy like 1000$ worth of stuff from Gamestop, while I was on a bus back home. Bank caught it and reversed the charges. Changed bank card and pin. Checked credit and made sure that was all that was done.

Second time is when China hacked the DOD/government, and a bunch of us all had our information stolen. Nothing happened this time, but took steps to make sure of that as directed by my financial dept.

Third time was silly, I guess someone stole my info again (card readers that go over the gas pump things) but, the joke was on him because I was completely broke and only had like 87 cents to my name so that got caught the person trying to buy like 600$ worth of things from a walmart in my area, my bank handled really quickly. Same thing as the first time, new card and new pin. credit check, ect. Which brings us to now.

This afternoon while I was getting ready for work, I checked my account to make sure I had enough to get gas, and I had a random pending authorization hold for like 27 bucks. I had seen this memo line before, but I was real curious about it since I hadn't spent money and all my bills are paid up this month. After a quick google search, and a quick advanced search of my account, it turns out I had been paying for a subscription to some site called ""truthfinder"" and it totaled out to be 37 a month broken up into 3 different payments. I went back as far as time would allow me to look before going to work, and it went back at least to June of 2018. I couldn't check any further tonight now that I'm home, because of bank site maintenance. I'll update just how long once that's done. This is how it is broken up: one charge for 27, and two other for 5. The way it appeared to me the other time I had seen these charges seemed like something in the range I normally pay for, dismissed it, and since it's mixed in with my other usual purchases that are all around the same prices, so they were basically ""lost in the sauce"" so to speak. Again my fault here, I should have realized right then and there, but the damage is done now, I can only try harder to make sure this doesn't happen again.

So, here is where I'm a little confused. I've dealt with major purchases and having that detected and handled, but I'm not exactly sure how to go about telling my bank fraud department about this. I imagine to them it just looks like I've been paying for this for so long that it's something that I actually used before. In reality,  I've never heard of this site before. Yesterday before work I tried entering my 2 emails (actual email, and email for my game subscriptions like Xbox live and Steam purchases.) to see if I was dumb enough to use this site when I was bored and on a bender. Nothing. Neither of my emails came back with anything from them. Leaving me to assume that this clearly wasn't from me at all.

Here are my questions:

1. How do I explain to my bank that I've never heard of, or ever used this site I've been apparently paying for?
2. What are my steps to take outside of what I'm already going to do to stop these charges from continuing
3. is there any hope that I'll see any of this money come back to me?
4. If there is, are there limits to how far back the banks can go to reverse this kind of thing?
5. Are there any major questions I need to ask my bank about when I go in tomorrow?

I'm just about done with this bank, so as soon as this matter is handled I'll be changing over to another bank like USAA, NavyFed, or SkyOneCU. The perks aren't worth it for me anymore to stay with this bank, so it's time to cut ties when this is all over.

If you need anymore information, I'll be happy to provide it with as much as I can with the info I have thus far.

personalfinance,Best way to move from bank to credit union and how to manage savings accounts for children?,"Hi, I apologize if this is common knowledge. I am a lurker but have specific questions and hoping for some advice about my banking and savings.

I currently use Wells Fargo but am finally fed up with the bank and now the fees they will charge for my checking accounts. 

I recently refinanced my mortgage with a credit union and opened a checking and savings account with the credit union. I decided that I am going to move my funds to the credit union. 

How do I go about moving all of my funds from Wells Fargo? I would prefer to not cash out and literally walk my funds from one bank to the other. I was not sure if that was my only option? I have a total of 5 accounts (two checking and 3 savings). I have two checking accounts because my SO and I do not merge our funds other than a “bills” account we fund according to our budget.

personalfinance,What to do with student loans,"29y male.
I currently have 41k in principal, and 2.5k in interest on my student loans. I work for a fed government, and am working towards my pslf. However I only have 1 year in, and I’m not sure if, since Covid, these $0 payments since March count towards this as qualifying payments. I’ve paid a little here and there, nothing substantial. I don’t have a car payment, I’ve been working from home, don’t have to pay for housing currently, and no cc debt. I make 34k right now, but with raises I’ll be around 39k in 2 weeks, my yearly raise, however I apply to jobs every week, and I usually only qualify for the ones making 43k. Atleast for right now.

I’m accruing roughly $7 a day on them in interest.

I admit I should have so much more saved, but only have about 6.5k saved right now, but I’ve lately been trying to budget better recently. I had a bit more until I paid off my cc’s.

Should I pay a few grand on the student loans right now? I’m not sure if it would be worth it to drain my savings and it still end up accruing a lot of interest after.",finance

personalfinance,The state of Federal tax processing this year is yet another reminder that you should constantly adjust your paycheck withholding,"Adjusting your withholding to not pay extra taxes during the year is standard advice, but people always reply and say that they like receiving the “bonus” checks in April, and that they would just have spent it all otherwise. This is already a bad idea since you are giving the government an interest-free loan, but this year the IRS is so backed up that a ton of people still haven’t received their refunds even after filing as early as March. There are threads about it on this sub every day, and the only advice is to just wait longer. That is money that could have been in your pocket in January 2019, but almost two years later is still stuck in limbo.

Make the tiniest bit of effort and file an updated W-4. There are a ton of calculators and estimators for it online. The extra cash can immediately go into your 401k/IRA or even just sit in your bank account for emergencies.

solar,Got a 8.64kW system. How's the price look? I'm on the fence.,"(western Washington State)

Hey, I know this kind of question gets asked all the time, but I got a quote that is fairly close to being affordable now and curious what the communities thoughts are on it.

My goal on solar is to try and pay about the same I do now, but produce our own energy.  I'm also a big fan of producing out own electricity in general.  We do own a PHEV and expect to get a full EV in the future.  We have an electric mower and pretty much electric everything, although still on gas furnace.  Lastly, the system allows for expansion later on.

Size: 8.64kWPanels: Q Cells 320wInverter: Enphase Micro-InvertersRacking System: IronRidge XR100 (black)Mounting System: IronRidge FlashFoot2 (black)Monitoring: Enphase IQ Combiner w/Envoy

Total cost before any incentives: $27,490

Cost breakdown:Electrical Panel Upgrade: $3,885 (required since I have very old electrical panel)

Solar Panel install: $23,605

&amp;#x200B;

Incentives/credits:Starting price: $27,490Promo discount (from the install company): -$1,500Federal Tax Credit: -$6,757Downpayment: -$3,000 (basically paying cash to cover the cost of the electrical panel upgrade)

Total To be Financed: $16,233

I'm looking at 20 years loans at either 3.5% or 4%

&amp;#x200B;

My current electrical bill averages to be about $124/month right now

Estimated monthly savings with the solar panel system is $70/month

Estimated loan payment after federal credit, etc: $97.52/month.

Total new payment for electricity: $151 (utility company $54 + solar loan $97)

So it's about $27 more per month.  Estimated home value increase is about $2 per wat, so roughly $16k.  We intend to live here for 5 to 10 years (most likely 10).

I haven't found out if they can negotiate the price a bit lower or not (is that a thing with solar?).

personalfinance,Leave State Job for Federal Job,"I am having a hard debate with myself. I currently work for a school system where I have lower pay than private, but likely way more benefits. I make about $60k, but I have free medical (with $5500 HSA deposit, which equals the deductible), free dental, life, and vision. In a couple of years, I will also have my retirement 100% paid for, which equals %10 of my salary. So, I bring home most of my paycheck, except for federal, state, and local taxes. I also get 23 days PTO and 7 holidays.

On the other hand, I can go to a federal position that pays about $80k, but now, I have to pay for medical, dental, life, vision, etc. I also have to pay 4.4% to FERS and the 7.65% for FICA. I also have the TSP contributions, which would need to be 5% to get the full match. Overall, it seems like my net pay would be 5-10% less and I would have worse health insurance. The retirement could possibly be better than what I currently have though.

As far as retirement, I have the state pension, which, if I retire at 60, would mean I get 76% of my final average salary for life. 86% if I buy my military years back. For the federal job, I get FERS (1% x average salary x years worked), the TSP (401k), and social security.

I am not sure which is the better option. I am very stable right now, but am looking for more. I know it is a higher salary, but the hit to the take home pay and benefits is making me think it is not worth it. Thoughts? Advice?",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap I wrote for today Sept 18, 2020","**PsychoMarket Recap - September 18, 2020**

Stocks dropped again today, closing out a volatile week on a sour note. Tech stocks continued pulling back, with many notable stocks breaking through well-established supports. In spite of the Fed’s commitment to keep interest rates low until 2023 and mostly positive economic data, the sell off in tech, which is the largest holding in the three major benchmarks, has dragged the market down. 

This week, tech stocks like Apple (AMZN), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have declined sharply after hitting consecutive record highs in August. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is the hardest hit, with prices at similar levels to early August. The S&amp;P finished the day 1.12% down, the Nasdaq 1.28% down, the Dow was 0.87% down.

After a historic August led by tech stocks, the current volatility in the market has sharply lowered investor sentiment and belief in the prospect of a sharp recovery for the virus-ravaged economy.The still raging pandemic, combined with no fiscal stimulus from Congress, has economists lowering expectations for the remainder of the year. In a note to clients today, Goldman Sachs (GS) said, “At this point, a major stimulus package before the election looks like a long shot and we expect Congress to leave at the end of September without extending the extra unemployment insurance payment, approving another round of stimulus payments, or providing additional support to small businesses or state and local governments. Failure to pass any additional fiscal measures would likely lead us to downgrade our growth estimates for Q4”

Economic data has been surprisingly good in spite of the circumstances. 860,000 people filed unemployment claims, while that’s a lot normally, it has been less than 1 million for the third week straight. Continuing Claims, which are the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, fell below 13 million for the first time since March highs, an encouraging sign. 

Confidence in the market, right now, is dependent on Congress passing more fiscal stimulus. Top FOMC officials, including Jerome Powell, and Pres. Trump have publicly endorsed the passage of more fiscal stimulus. Economists and politicians agree that more stimulus is needed to boost consumer confidence and provide much-needed support to cash-strapped families and small businesses.

investing,Does low interest rates really justify such high valuations?,"It seems that low interest rates is one of the reason why investors justify high valuations. Speculation aside, the price of the stock gives you claim for a set of long-term stream of cash flows. The more you pay for a stock, the less of a return (if you intend to be a long-term investor) you will receive.

I understand that low interest makes the denominator smaller which increases the valuation models. But doesn't the Federal Reserve lower interest rates because of a weakening economic forecast (cash flows/earnings are threatened)?

Doesn't high valuations  right now assume that future streams of cash flows are held constant (or higher) when interest rates are lowered? I am saying that future streams of cash flows are threatened in bad economic climates which has an offsetting impact to the benefits of low interest rates (more lending/spending).

I get the impression that people are playing hot potato with stocks right now. People are paying more for the stocks assuming that the other person would pay even more for it-they aren't interested in the future stream of cash flows.

Maybe the market is just pricing in future massive inflation? Because I don't get it.",finance

I’m [23F] based in the US, and I got accepted into a 5 years bachelors + masters program at a university, which means I could start working on my masters during my fourth year while I finish up my bachelors. 

Last spring was my last quarter as an undergrad, and I managed to complete my double degree in engineering (Computer Science) and the humanities within the four year span. I have no debt from my undergrad thanks to generous scholarships. My masters’ is in the humanities. 

This fifth and last year, I have run out of my grants and scholarships, and the tuition is 55k/year. I am eligible for ~75k in federal loans, one loan for 4.5% interest rate and the other for ~6%. 

As someone with no debts, a sudden 55k debt is very intimidating to me. Overall I have plenty of doubts. Firstly is that maybe a humanities masters’ degree won’t advantage me professionally in the long term and secondly that I am losing precious opportunity to work during the time I’m enrolled, especially since I am able to defer my enrollment for two years max. 

On the other end, I love my university institution and faculty and don’t want to lose this opportunity to stay a student while I still can... also the job market currently is not that good due to the pandemic from what I’ve experienced. 

I hope to pursue a PhD one day and had planned to work after doing my masters, and I don’t want to keep pushing back these plans and risk never getting to them.

personalfinance,How do you actually negotiate with mortgage lenders for a refinance and should I trust information on the loan estimates received?,"I've been shopping lenders for a mortgage refi. Currently have a 30-yr fixed at 4.25% interest rate; looking to get a 15-year fixed at 2.5% or less interest rate. I have great credit.

I'm in the process of getting different Loan Estimates (LE), but it's hard to do an apples to apples comparison because they're generated with different information (even though I’ve supplied the same information for all of them – same assets, income, same loan term requested, etc.). I got a LE from my current lender that included points (I guess it was assumed I was interested in buying points or maybe this is just how the lender does business? IDK). 
I received an LE from a different lender, and this included an interest rate without points. To do an even comparison, I asked my current lender to adjust the LE to exclude points.

While I'm doing this, in the back of my mind I'm wondering - how do you even literally negotiate? Do you negotiate specific items (interest rate, APR, overall loan amount, whether an appraisal is required, etc.)? Do you literally say ""hey this company is offering to do this without an appraisal, can you do the same?"" 

Do you literally negotiate every little item of your choosing? Is there an easier way? 

I was thinking of maybe just negotiating using the overall Loan Amount, APR, and interest rate offered. But the way the Loan Amount is calculated is confusing. For example, Rocket Mortgage provided me a Loan Amount that included new escrow account, first month’s payment. I don’t even know if the LE provided by my current lender includes this same information (I know I can ask that question, but GEEZ is there an easier way?!

It’s hard to trust information on the LE’s because I don’t know what other figures or fees are baked into the loan. It’s so shady, I’m getting tired of the process, and I’m tempted to just settle for my current lender since it seems easier.

I get the overall theme with negotiating - you compare all LEs and pick the one that provides the best terms, save the most $, then talk with the other lenders to see if they can match or provide a better offer. It’s the details that bog me down. Also, do you have to present the LE to other lenders when negotiating? 

TL;DR: ELI5 how do you negotiate with lenders when trying to refinance a mortgage loan, and how can I ensure that the LEs I get include the same exact variables?",finance

Payments aren't a problem, I always pay 2x minimum and usually make 2 payments when I can each month. I think best case I could pay this off in 36 months or so if I went hard on it.

I was offered a personal loan by a reputable company (Discover) for $35K at a 14.8% interest rate. No start up fees, no early payment penalties, no fees of any kind etc. Seems really good. Almost too good. repayment period is 36 months. Again the total monthly payment amount causes no issue.

Is a personal loan worse or better for your credit score than carrying large credit card debt? Current utilization is around 80% - the loan would obviously drop that to near 0% utilization but then create the personal loan. I'm asking what's better for my credit score - or does something seem fishy?  


I'm currently only seeing pro's to take the personal loan with no cons...lower interest, locked in repayment time frame (which I want). Almost seems too good.

I want to preface with that, because what he has asked me to do may sound sketchy, and I know he only has good intentions.

My dad has asked me if I could open up a checking and/or savings account under my name, and adding him as a secondary owner. He says he wants to put away money that is easily accessible to me so that if anything were to happen to him, I would have any issues accessing the money. He's 62, has been married to his wife for \~12 years. It doesn't sound like this is something he wants her to know about. Says it's not that he doesn't trust her, and he has other accounts and insurance with her as the primary beneficiary, but he thinks money can make people do stupid things and he wants to make sure that my brothers and I, along with our children, can divide up the money without issue. 

Having said all that, he's wanting to put $50-65k into these accounts he wants me to open. Putting his decision to keep this away from his wife, it doesn't make sense to me to put the money in a checking or regular savings account, as he even said he doesn't see the need to withdraw the money frequently or at any time soon. Knowing interest rates aren't the greatest right now, what kind of an account would be the best for this amount of money?

I don’t mKe enough income to get the dream infinite Visa card yet but I do qualify for the 2% cash back Visa card. It has a yearly fee of $35 and the interest rates are the norm. I feel like I will benefit from the cash back since I use my card for all my purchases but I’ve never switched cards while staying in the same bank before. Is there anything to consider? Will I be given a lower credit limit and have to build it up again? Will my credit be checked and in turn take a hard hit?",finance
personalfinance,Is it alright for me to pay $3000-3500 in rent?,"I’m a new college grad moving to NYC, and my compensation is the following:

- 118k Base Salary 
- 55k RSU/year 
- 10% target bonus, could be 1-3x this based on performance (~12k-36k) 
- Received a 100k signing bonus + 10k relocation (that I’m not really using so it’s basically a bonus), so about 65k in savings right now, but expect to have about 75k by the time I start paying rent
- 40k target stock refresher/year, could also be 1-3x this (~40k-120k), but this also vests over 4 years, so it’s not really a bonus 

My TC without the signing bonus or refreshers into account is about 185k. This all increases with promotion but let’s take everything worst case scenario, so 1x multiplier on the bonus/refresher grant and no promotions considered. When we go back into the office, my company will also have all meals of the day, so I don’t expect to pay too much for food later on. All insurances included for free (vision, dental, etc). I also have about $25k in student loan debt with an interest rate of about 3%, and I plan to make minimum payments 

My costs seem to be the following worst case:

- 3500 rent 
- 500 food (for the time being w/ Covid, should be close to 0 besides eating out when office opens)
- 200 utilities 
- 300 student loan (worst case?)
- 300 transportation (mostly gonna bike/walk but Ubers maybe) 
- 800 for fun (including eating out)

So this is about $5600 with about $6400 in take home pay NOT taking into account the bonus or the RSUs. Is it feasible for me to pay $3500 in rent? I don’t want to HAVE to sell stock to pay rent (though I’m going to do so anyway to diversify), as it could fluctuate. The 30% rule only counting my base salary puts me at $2950 per month. I’d like to max out my 401k, and it seems with budgeting I wouldn’t have to touch my RSUs and can save more than 50k (pretax) per year as long as the stock doesn’t die (one of FANG so doubt it). Could I comfortably pay $3500?",finance

investing,Is there any reputable research on the relationship between income inequality and market returns?,"I've had this sense that rising inequality is reflected in rising market returns. It isn't a well thought out sense, or one supported by a great deal of evidence. But I can't help but notice that when the inequality alarm is sounded the loudest in media and by politicians, it is during those times when the market is doing really well. This makes me think that there might be a predictable correlation between the two: When inequality goes up so does the market; when inequality goes down so does the market. 

I believe this might have implications for investing. If you can identify conditions that exacerbate inequality (like certain fed policies and certain commercial banking policies), then when those conditions arise at a given moment, you can view it as a signal to bet on the market as a whole.b

personalfinance,Best Buy financing option.. bad idea? I'd love to hear about your experiences/advice.,"I was considering using it for one single large purchase, something I desperately need for school. It'd be a 24 month payment plan at $41 per month.  

I can afford the monthly payments just fine and my credit is spectacular but I am paranoid I'd be making a huge mistake even though it seems fine to me after reading into it?  

The one thing I worry about is a couple stories where people said if they miss a payment they get charged a retroactive 35% interest rate or something like that. It's just like any other credit card, right? Where I log in and make a monthly payment before or on the listed due date with my debit card or bank card manually?

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 21st, 2020.

# **Markets are expected to be choppy, but dip buyers could be looking at tech favorites in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/markets-are-expected-to-be-choppy-but-dip-buyers-could-be-looking-at-tech-favorites-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; After another week of losses, tech could be at the heart of a tug of war as dip buyers look for bargains in some of their favorite names and others see the group as still too frothy.
*****
&gt; In the past week, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were both down about 0.6%, the third losing week. It was the S&amp;P 500′s longest losing streak since October. Tech was broadly lower, with Amazon and Facebook both down 5% for the week. Information technology shares lost 1% but communications which includes Facebook and Google fell 2.3% for the week.
*****
&gt; “I think every time you’ve had a significant pullback in the familiar names, that tends to draw in more money,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “You’ve had a little rotation toward value. That’s a healthy sign for the market. I don’t think that’s an unhealthy market even though stocks look pricey. Given how low interest rates are, stocks look like the only game in town.”
*****
&gt; There are also a number of Fed speeches, but the most important will be the appearances by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell before three Congressional committees. At two of those, Tuesday and Thursday, Powell appears with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to discuss coronavirus aid.
*****
&gt; Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said he does not expect much from Powell after his comments following the Fed’s meeting this week, though the central bank chairman is likely to once more tell Congress fiscal stimulus is needed to help the economy recover.
*****
&gt; Keon said it would be positive if there could be another stimulus deal but the market no longer expects it. “If we do get a deal, that would be really positive. I think at this point, there’s a little bit of a slowdown in news. We still have a ways to go before we get into earnings warnings season. We’re going to worry more about the presidential election and its aftermath,” said Keon.
*****
&gt; Keon said investors are increasingly focused on the election and the potential for an uncertain outcome, as states deal with large amounts of mailed ballots for the first time. He said the concern is it could take weeks or months to determine the outcome if the race is close.
*****
&gt; “It’s still six weeks to the election. We haven’t had the debates yet. That six weeks is a lifetime. Biden seems to be the favorite at this point, but I don’t think the market is betting on anything but higher volatility,” Keon said. President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden hold their first debate Sept. 29.
*****
&gt; “I think volatility is the norm, not the exception, until we get through the election,” said Hogan.
*****
&gt; Investors have been hedging against extended volatility after the election. Patrick Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options with Cardinal Capital, said the flow into S&amp;P 500 options for January has been steady over the past several days. “The options markets are implying a contested election that could last until January,” he said. He said the market is not positioning around one candidate or other, just uncertainty.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs strategists noted Friday that investors have pushed out some hedging further into November, though some investors appear to be betting on an outcome by Dec. 8, the date states with contested elections have to report.
*****
&gt; There are also a few important reports on the economic calendar, including housing data on existing home sales Tuesday and new home sales Thursday. “The housing market has been solid and hopefully, we’ll get confirmation of that because people were upset by the decline in housing starts,” said Hogan.
*****
&gt; Manufacturing PMI is released Wednesday and durable goods are reported Friday.

&gt; # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 2

&gt; As we noted last week, the demand for election charts is off the charts (pun intended), so we are sharing some of our favorite election charts.

&gt; Without further ado, here are some more election charts you need to know as November 3 inches closer.

&gt; How stocks perform three months before the election has a stellar track record of predicting who will win in November. If stocks are higher, the incumbent party tends to win, while if stocks are lower, the incumbent party tends to lose. This indicator accurately predicted the winner 87% of the time (20 of 23) since the late 1920s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.14.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Building on this, if President Donald Trump is going to win, right about now is when the S&amp;P 500 Index should start to outperform. Of course, if it weakens, it could mean we will be looking at a President Joe Biden soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.14.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Speaking of presidents up for re-election, here’s what the S&amp;P 500 historically has done during re-election years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.14.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, here are two final charts that may help forecast the outcome.

&gt; If real per capita disposable income is higher, the incumbent president usually wins. Conversely, if wages are weak, that bodes well for someone new in the White House. Given real per capita disposable income is up more than 7% this year, it would suggest President Trump should take more than 70% of the votes. Of course, this is greatly skewed due to the CARES Act, so we’d put a major asterisk next to this one.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.14.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; To sum up, Gallup poll approval ratings have done a nice job of predicting how many votes a president up for re-election might get. With a 42% Gallup approval rating currently, this comes out to 49% of the total votes for President Trump, which points to a close race.

&gt; # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 3

&gt; One of the top requests we’ve received the past few weeks is for more charts on the US elections. We shared some of our favorite in Election Charts You Need to See: Part 1 and Part 2, and today’s the third blog in our series on this important event.

&gt; S&amp;P 500 Index earnings are expected to jump close to 23% in 2021 according to FactSet, as the global economy recovers. Presidential nominee Joe Biden has made it very clear he will likely hike taxes, which could potentially cut 10 percentage points off earnings growth next year if implemented. If Biden wins, we would expect Chinese tariffs to be removed as well, which would offset some of that impact and according to our friends at Strategas Research Partners would suggest earnings growth of nearly 17%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.18.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in our LPL Chart of the Day, how the US dollar does ahead of the election has been a great indicator of which party might win in November. If the dollar is weak three months before the election, this bodes well for the incumbent party, while the incumbent party tends to lose if the dollar is strong. This signal has been right 7 of the past 8 elections.

&gt; As we saw back in March, when trouble hits, the US dollar tends to do well, as investors flock to the safety of the world’s reserve currency. When things are calm, the dollar tends to weaken, which favors riskier assets. So far, the dollar is slightly lower, which would suggest a potential win for President Donald Trump.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.18.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Also, the size of the tax increase proposed by Joe Biden as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) would be one of the largest ever and rival President Lyndon B. Johnson’s (LBJ) tax increases in the late 1960s. Let’s remember though, if there’s a split Congress, the chances of the full tax plan being implemented is quite slim. Additionally, a weaker economy would also reduce the chances of a large tax hike.

&gt; # Seasonal Volatility Just Getting Started

&gt; The market's day-to-day volatility has picked up in September after experiencing more stable trading action during the summer months. This is not out of the ordinary. Historically, the most volatile time of the year for stocks has been between September and early November. You can see this in the chart below that shows the average absolute daily percentage change for each trading day of the year beginning on the first trading day of January through the last trading day of December. As shown, daily volatility is very consistent around the +/-0.70% level over the first eight months of the year, but then it starts to pick up beginning in September until it reaches a peak during the first week or two of November. From there, the holiday season takes over and daily volatility plummets right through the end of the year. As shown in the chart, unfortunately we've still got a ways to go to get to the top of the volatility mountain, so make sure you've got your climbing gear ready for the next six to eight weeks!

&gt; # Keeping Tabs On High Frequency Growth

&gt; The week ended September 11th showed a sharp decline in our index of weekly GDP versus the year before. As shown, our index can be quite volatile, but it does do a decent job tracking the general trajectory of GDP. Since peaking at an implied growth rate of +0.9% YoY on July 10th, our index has slid to -2% YoY, the lowest reading since mid-June.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091820-Weekly.png))**

&gt; Taking a look at another tracker of short-term economic growth, below we show Weekly Economic Index data updated by the New York Fed each week. After decelerating sequentially YoY for the week ended September 4th, the WEI reported sequential YoY growth slower once again in the week ended September 11th. We also show what each high frequency tracker implies about quarterly growth. As shown, our tracker has consistently implied a higher quarterly growth rate than the Weekly Economic Index, and official data for the last two quarters. That said, Q3 is tracking at least 20%, with upside to the high-20s as the US continues to rebound from COVID. This post was originally published in our post-market macro report -- The Closer -- last night.

&gt; # Sell(ing) Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur

&gt; As the High Holidays approach you may remember the old saying on the Street, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur.” It gets tossed around every autumn when the “high holidays” are on the minds of traders as many of their Jewish colleagues take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.

&gt; The basis for this, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur,” pattern is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Even in the age of algorithmic, computer, and high frequency trading these seasonal patterns persist as humans still need to turn the machines on and off and feed them money or take it away – and these algorithms and trading programs are written by people so the human influence is still there.

&gt; Holiday seasonality around official market holidays is something we pay close attention to (page 100 Stock Trader’s Almanac). Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here. We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It’s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and sometimes opportune months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/08c1da4f106eb00e65a4532c55dd8ea0/ad7e0851da5530c5-bd/s1280x1920/744427ad7335745d917da73a6033df7c6d4fe9eb.jpg))**

&gt; Perhaps it’s Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 59% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 6.7%.

&gt; This year the high holidays commence on Friday eve, September 18, and end Monday September 28 with Yom Kippur just before Octoberphobia. The current news flow already has folks selling ahead of the Jewish High Holidays, quite possibly setting up the market for further declines.

*****

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 down 24 of 30 during week after September options expiration, average loss 0.95%

&gt; The week after September options expiration week, next week, has a dreadful history of declines most notably since 1990. The week after September options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 30 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just four times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.

&gt; Full stats are in the following sea-of-red table. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA –1.01%, S&amp;P 500 –0.95%, NASDAQ –0.95% and a sizable –1.42% for Russell 2000. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer holdings and position for the fourth quarter.

stocks,Some interesting news in the stock market this week,"**Radiant Logistics** was up 20% after hours on Monday after Q4 prelim revenues jumped 35% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.18 beats by $0.16. Radiant is a small player in North American freight compared to companies like C.H. Robinson, XPO, and Landstar, but it’s still large enough to generate scale benefits to lower client costs and simplify the shipping process.

Third party logistics was growing by about 7% p.a. before the pandemic but has received a boost from the shift to online purchases and $RLGT’s sales are also getting a boost from the time-tested strategy of adding operating scale through M&amp;A.  Despite this, $RLGT’s stock is flat on the year. At 33% of revenues compared to $XPO 50%, $CHRW 100% and $LSTR 100% it looks good value.

&amp;#x200B;

Also on Monday **Guess** CEO Alberini bought $1 million of stock in what looks like a big vote of confidence in a stock that is still available at a notable discount.  It wasn't too long ago that Guess was struggling with relevancy as sales declined. However, the company reversed its sales decline by expanding its business in Europe and Asia, building out its digital and omnichannel capabilities, and tightening its brand positioning and image.

Prior to the pandemic, Guess was growing revenue at a healthy rate. Guess didn't issue detailed guidance when it reported earnings on September 2nd, but said that based on current trends it expects revenues for Q3 and Q4 of FY21 to decrease, modestly, in the mid-teens range compared to a 43% drop in Q2.

That's a strong sequential improvement and with the stock still down 40% from February on a forward PE of 10 and zero (net) debt, the sizeable purchase by the Chairman yesterday looks like a big vote of confidence in a stock that is still available at a notable discount.

&amp;#x200B;

**Axogen** stock jumped 30% after hours on Tuesday after it said it expects sales to beat expectations by 30%. The $525 million valuation after the jump still looks cheap at 4x annualized sales and just a fraction of the company’s estimated total addressable market of $2.5 billion. $AXGN, the leader in surgical solutions for damage to peripheral nerves, says it now expects Q3 revenue to be ""at least"" $30M, above the market estimate of $23.04M.

&amp;#x200B;

On Wednesday **FedEx** stock jumped after Q1 results as Bank of America boosted its price target to $300 from $250 with analyst Ken Hoexter saying ""These results bring a $15-$16/sh EPS outlook for this year into discussion, from a floor of $9 last year, and will have investors looking forward to when $20 will be back in range,"" adding ""We believe the company is well positioned for a multi-year run of strong earnings growth,"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Also on Wednesday shares of **Magnite** $MGNI were up about 10% after a sharp sell-off of the ad tech company's stock in recent weeks that may have left shares oversold. Magnite became the world's largest programmatic advertising company on the sell-side of the ad-tech market (the opposite side as The Trade Desk) after a merger of CTV-focused Telaria and scaled programmatic player Rubicon Project earlier this year.  But you can still buy Magnite stock for less than 3.5x revenues whereas TTD will cost you a multiple of closer to 30x.

&amp;#x200B;

On Thursday **The Michaels Companies** $MIK made an interesting announcement saying it will hold a virtual investor day on Thursday to discuss the Company’s longer-term strategy adding “Through extensive research, Michaels has identified a sizable market opportunity, which presents the Company with a new phase of growth opportunity in the coming years as Michaels increasingly connects Makers, Content, Commerce, and Community.”

&amp;#x200B;

On Friday, JPMorgan lifted its price target on **Dollar General** to $250 from $230 saying ""Long term, CFO Garratt views DG as ‘really well-positioned’ relative to historic +2-4% comp algorithm (or potentially higher), given a laundry list of initiatives, tried-and-true new customer playbook to drive stickiness post-pandemic, and a model well suited for the broader value oriented/ trade-down consumer backdrop.""

Dollar General is attracting higher-income consumers, and these shoppers represent the company’s fastest-growing customer set, according to CEO Vasos. The company is also attracting people who Vasos described as more digitally savvy. 

“We are really pleased with our positioning right now and where we sit, as we move through COVID. But even prior to COVID, when you start to think about who our core consumer is, and then also those consumers that we've seen trade down into the brand, even before COVID. Our fastest growing segment by our percentage basis was really a higher income consumer,” said Vasos. The expansion of DG Fresh has also boosted margins which CFO John Garratt has said will continue to improve with scale.

personalfinance,Small Auto Loan without a Major Lender?,"I'm no stranger to auto financing but I have a quick question regarding the best means for getting a small car loan on an older, higher-mileage vehicle. 

I'm helping a close family member through the whole car shopping process but I've sort of hit a wall when it comes to financing. The dealer who's selling the car we're interested in doesn't work with any major lenders so it's just sub-prime lenders and credit unions they typically deal with. However, the buyer has okay credit (around 660 overall) and is putting down a down payment large enough to pay off nearly half the vehicle cost. Now, it's a 2009 model year with around 125k miles so large, reputable banks are not likely going to work with him. He's personally been advised to use Randolph Brooks Federal Credit Union since we live in Texas but credit unions don't seem very reliable (not that I have any experience however).

At around $10,000, the buyer could also just pay cash and skip the lenders but it doesn't seem wise as he'll be exhausting a small cushion of savings that he'll likely need in the near future if he becomes furloughed and seeks another full-time job or simply gets his hours reduced. His debt-to-income ratio isn't great either and we're hoping the substantial down payment, short loan term, and the relatively small dollar amount financed will help him qualify from a decent lender. What would be the best move to make here? Big banks, small banks, credit unions? Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you!

personalfinance,"Advice Needed: Is 401K Withdrawal to pay down debt, loan a good idea while unemployed? Gotcha's?","Hi, all - 

I became unemployed in May due to COVID-19, and have not yet been offered new work in my preferred career field. I have a 401k plan at WF that my employers' plan continues to manage, with various small fees/transaction. I believe the balance has to be at least $50k for this arrangement to continue, and my current balance is $117k.

I have two credit cards with moderately awful interest rates (my opinion) and combined debt of $20k, plus an auto loan with about $14k remaining. The auto loan (through WF, too) has been deferred for up to 6 months, through October's payment, though interest continues to accrue.

Given this context, it seems to make sense to take the hit on the 401k and pay off/pay down the debts, since my only income at present is unemployment. Am I thinking clearly? What do I need to watch out for, i's to dot and t's to cross, in order to not get bit hard on the backside?",finance
personalfinance,Am I ready to buy a house?,"I've encountered an unexpected sum of cash and I'm really wanting to use it to buy a house but I have very little education in matters like this. I would like to first know if the idea of buying a home with my current financial situation is foolish or not. If the idea of buying a home is sound, I would appreciate helpful links so I can start doing my homework.

I have 29k in student loan debt. My highest interest rate is 4.6% I have 8k in savings. Most of that is earmarked for a heavy down payment on a 'new' car. (I'm thinking 2017 honda fit). My credit is 722ish and I only use it just enough to grow my credit score.

I'm about to receive 20k.

I was hoping to buy a small home in the metro (Minneapolis/St Paul) Max cost of $200k. 1bed\bath around 750-800 square ft.
10k down, closing costs and throw the rest into the house 'savings' for expected and unexpected repairs. (I really want a house. It would be so nice to clean my own gutters and have a garden and paint the walls whatever color I want and cook all the garlic and onion I please.)

I did recently (2 months) change careers and I'm working an entry level position at a medical manufacturing company with really sexy benefits. I'm currently making $19 doing 50 hours a week. My goal is to be at 22/24 within two years. At the moment I save around $400 to 700 a month.

Right now I'm renting a room for $450 a month but the relationship has ended and I need to move out. Any *reasonable* apartment in the area is 1200 a month. I am reluctant to rent a room again because I'm 37 and it's weird and the pandemic scares me to the core. As for savings for retirement. There isn't any (2k in a lost 401k). My idea is to get a home and hunker down and save money while getting fat and playing video games. Then get a dog and lose weight when the pandemic is over and get a new romantic partner that also likes to horde pennies.

cybersecurity,Questions about marijuana and job clearance,"So to make this short and sweet. I usually smoke marijuana but not in an addictive way. I recently came back from my spring break trip back in March and that was one of the last times I kind of smoked. I did it a couple times in the past couple months. I already got my associates in IT and am working on my SEC +. I’m definitely going to stop a month before for the drug test but I’m worried if my past along with it would deny me a job. I’m 21 years old, I feel like everyone has tried it Atleast once during college or high school. I’m applying for entry level jobs with little or no clearance needed. It is entry level and I still have time before I even get a job. I don’t know if it’s going to be in a private company or federal, does that matter? Should I be worried about it?",technology
personalfinance,Should I consider a refinance if I'm planning to rent my house out?,"I received a call from quicken loans yesterday trying to get me to possibly refinance my home mortgage, to get a better interest rate. I hadn't considered it before, but after talking with the gentleman, it made me think whether or not this would be a good decision. 

My current situation:
-$87,000 left on the loan
-30-year fixed FHA (roughly 25 years left on the loan)
-3.75% interest rate
-$713 payment (taxes, MIP, and homeowners insurance included)


Refinance option:
-30 year fixed conventional loan
-2.99% interest rate
-$4700 closing cost (which would be added to the loan)
-$500 appraisal (only money out of pocket, but will be paid back by lender at closing)
-MIP eliminated
-$595 payment (taxes and HO insurance included)

I purchased my house (in Florida) for $98,000. Similar homes in my area have sold from $130, 000 to $160,000. I would guess a rental rate for this area would be around $1,100, and that's being somewhat conservative.

My wife and I aren't in the state to rent out right now, but we want to plan smart for the future. So I wasn't sure if I should take this advantage and get that interest rate while I still can, or if it would be best to just wait until we are ready to rent out the property. It seems like one of the biggest parks would be getting out of an FHA loan and getting into a conventional loan, plus being able to have the additional net from rent to help cover for any repairs/maintenance if needed. The house was built in 1955, so I'm sure problems will arise at some point.

Let me know your thoughts! Thanks!",finance

investing,Is the current market pullback just a correction or are we headed toward SPY 300 and lower?,"Update: SPY is now down to 322. 

TA:
50 DMA - 333.97
200 DMA - 309.93
JPOW Wall - 300
March low - 218

I am not seeing any post discussing the current market pullback. We peaked at SPY 357 and now at 331.  We are approaching correction territory and we crossed the 50 day moving average. 

The way I see it, we could easily test the 200 day moving average around 309, then the 300 wall, and quite possibly March lows. 

Edit: reasons I believe market is heading lower:

1. PE ratio is off the wall. I think it will come back down to long term value of around 15:1

2. With a lot more retail investors trading during this pandemic, I think it’s likely that investors who recently FOMO’d in the market will probably FOMO out on the decline, accelerating it.  

3. With a K-shaped economic recovery,I don’t think the stock market can continue to thrive even after vaccines are deployed. We will still have a dual economy, those continuing to thrive in remote office WFH environments(eg: software developers and other white collar jobs) and those who will still continue to struggle in retail/services industry. 

4. Uncertainty surrounding if covid will mutate and be an annual reoccurrence similar to the flu. Will wearing masks just be the norm going forward? Will we have to continue to leave the middle seats open on airplanes, or have restaurants at lower capacities? These are both industries with thin margins already. 

5. General feeling of complacency toward the coronavirus. Everyone is sick of reading about it on the news. You can see on Google trends. People are lowering their guards and treating it like any other flu. This will continue to add to the number of infections as we approach 7 million in the US and it slows down our recovery. 

6. University and college reopening still continue to struggle to reopen. Sure there is remote learning options, but there are still a lot of courses that need to be hands on and in person. 

7. Our national debt now almost $27 trillion. 

8. Feds were quick to deploy the first economic stimulus, but dragging their feet for this second stimulus. 

9. Probably last on my list, but I missed the boat to invest in March/April. Just wishful thinking that markets can pull back more.

personalfinance,But used car cash or finance a newer car,"I found a lot of post results in this sub regarding this subject, but none that are similar to my particular situation, so I thought I’d just post my own inquiry. 

Sold my truck about 6 months ago when wife and I started working from home due to Covid (monthly payments were insane and I sold it for more than I owe) and now wife and I share our paid off 2013 Civic which is in tip top shape (I bought this brand new in 2013).

Although we both work from home (mind you, my wife still has to go to her office twice a week) I just started doing real estate part time about 3 months ago. Luckily, we haven’t had to use our car at the same time, but I am starting to get busier in real estate and I fear I’m going to need the car for a house showing/ client meeting on the spot and she’ll be at her office or something and I’ll have no vehicle. I guess another vehicle is not an absolute “need” as of right now, but I feel it will be in the very near future as I’m starting to get busier spontaneously. 

I have $5k saved up and found 2 good used 2007 Honda Accords for that amount. One of the Accords has 150k miles and a clean Carfax, the other Accord is a 5spd (which I know how to drive, I just prefer the convenience of an automatic) has 109k miles and owner has all service records but no Carfax. Both in great shape, very clean and accident free/clean titles. 

I also found a nice 2015 Honda Accord with 60k miles for $14k. I talked with my credit union and if I were to finance the car for the full amount for 60 months at a 2.99% interest rate, my monthly payment would roughly be $270. 48 months at 2.74% would be roughly $330/month. 

I can swing the monthly payment comfortably and I like the idea of having a newer car that will give me greater peace of mind, but I’d hate to have another monthly bill and I absolutely hate interest. At the same time, I don’t want to deplete my savings, but the used Accords I found seem very dependable and I feel I could get at least another 5 years with either of them.

I will tell you I’m leaning toward buying a used car and then rebuilding my savings immediately after that, but if you were in my position, what would you do?",finance

I don’t think the sentence above is correct but the idea is this rate is more of an indicator for deposit &amp;amp; loan interest rate from bank. Thus, in reality, bank is still giving customer a positive interest rate.

Say, this zero rate environment makes bank gives customer a 1% deposit rate instead of usual say 4%, wouldn’t that mean bank deposit rate will be equal to investing in a PE 100 (instead of 25) company assuming 0 growth?",finance
personalfinance,Does it make sense to pay off a 2.45% car loan?,"I've got a 60 month car loan at 2.45% with 27 months ($507.17/mo) remaining.

personalfinance,Estimated Tax Payment and Doing the Math,"Hey all,

TLDR: I'll likely be cashing out a $20k profit in stocks in November or December, and am guessing that I need to make an estimated tax payment. Want to make sure I have the math right.

&amp;#x200B;

I considered my overall income (minus deductions like 401k, HSA and pre-tax benefits). This includes another $20k or so for any profits from stock. According to the federal tax brackets, I should owe.. let's call it x.

I believe I understand that I need to ensure I've paid 90% of what I'll eventually owe by the time I file. I won't reach 100% of what I paid last year to avoid underpayment penalty because I made a greater salary last year.

I estimated how much is witheld from my paycheck for federal taxes. Let's call it y.

Before my $20k in profits from stocks.. y =\~ .90x. So this means I should be fine from underpayment penalties \*if I didn't have an additional $20k profit\* coming. Therefore...

I'm in the 24% tax bracket. Should I just consider making an estimated tax payment of about $4.8k or wait until I cash out in December and calculate a more exact amount? $4.8k seems pretty high, but I guess that's just taxes for you.

Also, I'm unsure of the logistics of making an estimated tax payment. I'm guessing I make the payment here: [https://www.irs.gov/payments](https://www.irs.gov/payments) .. will this give me a form for tax filing? What kind of form would it be?

Thanks for any help",finance

I’m somewhat heavy into growth stocks but I always hear that inflation erodes the value of their future earnings and increased borrowing costs slow down growth.

personalfinance,Help me help my brother to begin investing on his own,"Edit:

Thanks to everyone for their thoughtful replies! I think I'll steer him toward a Traditional IRA. And I clearly need to sit down with him and pour over his 401(k) plan.

\* \* \* 

My brother is 50 years old and is a United States citizen. Due to COVID-related fiscal hardship, his employer has temporarily (?) frozen both employee contributions and matching to their 401(k) plan. He doesn't have much in the account (about $4,000), and what he has is invested in a target-date fund with a rather high expense ration, in my opinion.

I've just about convinced him to at least open an IRA and contribute to that on an after-tax basis, constructing a simple portfolio composed of a total US stock index fund and a total US bond fund. The question is now:  Traditional or Roth IRA?

His income is fairly low (total effective tax rate of 16.5% federal+FICA+state combined), so he should be able to fully deduct contributions to a Traditional IRA if he went that route.

However, he's asked whether he should rollover his 401(k) into this IRA as well. I'm in favor of him getting his money out of there and into something with better investment options. I can see a few different scenarios here (but please chime in if you can think of others!)

1. Open a Traditional IRA with aftertax contributions. Roll over the 401(k) money into the Traditional IRA as well.
2. Open a Roth IRA with (obviously) aftertax contributions. Open a Traditional IRA and roll over the 401(k) into it.
3. Open a Roth IRA. Roll over the 401(k) into a Roth IRA (probably need to use a Traditional IRA as an intermediate step here). Pay the tax hit on the rollover and go from there.

Cons:

Option 1:  It means mixing pretax and aftertax monies in the same account and the resulting headache over basis, etc. I don't want to make this too complicated for him, because he's already very gun-shy about investing.

Option 2:  He'd have two IRAs to keep tabs on.

Option 3:  He pays tax now rather than later on the money from the 401(k).

With his low income and the dearth of other employment opportunities in his area, I don't think my brother is going to retire at a higher salary. It'll be Social Security for him. He has injuries from a previous accident and I think it likely that he'll eventually have to go on disability.

Any thoughts? I want to give him the best advice that I can for his situation.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on how a car's Negative Equity goes down?,"Without getting into the whole story of how I let myself get into such a situation, (I've learned my lesson) I'm hoping to work toward being able to sell my financed car through initially dedicating a chunk of time saving up the money needed to pay off just the negative equity portion, which is almost 13k.

My question is, while I'm having trouble locating what my less-than-ideal interest rate on the car loan was, is there still a way to tell whether the negative equity portion slowly starts decreasing on it's own through the regularly set car payments alone (assuming I drive it below the average yearly mileage estimates per year and keep it in great condition), OR does the car's pay-off amount decrease with payments, but the negative equity portion of that stays about the same due to regular depreciation of the car's value? (I'm talking within the course of about one year, before factoring in the money I'm saving up in that one-year time frame to contribute to paying off the negative equity. It's a 2019 car.)

personalfinance,What to do with Bonus Money?,"Hi All,

Throw away account.

I am in the process of beginning to think about house buying with significant other (I know not to have us both of our names on it. But, with that being said, we’re also beginning to look at engagement rings etc. so by the time we buy could be fiancé/wife). Not in a rush to buy, currently have an 18 month lease, but hard to ignore current interest rates on home loans. 

Trying to figure out the smartest thing to do with quarterly bonuses, which have a potential of $7500 each and Q4 bonus can exceed that, significantly, based on full year performance. Base income each year is $65k, usually make about $85-100k. 

HCL area, so we’ve been looking at $350-450k houses. Between both of our incomes, and the $2400 we already spend each month on rent, the mortgages we’ve played with online seem doable. But, will obviously learn more when trying to be approved, see what we are approved for, etc. preference is to stay on the lower end of that range as is. 

I currently have:
-	$16k in a Savings account. 
-	$9.9k in a car loan that is at 3.2% with monthly payments of $234. I’ve already $5.6k off in the past 2 months, and have been looking to pay it off ASAP. Q2 bonus I threw $4k at the loan. 
-	$6.2k in student loans at 4.3% that I haven’t touched since student loan payments were frozen. But monthly was/is $50, and I throw extra money at it every now and then. Have paid off $20k in student loans in past 3 years. 
-	770+ credit score

Ignoring monthly budget and focusing strictly on allocation of quarterly bonuses, would it be better to throw extra money at the 2 loans or throw towards savings toward a down payment?

personalfinance,Tips for building credit/picking first credit card and consolidating/refinancing student loans? (20s),"Hi! I’m looking to get my first credit card and build my credit, and possibly refinance my student loans after graduation. Any suggestions for a first credit card? Here’s my financial outlook:

- 40k/year salary with good benefits (partial tuition reimbursement, 401k with 5% match and Roth option invested, health &amp; dental insurance, free public transportation, pension, paid cell phone)
- Currently finishing school with student loan debt totaling ~$25,000 by graduation
- Rent: $900/month, adding utilities $975-$1000/month
- Student loan payment: $177/month currently
- Personal loan through credit union to help build credit: $85/month, making payments to cover $1,000 over 12 months
- No car or other monthly payments
- Generally good about regularly cooking food/saving money by limiting extra spending

Here’s where I am having some difficulty: About 7 years ago I had to leave my first university due to health issues (eventually went back to different school) and had to start making payments towards a student loan, which I couldn’t afford at the time, so there are 7-9 months of delinquent marks on my credit report (confirmed with free reports from AnnualCreditReport.com). Those appear to be the only negative marks on my reports, but the lack of new accounts seems to be hurting me too. I’ve applied for a few credit cards but have gotten denied 4/5 times because of my Fair credit rating, so I’m kind of in this loop of bad credit/can’t improve credit because I’m not getting approved.

For my student loans, a large chunk of it is with a private lender, and about 25-30% are federal loans, which are in deferment right now because of my student status. I refinanced my private loan recently and am thinking of consolidating my student loan debt after I graduate. Also will likely be moving onto a higher paying job after graduation which I’m hoping will allow me to make bigger monthly payments towards student loans.

My savings are OK, not great, but I do have emergency savings and some smaller investments that I do not plan to touch unless absolutely necessary/further down in life perhaps. So with the primary goals of building credit and reducing financial and mental stress surrounding student loans, I’m hoping to get my financial situation organized now to make bigger purchases (car/house etc) easier down the line.

personalfinance,What Type of Loan Should We Get to Pay Back a Parent for Buying Us a House?,"My wife and I had the opportunity to buy a foreclosed home in excellent shape.  They did a silent auction and we had the highest bid.  We were pre-approved for a mortgage and even had the 20% down payment to avoid PMI.  However, the realtor told us that because banks were backed up with so many mortgage applications she recommended we buy with cash if at all possible (a client of hers recently had a foreclosure deal fall through as the loan process took too long even though they had ideal credit).

My father had passed away and left my mother with enough money from his life insurance policy that my mom was willing to transfer a portion of it to a joint bank account we shared and let me buy the house with the money with the understanding I would pay her back.  This way the house is listed in my name and my wife’s names - we are the official owners.

We closed on the house and spent a lot of money out of our own pockets remodeling the inside of it.  Now that the interior remodel is done we want to get a loan to pay my mom back.  I did lots of research on mortgages but don’t know much about what I need to do in this situation.  Additionally, we want to get some extra money in the loan to remodel the exterior of the house.  We know we need to get an appraisal done before the loan can happen.  The good news is that a loan to pay my mom back and remodel the deck is probably just around 50%-75% of what the appraisal value should be.

I spoke with People’s Bank and they recommend a home equity line of credit.  They are doing zero closing costs and offering free appraisals.  This seems like a good deal but I need a better understanding of the nuances of these loans.  I know I would prefer something that has a fixed interest rate, and I want something I can pay off the principal early and not get charged the extra interest.  I am comfortable with 15 or 30 year loan but may go with the 30 if I think putting extra money in a ROTH IRA would save me more money in the long run if the interest rate on the 30 year loan is lower.  

Do you recommend I get a home equity line of credit or something else?  What advice would you recommend?  Thanks in advance!",finance

investing,Are inflation-linked bonds the way forward for fixed income investing?,"**We have been in bull bond market for almost 4 decades with over time interest rates cuts.**

**We have probably just bottomed and there is not that much cutting that we can do from here, so the only way for interest rates is up in the long term. Surely they will keep them low for some years to get the economy back on track, but eventually they will go up (so one has to be prepared when that happens some time in the future)**

*As some of you may know, when interest rates rise, that means that holding bonds (in particular I am talking about government bonds ETFs) won't be profitable: in a rising rates enviroment you gain because the coupon rise but you lose because the bonds that you already hold devalue, and the result is a nominal zero.* [*I read this interesting article*](https://betterbuyandhold.com/bond-etfs-in-an-era-of-rising-rates/) *that simulated holding the TLT, IEF and SHY ETFs (funds that hold  and roll US treasuries of various maturities respectively) in a constantly rising rate world, just like the 70s, and the model pretty much says that it's gonna be flat for the a decade form the point where interest rates start to rise onwards.*

*Furthermore,* [*as outlined in this interesting article*](https://www.lynalden.com/fiscal-and-monetary-policy/)*, if there is an actual full scale depression with bankruptcies and these high levels of debt, it likely that governments will find a way to significantly devalue cash and bonds to alleviate the weight of debt. The last time a depression took place in the 1930s-1940s, governments capped the interest rate below the inflation rate, screwing bond holders and effectively transfering real wealth from creditors to debtors.*

**This creates a problem: where will you allocate the portion of your portfolio that you need to be less volatile to hegde against the volatilty of equities (the portion that before you were investing in bonds? You can't just yolo everything on stocks and gold betting on this.**

**I thought about inflation-linked treasuries: for those who don't know them, they work by tying the payout and the coupon to a national consumer prices index. Many of these bonds even end up in popular ETFs that hold them. Obviously you make money if there is inflation and you lose some if there is deflation.**

My concern is that I never used these instruments, and I know little about them, so I wanted to know your opinion on them: Are they actually a good substitute for normal treasuries? How do they compare in terms of performance? Do you think they could be a good investment for the next decades? What are some additional risks? Are default risks the same?

Can the goverments/inflation find a way to screw not only the ones who hold normal bonds, but also the oens who hold these special types of bonds?",finance
Bitcoin,Reasons to buy Bitcoin,"What are all of the reasons you bought Bitcoin? 

Here's my list: 

1. Innovation - Bitcoin is an entirely new form of wealth. Bitcoin is the most valuable digital creation ever, and it's just getting started. Bitcoin is unstoppable because of its nature. Bitcoin can't be copied. 

2. Monetary policy - I don't even know how to say this correctly, but... I love the issuance schedule of Bitcoin. There's a block every ten minutes. Every block includes a bribe to the miners to spend electricity. That's called a block reward. It started at 50 BTC. Then every 210,000 blocks (about 4 years) the reward gets cut in half. This happens 33 times total until all 21,000,000 BTC are mined in about the year 2140, at which point the network continues on working forever existing on transaction fees alone. 

The monetary policy creates a 4 year exponential price cycle. The stock to flow theory explains this more elegantly. Gold is valuable because you can't copy it, it's rare, and not much new gold is mined/found each year. It would take 62 years of the current mining rate to mine as much gold as we have today. But Bitcoin is different. It is impossible to mine/create as much Bitcoin as what already exists today. 

Block 649258 was just mined. That means there exists 18,495,362.5 BTC. There's only 2,504,637.5 BTC left to mine ever. Bitcoin is already more rare than gold. 

How much longer do you think it's going to take before people catch on and the price goes up because of the network effect? 

18,495,362.5 BTC divided evenly across the planet would be less than 0.0025 BTC per person. 

Reason #3: Bitcoin has been battle hardened. Bitcoin is unhackable at the network level. So if you use Bitcoin at the network level with a non custodial Bitcoin wallet, then you're pretty solid. Probably safer than all the good in your Fort Knox. 

So what are your reasons for buying Bitcoin?",cryptocurrency

My wife and I have talked about staying with her mom until our son starts school and potentially beyond since the house is in a great location for my work and schools. Plus the longer we stay here the more we support her mother's retirement / financial security... But now I'm wondering what is the smartest financial investments for my wife, son, and I (hard to be objective with this).

&amp;#x200B;

Originally I was just thinking of going into mostly VTSAX and then some other investments keeping about 45k in emergency savings then if an opportune house buying time/situation happened pulling from investments to make that happen. But now I see a comfortable 20% down payment (thinking about a 160k down payment) and a chance to get on the property ladder staring at me and wondering if I should make the leap while interest rates are low. But what about the home life we want? We still would like help with our son and driving to Grandma's 4x a day sounds bad (especially depending on location), plus I don't want to leave my MIL high and dry and needing to find renters in a time like this.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a creative thought of maybe buying something now and renting it out just to get in on some real estate and hopefully get my mortgage paid for (I don't really have any interest in managing multiple rental properties, just would need someone to keep it warm till we are ready to move in).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also trying to think through the potential risks or stock market drop, house pricing drop, interest rate increases, retirement planning, etc... I could really use some outside perspective/help.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Should we?

A. Stay with MIL and put extra money into retirement accounts/investments (and potentially buy a house at better time).

B. Stay with MIL and buy a house now and rent it out.

C. Buy a house now and move in, then try to help MIL get new renter.

D. Stay with MIL FOR-EV-ER 😅",finance
personalfinance,I'm a federal employee with 10% 401(k) match on 6% contribution and pension. Is contributing to an IRA overkill?,"Hey guys,

So I've thought about it and am leaning towards it is overkill, but wanted another opinion.  The setup at my agency is we have access to the federal Thrift Savings Plan, which is virtually the same as a 401(k), and a separate agency 401(k).  Taken together, we basically get a 10% employer match on a 6% self-contribution. The agency also contributes an additional $1,000 every December to the 401(k) plan which adds another 1-2% to that employer contribution.  From my understanding, an amount equal to 17-18% of my annual salary is being saved for retirement right now. This is all without even considering the federal pension payments I would receive.

Am I right to think further retirement contributions to an IRA would be overkill? I feel like I'd be better off just using would-be IRA money to improve my quality of life in the present day, but I'm not sure if I ought to count employer matching in my savings rate or whether it's wise to expect the pension to be around by retirement.

It came with an HDMI cable but I bought a DP since I’m using an NVIDIA Card and the monitor’s an AMD Freesync. 

So I played with it very minimal and used for classes. 144hz at 1080p. 

Suddenly, after I registered it at MSI’s website for 36months warranty, few seconds after, the screen went gray but the unit is still on. The monitor has power but no display 

I on and offed the unit many times. The MSI logo doesn’t show on monitor at bootup like it used to. But the monitor has power, the light indicator is on. 

I tried another old monitor to my system unit, attached it to the motherboard since it only has vga.

personalfinance,How can we set up short term family loan to avoid tax issues?,"Wife and I are building a home and in my laws will be loaning us $100-120K, which we will pay back at end of construction within 3 months at same time we close our new mortgage.  Inlaws know that we'll be paying them back no matter what, no trust issues.  They actually don't want us to pay any interest but want to make sure they don't get screwed come tax time so that's why I am trying to figure this out. 

For reference here is the IRS interest minimum: [IRS Applicable Federal Rate](https://apps.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/federalRates.html) I see short term adjusted AFR is 0.11%

1) My understanding is we just need to draw up a family loan agreement with set payment schedule and interest charges then track the payments (checks), then Inlaws will claim the small amount of interest earnings on their tax return? 

2) According to my IRS link, if we want to pay monthly interest do I just divide take total loan amount x .11% (short-term adjusted AFR for October) then divide by 12 to get our monthly interest payment? 

3) Can remaining interest payments be waived after full payment of loan, assuming I write this into loan agreement?

personalfinance,Managing debt and credit,"Hi all, 

As of today I have ~20k in federal student loans (broken down into 5 separate loans (2.1k, 2.2k, 2.4k, 3.5k, 4.5k, 5.5k). As you may know they aren’t accruing interest basically until next year. When accruing interest they all have rates around 4-5%. The total outstanding interest from unsub loans is $500. 

The actual payment plan now would be to pay 300 a month for ten years, but there is no point in carrying debt for that long. 

After my expenses are said and done I have an extra 2k/month that I could potentially throw at my loans. Right now I have 12k saved up. My monthly expenses currently add up to ~1k. My current job is also quite stable. Worst comes to it my lease is flexible and I can move back home so I have quite a bit of risk tolerance. 

Should I wait to start paying them next year once they are out of forbearance? Or should I just start throwing money at them now? 

Also, should I pay them off ASAP, and not worry about the impact it will have on my credit score (lowering age and lowering number of accounts)? Right now I just have one secured credit card that I’m keeping on top of things with (secured since it’s my first card and I had to clear up some identity theft issues (collections) (which I’ve since cleaned up)).

gaming,Will the Xbox Series S become obsolete faster then PS5 and Xbox Series X? Will it hold back Developers in making ambitious games for all systems?,"I've been talking recently with a few people both IRL and here on reddit and we cant seem to come to a solid consensus on what the reality of the Series S is going to look like. Personally I think from Microsofts view it's going to be two things, a stepping stone for gamers with less disposable income until they can afford a Series X and a dedicated Xbox Game Pass machine. Now there's nothing wrong with those two things on the surface but I personally think it will create problems down the line. I have always been a Playstation guy and am naturally going with the PS5 this generation, but with that said I've always liked Xbox and have bought their consoles in the past. I've always thought the whole of console wars is a stupid  useless thing only annoying fanboys who want to justify their brand of choice take part in. Don't get me wrong there is no shame in having a friendly, if not semi-heated debate/conversation about which brand has the best features and games. Also I love the competition between Sony and Microsoft (Nintendo just does their own thing) cause it only makes things better for the comsumer.

I've been looking into and reading online what having a lower spec console that is in the same generation as higher spec consoles might cause in the coming years. And have heard tech people both say that it is going to effect how developers make their games but others say that it won't affect game development at all. The Series S having less RAM and a slower SSD then the Series X (and much slower SSD then the PS5) from my understanding will hinder development of 1st, 2nd and 3rd party devolpers when developing games that need to run on all if not only xbox's consoles. I dont think we will see much of difference in quality in the beginning between Series S and its beefed up big brothers. I do think in 3-4 years though the console could if not become obsolete then will force developers to give up trying to really get the most out of the Series S and PS5. Our current generation once they have gotten used to both consoles architecture, developers have done incredible things with the Xbox One and PS4. I just think if game manufacturers are forces to make games for all consoles including the Series S the game on it will be somewhat inferior to the Series X and PS5. Sony's Jim Ryan is quoted as saying while they looked into doing something similar to the Series S their research showed that the results are never that great. Also that consoles/PCs like it are usually obsolete much faster then the higher spec devices that it is competing with. I know he's part of the Series S direct competition but I think the point still stands.

I am truly curious what others think of tbus predicament we find ourselves in. Like I said at the beginning of this post I have no hate of Microsoft and truly do not wish to see them fail in anyway. I have just heard some conflicting takes on this and thought I'd put up a post to debate it. I knew not to ask this on Playstation or Xbox's subreddits since there would be an obvious bias so I hope this subreddit is a healthy place for it

Thank you if you took the time to read all of this and whatever console you choose I hope you have fun with it this holiday season.",technology

I wonder if, at some point, if you’re holding crypto and savings as part of a risk diversification strategy, then you also want to consider either taking out insurance on your savings — costly — or allocating some of it to something like Kraken, which would, as a Federal bank, include deposit insurances.

It's a point of failure, for sure, just like keeping money at an exchange but perhaps it's never going to be so straightforward. I'm thinking of the future, where sooner or later, we'll need to think of inheritance. What if we don't have kids. What if we don't have spouses or close friends. What if they're not into Bitcoin and don't want to be. We still want to make sure they get it after we pass on. And not get lost forever when private keys are buried with us.

We might then consider engaging such services for custodial services alongside inheritance plans — so when we die, for example, I can have some assurance that my will is carried out and a custodial entity, perhaps a bank like Kraken, would ensure my crypto is passed on properly.

So we are in Catch 22, unclear what to do. It seems ridiculous that when we tell Google Store about the fraud, they don't take any action and just tell us to contact FedEx. 

Would you have any advice for concrete action what to do here? Although the credit cards are not ours, we do not want to become liable if this is part of some strange fraud scheme, and also we want to help the person whose credit cards were used to know their credit cards were abused and to recover all the funds.",finance
personalfinance,Roth Max Out vs Student Debt Payment,"Hello, I’m looking at what looks like a common dilemma. 

-27 year old
-68k salary
-23k in federal student loans (4k at 6.8% interest, rest below 4%)
-5k short of max Roth contribution annually
-Aggressively saving for 20% down payment by next spring on a 300-350k home with my partner

My student loans are frozen at 0% until end of year. I’m currently contributing 15% to the Roth, but I will be short of maxing it out. I’m setting aside $500 per month into a high yield savings just to pay down my highest interest student loan. Would you max the Roth before attacking that student loan at 6.8% given that I’m not paying any interest until end of year? I’m budgeted out pretty much to the max with this upcoming house purchase.",finance

personalfinance,"Need advice: after closing on a refinance, the lender sent an updated borrower disclosure","On September 9th, I received a borrower disclosure from the lender, which I reviewed, signed, scanned, and sent well before the closing.

On September 18th, during closing, the settlement agency's notary presented the same disclosure, so I signed that as well, and the rest of the packet reflected those numbers.

After the closing, I received another borrower disclosure via FedEx, with a different cost to close.

Now I'm hearing that this newer one is the correct disclosure.

What should I do with this new disclosure? Can the lender be held to the terms of the old one?

Unfortunately, even the representative from the lender doesn't seem to know what happened.",finance
personalfinance,How will refinancing credit card debt with a personal loan impact my credit?,"Credit card debt is shitty, I know; so let me at least start out by saying I have an excellent credit score now (I always have, though it was more on the “good” side while we carried this debt until recently), and recently reduced that balance from $32k to $14k over the past 6-9 months or so. I’ve always made all my payments on time, and at least the minimum payment, and lately obviously much more than minimum, though I may not continuously be able to do so (but always at least the minimum, on time). 

So, things are looking up, and I’m looking to find a way out of the high interest rate of credit card debt, and since my credit score is strong I have been considering going the route of a personal loan. I’ve looked at some preapprovals, and all have a lower rate (pretty significantly) than my credit cards. 

What I’m wondering is: how would making that change affect my credit? other than the ding for the inquiry, are there other factors I should be considering?

Edit to add: I know getting out of debt is a huge priority; but we are also looking at refinancing student loans, thus the concern for the credit score.",finance

personalfinance,I have $50000 in savings. Should I invest or pay off my dad's mortgage?,"Hello,

Over the past year I have saved about $57000. I want to keep about $7000 to pay for my own expenses.

My dad has two mortgages, one for his store with $135000 remaining at an 8.5% interest rate, and the other for our home which he hasn't paid (but with a lower rate.) He's old and it's a big source of stress for him, and I want to pay him back in some way. I'm wondering if it would be better to pay off about $50000 of his mortgage, which would save us $4000 over a year in interest, or invest that into some ETF and hope for higher returns. I know the market is volatile nowadays, and I ideally would like to not lose my money, so I'm leaning on paying off my dad's mortgage and making him happy. Am I thinking about this correctly?",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing a loan?,"Background: About a year ago I took out a loan to consolidate some my credit card debt, it was a great move. My score jumped 100 points overnight, the monthly payments are way better than paying off each of my cards, I closed a small credit account to reign in my spending habits, and I’ve been taking chunks out of my other credit cards while using my primary credit card as a revolving door for utilities and unexpected expenses so I don’t nuke my bank account between pay periods. Once the dust settled and the utilities started reporting as they ebb and flow of course my score dropped some. Now, however, almost a year later I still have a net gain of almost 40 points from this move.

Currently: Today I was logging into credit karma like I do every week to see what’s happening in the credit world, and a notification pops up about my interest rate on my loan being 75% higher than other people with similar scores. (My EQ and Trans are both about 670, EX claims 690ish) so this piqued my interest. My current interest rate is something to the tune of 30%? I can’t be bothered to look it up right now because reasons. Which 30ish is fine, quite frankly, because I’ve been riding the minimum on the regular and then dropping additional payments from time to time to keep ahead of the curve. The remaining balance on the loan is about 8k, the initial loan was for 10k. When running through the “pre approval” steps, I listed 8k as the loan amount requested, one of the options that popped up has only a 17% interest rate, and a minimum about 1/3 lower than my current. Now- I’m not interested in this because I want to pay less monthly, actually I would keep my monthly payments the same so I could actually pay this refinance off “faster” than it’s contract term of 48 months, the lower interest rate is what catches my mind because it could save me a couple thousand dollars in interest over the same period of time as I am on track for to be paid off now.

The quandary: I’ve never refinanced anything. Does it look bad to refinance a loan after not even a year? What ramifications could this have on my credit score? Would refinancing a loan so soon cause any yellow or red flags a few years down the road when I’m trying to buy a house? I need the skinny on the dos and dont’s of this option, because right now all I see is the opportunity to cut my interest rate by 30~% and save money in the long run, and it’s like wearing blinders.",finance
Banking,Chase Bank - Certificate of Deposit,"Hey all,

I hope you are doing well! I have a Chase Bank 9-month CD that matures on 9/27/2020. I received a notice in the mail saying I had a 10-day grace period to terminate or renew the CD. I decided with interest rates being so low (going from 2% to .05%!), it was time to cash out. 

I spoke to the Chase customer service rep and asked if they could confirm that the 10-day grace period was before OR after the maturity date, and the rep said “it’s either before or after.” I asked a second time just to confirm and they gave the same answer. So I said they can close the CD, and put the money into my savings.

After the phone call I noticed I had a negative balance on my CD account indicating that I owed the bank funds for an early withdrawal fee. 

I called Chase a second time, and I was informed that I was provided with the “wrong information.” They escalated the issue to an ‘Escalation Team’ who stated they would review the incident and get back to me in a few days. I guess I could’ve done my own research regarding this matter, but I figured if I had any questions I could call Chase and get the correct answers. Do you think they’ll be able to credit my account for the fee?

If they can’t credit my account - should I be asking for any sort of compensation? I’ve been a Chase bank member for over 25-years, and I have a ton of products with them. Getting incorrect information definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth especially when I’m 6-days away from having a matured CD. 

Hoping to hear all of your thoughts. Thank you in advance!",finance

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

personalfinance,Advice on managing retirement / investment funds while living abroad (GER),"Hi all

I moved to Germany this summer (US citizen), and I am now trying to determine a good option for continuing my retirement savings and investments.  A bit of background first:  

I was working full-time in the US for the past three years after finishing my Bachelors and Masters (I'm 27 years old).  I had a Traditional 401(k) with my previous employer, who had a meager match, and I was making around a 8% contribution.  My funds are still in their plan, but I am considering rolling it over into an IRA since I am unable to make any post-tax contributions to it. I believe the fund is at around $25k - $30k right now.  I also have about $7k in an Emergency Fund, and had started investing money in stocks / mutual funds through Vanguard as just another means of saving / investing without tying it to retirement (about $4.5k).  My current, German employer does not offer any sort of retirement plan, so I'm assuming any retirement savings would have to go to a Roth IRA.  Currently making ~$60k USD.

I am currently unsure how long I will be working abroad, but the best estimate right now is approximately 3 - 5 years.  Doing some research on the subject, it appears I would most likely need to pursue the Federal Tax Credit instead of the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion to even be eligible to contribute to an IRA.  

My initial thought is to open an IRA with Vanguard since I have some investments with them and rollover my 401(k) into a Traditional IRA.  Then I will make contributions to a Roth IRA.  I had been questioning whether contributing to a mutual fund outside of an IRA was worthwhile or not, but now that I'd be limited to ~$6k in Roth IRA contributions per year, it seems like a good way to still be able to invest any additional money available.  Personally I had been treating it as a savings account for longer term goals (house / car down payment, etc.) with greater potential for growth, but maybe that's stupid.  I'd love any feedback or advice I could get, especially from those who have been in similar situations.

Thanks!

Edit: Also should have added that I have about $10k in private student loans to be paid off at a 4% rate.  Currently making $400 USD payments per month towards it.  So also would welcome any input on balancing the savings vs. debt payoff.",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on moving forward,"Hello everyone!

I could really use some advice and multiple opinions about how to move forward. To be honest, I'm severely mentally exhausted and just not sure if this would be the right move so multiple viewpoints are extremely appreciated.

I'm wondering if it is a good idea to pay off my car completely. I've been following the flowchart and steps to managing money from the PF Wiki, which I absolutely LOVE BTW. Long story short, my pregnant wife was laid off due to COVID because she couldn't come in to work due to being pregnant, so she qualified for the CARES Act. From the combination of unemployment and the CARES Act, we were able to save up over $10k for our savings account.

I currently make ~$50k/year, going off of last years because this year is so effed up and I haven't been able to determine it yet, or $1600 twice a month and My wife is still currently taking unemployment at $200 / week. 

Our bills are as follows:

Bill | Amount a month | Essential or Non
:--|:--:|--:
Rent | $785 | Essential
Student Loan-$30k | $211 | Essential
Car Loan-$6500 | $170 | Essential
Car/rent Insurance | $160 | Essential
Electric | $100 | Essential
Phone Bill | $90 | Essential
Life Insurance | $33 | Essential
Cox Internet | $59 | Essential
Groceries | $500 | Essential
Gas | $150 | Essential
Birth Medical Bill | $200 | Essential-Kinda
Disney Plus | $13 | Non-Essential
Cinemark Movie Club | $9 | Non-Essential
Spotify | $15 | Non-Essential

This does not include eating out or drinks or snacks and the like.

Would it be beneficial to go ahead and pay off my car to free up the $170? I know it would reduce  us below our 6 month emergency fund, which I don't think we are even really at yet, I think we still have another $2k to go. With all the stuff we need to buy for our newborn, we won't have much extra space in the way of putting some back to savings. I'm also in a position where I can' get a raise, due to economy, or change jobs, due to economy.

Should I pay off or hold out?

My car I owe $15k (worth about $19k) &amp; my condo I owe $54k on (worth about $135k &amp; plan to hold long term). From shopping rates it looks like I could get a 2.9-3.1% on car refi loan only bumping the term out 2 month (on month 58 of 72 would refi to a 60/mo) but it'd really only net me $10-12/mo not sure if thats even worth the hassle.

But with the roughly $5-6k in fees to refi I figure I should cash out as well, I could pull out some cash new loan could be in the $75k-100k range. If I did cash out, I could use the cash out balance just to pay off my car loan to ""save"" $240/mo but not sure if that's the best move.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Sept 21, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, September 21, 2020**

Stocks continued sinking Monday, with the three major indexes extending last week’s declines. The drop continued as traders became concerned with stagnating improvement in coronavirus cases and political uncertainty, with the US presidential election around 6 weeks out. The Dow fell the hardest today, finishing 1.84% down, the Nasdaq finished 0.39% up, and the SPY was 1.07% down.

Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research said, “The root causes of the recent drawdown in US large caps are \[first\], recent weakness in real-time economic indicators, \[second\] the lack of movement on a fiscal stimulus package that could offset #1 and \[third\] the Fed’s lackluster forecasts in its Wednesday release of the Summary of Economic Projections”.

Shares of major bank stocks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), HSBC (HSBC) and Deutsche Bank (DB) fell following a report that they and other financial institutions for decades facilitated fund transactions used for allegedly criminal activities, and failed to report suspicious activity. The report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found five global banks moved ""staggering sums of illicit cash for shadowy characters and criminal networks that have spread chaos and undermined democracy around the world."" The report cited documents leaked by BuzzFeed News that identified more than $2 trillion in transactions between 1999 and 2017 that were flagged by financial institutions’ internal compliance officers as possible money laundering or other criminal activity, including $514 billion at JPMorgan and $1.3 trillion at Deutsche Bank.

“Reopening stocks”, or stocks benefits when the economy looks like it will reopen soon amid the pandemic, fell steeply today, as fear over coronavirus cases here and abroad led to fear of more business closure. In the US, there are now, sadly, 200,000 deaths and new cases have risen in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, and North Dakota, per Yahoo Finance. WHO officials warned that the spread of coronavirus in Europe now is worse than it was in March, near the start of the pandemic and that a ‘very serious situation is unfolding in Europe”. Cruise stock Royal Caribbean Group (RCL) fell more than 7% in intraday trading, and airlines including United Airlines (UAL), Southwest (LUV) and Delta (DAL) were each down at least 6%.

**Highlights**

* After opening the day deep in the red, tech stocks like $AAPL, $AMZN, and $MSFT rallied in the last hour to end firmly green or modestly red.
* Tesla (TSLA)  will likely partner with a Canadian mining company, Giga Metals Corp. (OTCQB:HNCKF) to source Nickel. Company claims it can source it in an environmentally friendly way. Battery day is tomorrow, we expect big things!

personalfinance,"Mid-term savings (ie wedding, home) as a young adult/grad student","Hi all,

I am a 22 year old in the US, and I just started graduate school in August. I just moved across the country for grad school, began renting an apartment, and started earning an income, and I'm trying to figure out the best savings plan for myself going forward, and I would appreciate any advice you may have.

My graduate program thankfully provides me a stipend, and I should be taking home \~$29k/year after taxes for the next 5 years or so. I live in a pretty high COL area, but I am generally a frugal person, and I expect to be able to contribute \~$500/month to savings and/or investments. I currently have an online emergency savings account with $8k. My school does not provide a 401k option, so I have opened up a Schwab Roth IRA, and contributed $500 so far this year. I plan to stick to a 3-fund portfolio for my Roth. I also have \~$9k in a checking account, which I will be gradually moving to savings or investments - the only reason I'm taking my time with this is because I have a lot of one-time moving expenses that I am still taking care of. Finally, I have \~$500 in stocks within a Robinhood account that I opened in college - I do not intend to use this as my main investing strategy, rather a ""fun"" discretionary investment with a very small fraction of my overall savings.

I have enough in my savings account for a 6 month emergency fund. My stipend and position in the university is pretty secure for the next 5 years, so I'm not too worried about losing my income. I also have a solid health insurance plan, so I don't anticipate any crazy medical expenses. I will continue to live frugally, and I shouldn't have any huge expenses in the next few years. I do have $5.5k of student loan debt, and I plan to start repaying this as soon as the zero-interest period ends. While the government is freezing interest, I'd like to focus on other savings rather than paying off my loans.

My main question is, what is the best way to distribute my savings and investments going forward? I am thinking about mid-term savings goals - ie a wedding, car, and home. I have a 5 year old car that I hope will last me at least through grad school, and I don't anticipate getting married or buying property in the next 5 years. However, I'm in a long term relationship, and I can anticipate a wedding and related big life changes and expenses \~8 years (give or take) down the road. While I don't want a big expensive wedding (or a huge home), I know these expenses add up, and I want to start thinking about savings strategies sooner rather than later.

I have no idea how to save for such mid-term expenses - is this something I should save for in a savings account, or since it's several years in the future do I go with a lower-risk investment portfolio? I feel like it's pointless to just leave thousands of dollars sitting in a low-interest rate savings account for years, but I don't know if an investment of less than 10 years is too risky... So where do I throw my money for mid-term goals - investments or savings? If I should invest this money, what's the best type of investment for a non-tax-advantaged investment account?

Also, how much should I put towards these goals vs my long-term goals (ie retirement)? If I can save $500/month, this is just enough to max out my Roth IRA each year, leaving me little or no room for non-retirement savings. Do I put most of my money toward retirement and only a small fraction towards mid-term goals, or vice versa? I'm probably at least 35 years from retirement, so that's less pressing, but the allure of compound interest makes me want to contribute as much as possible. On the other hand, my big expenses are about 8 years (I think) away, so maybe I should make those a priority? How do I balance these conflicting interests? Are there other considerations I should take into account??

Thanks for reading this very long post. Any advice is greatly appreciated!!!",finance

Story
My wife was furloughed from her job in March, she has accepted a new position and we relocated several states away. Part of that is both of us took a Severance agreement and will have roughly 40k headed our way in 2-3 months. 

Our other house is under contract and set to sale end of next month, we will have 30k in cash headed our way once the house sales.  

We have picked a house out in our new location. We need 60k for 20% down and currently have total of 50k liquidity on hand. Because of temporary living arrangements in a small apartment and storage fee's of household belongings, closing on this new house ASAP is a high priority to us. 

Because we are switching jobs, 401k loans are not an option.

personalfinance,Refinancing 6 months after Closing - Too Good to Pass Up?,"Hi PF, 

I bought my first home about 6 months ago right before the pandemic. Today, I got an email from my original loan officer regarding refinancing to a lower interest rate that would be about 1%  (2.75 with a quarter point) lower than my original mortgage (3.70) or about $140 a payment. My original loan was about $305K. I have been making a little in the way of extra payments and got my mortgage down to slightly under $300k. 

Basically the estimate (non-official) he drew up for me rolled some of the refi-closing costs back into the mortgage and started it back at the $305K, but I would only be out of pocket around only $4K for the refi. I'm not taking into account some of the money that I would be receiving from my current escrow ($2k). 

Online calculators show me as saving about $50K over the course of 30 years and breaking even after about 4 years.  Am I a fool not to jump on this?  My wife and I are having a hard time wrapping my head around basically re-starting at $305k, but I suppose I don't really have to restart if I were to pay around $8k to get me back to where I am today. 

Thank you for your thoughts everyone.",finance
personalfinance,What will paying off a car loan early do to my credit?,"Background:

So in mid-2014, I bought a new minivan for the wife and kids. Sizeable down payment, and good 5-year interest terms (my FICO was in the 800-810 range at the time).  We never missed a payment, and paid the car off a couple months early in Feb 2019.  

I bought a used car in Nov. 2019 to replace my completely worn-out commuter.  Sizeable down payment, 4% interest from the same lender as before.  I currently owe less than $14k on this car, and have never missed a payment.  My FICO score at the time of purchase was over 800.

I did a cash-out refinance to do needed major home repairs in April 2020.  So far we have spent around 20% of that cash on repairs, and plan to use up most of the rest by the end of the year, once our contractor can start the work.

Due in part to the refi, my credit score has dropped to around 730.

Early last month, the minivan was totalled in a hit-and-run accident (not our fault, we are all ok).  We received payout from our insurance company days later.  Of course. It's not enough $$ to replace the  car with a new one, but it IS enough to pay off the 4% loan on the newer car, and along with our savings (not any of the refi money), still put a nice down payment on a new car.

We would be willing to consider a certified used or used car, but:
1.  The wife has a nasal condition that affects her sense of smell.  She rarely can smell anything, but strong pleasant smells (like fresh baked sweets or just-after-rain) can trigger unpleasant smells (like skunk, strong chemical, or moldy towels) that don't go away for DAYS.  She also smells things that aren't there.  Cigarette smell is one of the triggers for ""phantom smells"" and since there is no way to tell for certain if a used car has not been smoked in...  
2.  I have respectable shadetree mechanic skills and tools, but I like to enjoy my weekends.  The idea of a new car with a nice warranty gives me peace of mind.

QUESTION:  We are still looking for a replacement for the minivan.  I don't want to have 2 car payments. I just checked.  My Experian score is currently 739. 

Should I risk the hit to my credit by paying off my current car before we get the hard inquiry for the new car purchase?

Or should I bite the bullet, continue paying on my car normally, and put all the insurance payout towards a huge down payment on the new car with a small payment and a (hopefully) low interest rate?

Thanks, I'll try to check comments periodically for the next half hour, then resume checking 2 hours after that.",finance

personalfinance,Math to decide whether Roth 401k and/or Roth IRA is right for me?,"I am struggling with conflicting information I've heard about when to contribute to a Roth IRA and/or Roth 401k. I've heard that you should always do Roth if your income is below the cutoff, and I've also heard that it's not necessarily the best answer in every case. I know to some extent it depends on the unknown factor of how income tax will change in the future.

Some specifics about my situation: Single filer, HCOL, salary $116k with \~$8k in bonuses = \~$124k gross annual pay. Annual spending \~$51k which is very comfortable so I plan to sustain it (with inflation) indefinitely. Work plan offers the option of a Roth 401k or Traditional 401k. I am just starting out in my career so hopefully there's room for salary growth over and above inflation, but assuming my salary just keeps up: Currently planning to retire at 47, unless I change my mind about buying a house, in which case make that 50. I plan to start a backdoor Roth conversion ladder once my salary is gone.

I'm currently in the 24% tax bracket, whereas my annual spending would put me in the 12% tax bracket (after the standard deduction) if I were to retire now and only withdraw the $51k I need each year. This is why I haven't opened a Roth IRA or used the Roth 401k option -- even if taxes go up in the future, I doubt they would go up THAT much, and I decrease my federal tax liability by \~$4400 by maxing out my trad 401k and IRA, giving my compound interest that much more to work on for the next 20+ years.

Am I thinking about this correctly, and what am I missing? What would you do and why? TIA!

personalfinance,How should I allocate this money I have?,"Hey guys, long time lurker, have read the wiki, and flowchart, occasional poster, and throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I come to you with some questions. My pretax income is roughly 110k. I live with my parents so I don't have too many expenses. No college loans or debt besides small credit cards. I currently have the accounts below:

**401k**\- traditional contributions, vesting schedule so no match yet, I contribute 10%. Invested in Vanguard target date 2060 fund, ER of .05%.

**Roth IRA**\- 12k total invested for 2019 and 2020, in VTTSX (2060 Vanguard target date fund).

**HSYA**\- around total of 24k. Consider this my emergency fund. Not sure when to stop growing it, since I live at home. I add 50 dollars here and there, even though the interest rate is 0.80%.

**Checking account**\- around 20k, no I don't need it all in there.

**Extras**\- I toss 100 bucks into crypto weekly and use Webull for my ""stock gambling"". Don't own a crazy amount of anything though.

**My goals**: I want to retire at 40 ( I'm 24) and am making some moves to try to get there, working on my passions, living below my means, etc. I am familiar with the concept of the FIRE lifestyle, however haven't worked out all details.

In the coming years, I want to possibly get into real estate, so I don't want to over contribute to my 401k since that may affect what mortgage lenders think of me. My question essentially becomes, what to do with the money I am not spending. Based on the very end of the flowchart, I should max out my 401k and then start a taxable account.

If that is the case, I would appreciate recommendations on potential portfolios of index funds/mutual funds/ETFs with my goal to be aggressive as possible with no bonds.

stocks,How stocks fit into a communist utopia,"For all these drones here falling into this Ponzi scheme called the Stock Market, you people need to shape up and smell the socialism.

I copied this from another Reddit user [cal\_student37](https://www.reddit.com/user/cal_student37/) who summarized it succinctly:

***""Inefficient""  doesn't seem to describe the problem. The stock market is very  efficient at growing capital for those who already have it. It's how the  bourgeoisie both exploit profits from workers and maintain legal  ownership over the means of production. Although there are ups, downs,  readjustments, etc. the stock market is generally excellent at  accomplishing this distribution of resources.***

***Most  regular people's interactions with the stock market are through  structured / risk averse retirement funds. Such investors are just there  along for the ride. Although it's a far far far less equitable system  for retirement (say compared to pensions), it still gets the job done.  Just cross your fingers that you don't turn 65 during a recession.***

***People  who do try to ""beat the market"" are essentially gambling their money,  but this is not really the primary purpose of the market and describes a  relatively small percentage of people. Although there are many con man  who will gamble with other people's money while pretending to be what I  described in the previous paragraph. Any legitimate financial advisory  or personal finance literature will recommend against it.***

***In  a lifetime though (and excluding having to begin withdrawing during a  recession), an average person will not lose if they invest with the  flow. That's not to say that they'll get far less form the system than  they deserve, while the bourgeoisie syphon off most of the profits.***

***In  a socialist / transitioning economy, something like a stock market  could still exist to distribute capital. All of the players would need  to be public / socially owned and not private. Furthermore, a mechanism  would need to be implemented so that ""prices"" reflect more than just  exploitative profits.""***

I read a whole bunch of capitalist worshipping idiots here who keep talking about Options, shares, Apple, Google, Elon Musk's used condoms, etc when you should be focusing on advocating a Communist Stock Exchange for Wall Street that should have been implemented yesterday.

Have all the employees of 100% of the companies trading right now own all the stocks.  Get the government to do an asset seizure and redistribute all shares of Google, Apple, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, etc to everyone from temp workers, contractors, and janitors.  Every gets their 1% or equal ownership of the whole company.  Make stocks DEMOCRATIC BABY!

Dont end up like these guys here who talked a good game about investing and is now thinking of suicide and Prozac mixed with scotch.

[https://www.npr.org/2018/12/23/678238031/for-madoff-victims-scars-remain-10-years-later](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/23/678238031/for-madoff-victims-scars-remain-10-years-later)

""At 62, Heimoff was suddenly forced to refinance his condominium in  Oakland, California, and severely cut back on spending. He contemplated suicide. ""

Everyone here could end up like Heimoff and millions of others who got burned.  This wasn't bad luck or stupid investing this was the SYSTEM that you idiots all trade on.

Take one example: Amazon  NASDAQ: AMZN

Shares as of today closed at 2,960.47 USD +5.56 (0.19%)

Sounds impressive right?  Until you read the total fuk job the company is doing to the employees, the sellers, the government, and the public.

As one Amazon seller put it  ""more democracy, less dictatorship"" is what this company needs.

It would seem this could be put to all the companies in the Fortune 500.

Have everyone with a stock portfolio threaten a liquidation sell off until all the companies give their stocks to their employees.  For Amazon and eBay they should give the active sellers on their sites, the janitors, the warehouse workers, even their mailman a piece of their stock no questions asked.  Make stock affordable and accessible to everyone and do it yesterday.  Redistribute stocks!  No more selling at high prices, people get the stock they keep it and pass it down the family.  People can live off the dividends anyway.  The Fed is giving away taxpayer money in the trillions for free after all.  Those fed loans might get repaid in 10000+ years so who cares?

Oh and also get rid of that shit called AAA stock or B stock or whatever crap alphabet soup stock class.  ALL STOCKS should be categorized as 1 CLASS stock.  You either own stock or you don't.  No AAA, XXX, NC17 stocks should exist anymore.

I'm willing to bet when you make big companies like Amazon become EMPLOYEE owned companies their share prices would double in a month.  Everyone has a vote in the company.  No more dictatorships.  America is supposed to be a free society so lets make the corporations a free democracy too.  Noone gets fired or laid off without a vote.  Noone gets the chump change they call a salary that Amazon expects their workers to ""subsidize"" their income with food stamps and fed assistance.  How many of you expect to be joining all those millions of people lining up in soup kitchens and food banks?  If you dont want that happening to you or your kids you better wake the fuck up and demand full on communism in the stock exchange.

personalfinance,What should I do with my savings?,"I have $14k sitting in a high yield savings account, essentially doing nothing since interest rates are at .08%. Some of it is my “emergency fund,” and I’m not even sure how much I need for that. My expenses per month are around $1.5k, so maybe 3-6x that?

Interest rates are super low right now, so I’d like to put some of it somewhere else besides the savings account, where it would grow and accumulate interest. I also add $300-500 to that account per month, so it’ll grow anyways, but I want to be smart with my money and invest it.

I’m single (25f), rent a very cheap apartment, and have no interest in buying a home any time soon (or maybe ever, as my end goal is NYC).
I work as an entrepreneur and am happy with my lifestyle. I make between $4-7k/month depending on sales in my business. Right now, I have everything I could ever want at this stage of life. I am able to travel and work remotely anywhere, and I can take myself to nice dinners, get myself gifts if I want them, and help my family out when they need it. My income has ~x5 within 2 years, and it slowly grows over time. I am not sure if I ever want a home or children, so saving for that is not a priority to me. If I got married my spouse would also be an entrepreneur and high earner, so providing for him is not an issue or concern.

I also have ~$40,000 of student loan debt, but I don’t care about it and it does not affect my life in any way right now. I started with $65k and at this rate am set to pay them off within 10-12 years, throwing $400-500/month at them. They have between 3-6% interest rates. I’ve considered refinancing them.

I started a Roth IRA this month and have $1k in it. I plan to budget to max it out every month.

My main priority is growing my business and growing my income, since it is fulfilling my life’s purpose and helping a lot of people. Any extra money I have goes to the business. My main goal is to move to New York City within the next year.

I'm not doing fabulous, but I have no debt, have an 8-month emergency fund, and have a networth of about 65000. I am even able to save money to take budget trips to Europe (when there isn't a pandemic going on). I'm not actively saving for a house, as I want to move closer to my parents in the next 5-10 years so I can take care of them as they age (they're 65 and retired). 

My parents apparently think I'm on the edge of starvation because they keep randomly sending money. Last time it was to pay for my colonoscopy (which was actually covered by my insurance), but yesterday they mailed me a check for $5,000 out of the blue. I can't *not* accept it, as my parents would be hurt and they would probably find a way to give it to me anyway (I can barely convince mom not to give me half her pantry when I go visit and she keeps sneaking things in). 

Enough of background. Basically, I'm asking for advice on what to do with the $5,000 so that I can save it to help with taking care of my parents as they age. I want to put it somewhere where I can access it without too much of a penalty  anywhere from 5-15 years from now.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Sept 22. Enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, Sept 22, 2020**

Stocks traded choppily before rising in another very volatile session, with traders weighing uncertainty around the presidential election, a worsening coronavirus situation in Europe, and concerns that fiscal stimulus will not come in near-term.  The Nasdaq outperformed, rose 1.86% as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) increased. The S&amp;P finished 1.02% and the Dow finished the day 0.5% up.

The coronavirus situation in Europe has greatly worsened, with experts and politicians warning that a second-wave is around the corner. On September 12, French authorities reported 10,000 COVID-19 cases in one day for the first time since the pandemic began. Since then, daily cases have soared to more than 13,000. Several ""red zones"", cities considered high risk, have seen clampdowns. There is much talk of a second national lockdown in the UK, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcing that there will be further restrictive measures aimed at containing another major outbreak, as the number of cases swells and top scientists warn that the death rate could grow exponentially. On Monday, the UK reported 4,368 new cases. In Spain, parts of the capital Madrid, saw new lockdown measures enforced on Monday. More than 850,000 residents face restrictions on travel and the size of gatherings, according to Al Jazeera. The EU CDC reported that in Spain, there were 300 cases of COVID-19 per every 100,000 people as the capital of Madrid saw new lockdown measures being enforced.

Prospects of more fiscal stimulus passing before the November election have dimmed, with Congress unable to come to a consensus. Today, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified before the House Financial Services Committee. They said that the Fed and Treasury can only go ‘so far so fast’ and cannot replace targeted aid from Congress. “The recovery will go faster if we have both tools \[from the Fed and Congress\] continuing to work together,"" Powell said. Both Powell and Mnuchin credited the Cares Act for helping the economy recover at the height of the pandemic but have once again stressed to Congressional lawmakers the importance of targeted, fiscal aid in helping families and small businesses through these tough times.

personalfinance,Understanding Refinancing (shorter term loan vs longer),"My husband and I are 5 years into a 30-year mortgage with a 3.75% interest rate. 

Looking into refinancing and trying to understand all the different quotes I’ve received, weigh the pros and cons of different conditions, etc.

We have $292k left on the initial loan, paying $2257/month (P&amp;I, plus insurance and property tax).

One quote I’ve gotten so far is for a 20-year loan, payments lowered slightly to $2123, and interest of 2.65%. However, the overall loan amount jumps to $308k including closing costs. 

The caveat is we will probably sell the home within 5 years so the length of the loan doesn’t matter, does it?

Is it better to have a shorter loan and lower payments even if the total loan amount is higher? If we sell, we would pocket less if the loan amount increases, right? So to me it seems not as attractive.

Thanks for helping me wrap my head around this. First time refinancing.",finance

personalfinance,Home Renovations/Repairs -- Refinance or Home Equity?,"I purchased a home about 5 years ago. For simplicity sake let's say it was $110 and I put $5 down. I'm seeing estimates for our home from things like Zillow for close to $275 right now. Our area has had a lot of growth in these 5 years and many homes have been flipped. Most homes a similar size and lot size are easily selling for $250-300 after being updated. I don't expect to move away from this home, it's where I want to live and plan on staying here. The home is about 60 years old and needs some repairs and I would love to update the floor plan and add some square footage. I have great credit (which has improved since purchasing the home) and am wondering what the best path forward is.

Should I do a cash-out refinance thinking/expecting that I'll get a good chunk of cash to put back into the home for repairs and updates and get a lower interest rate? Or should I be looking at a home equity loan? Some kind of combination of the two? Is there another option I should be considering?

personalfinance,Long-term vs short-term student loan (refinancing),"Before you read this, here's some background information:

* I am 22 years old and just graduated with a Bachelors 
* My yearly income is $82,000 (and this should stay constant or increase in the near future)
* I have $110,000 in student debt
* I currently live with parents so I have minimal living expenses. I would, however, like to move out within a year
* I currently have $3500/mo in my budget for student loans

I'm trying to weigh my options when it comes to refinancing my private students loans. In general, I would like to get people's opinion on selecting a long-term loan (say 10-20 years) vs a short-term loan (5 years). Of course, the benefit to short-term loans is lower interest and less interest paid, thus saving money in the long-term. If I were to re-finance with a long-term loan, however, I would still overpay as much as I can and target to pay them off within five years or so. With the higher interest rate I would still be paying more interest, but the difference in total paid wouldn't be nearly as much if paid in a shorter time period. 

For example, based on the quoted rates from Citizens Bank:

If I paid a 5yr loan in 5 years with an interest rate of 3.49% I would spend a total of $121,127, but my minimum monthly payment would be $2019.

If I paid a 20yr loan in 5 years with an interest rate of 4.47 I would spend a total of $124,072, but my minimum monthly payment would be $700.38. 

After playing around with my future budget in YNAB, I have confidence I have the financial discipline to still make at least $2000 payments every month, but having the the lower minimum gives me a lot more room to move around my budget in the case of an emergency (yes, I do also have savings). 

I also have the option of investing the difference, so I could put say $500 a month into a three-fund portfolio (I'm thinking either a non-IRA or an HSA), pay the loan off in 7 years (~$1500/mo) and I should be able to make the difference back with my investments. 

So, what do you think my best option going forward is? Is planning to overpay a 20 year loan a good idea for the sake of lower minimum monthly payments?",finance

personalfinance,Should I Emulate the Great Depression with Student Loans?,"So I have an interesting financial problem / question that I would like  to get some advice on here. So long story short I am a college student  and currently I get refunded from my university about $4300 per  semester. Now the kicker is that these are from student loans. The other  kicker is technically I do not need to have these student loans (I  would graduate debt free if I didn't have them but I figured with the  super low interest rate I have on them it's better to have it and not  need it than need it and not have it). Now also COVID has benefited me  since my loans are not accruing interest so right now all of the money I  have saved from my refunds (Around $17,000) is sitting in a high  interest savings account earning me .8% APR so from a technical  standpoint my I'm currently making money (unless I really do not  understand in which case please correct me). So anyway I was looking at  the financials of the situation and my overall plan to this day has been  to leave that money 100% alone in that savings account and that way the  only money I truly pay for my education is the cost of interest  accumulated over 4 years (which in the grand scheme of things is about  $500 said and done so whatever, $500 is a steal for me to for sure have  financial security in the event of some catastrophe).  Not let me  clarify that I also have additional money stowed away from my job that I  have invested, in savings, and in emergency funds.  
.  
So into the meat and potatoes of the problem I have at hand.  
So  this is going to be very generalized so if I'm wrong in my calculations  please do correct me, I'm not a financial expert by any means. So my  student loans have an interest rate of \~3.5% APR (each disbursement has a  little bit of a different rate but they're fixed once the disbursement  has been made). So for funnies let's say that I took my $17,000 of  student loan refunds and tossed them into broad index funds such as VOO  or VTI (probably a mixture of both) in order to actually make money via  going to college by investing my student loan refunds. Now here's the  math. My loans are 10 years (starting payments required 6 months post  graduation), so if we have $17,000 on a 10 year loan with 4% APR (I  upped it from 3.5% to 4% just to be conservative), then my monthly  payments post graduation would be \~$180 per month for 120 months. This  means that I would be paying $21640 over the course of those 10 years  (obviously that would be a little over $4600 in interest I'd otherwise  not pay. Sounds bad right? Now my idea (and as stated it could be a shit  one so feel free to let me know) is to invest that $17,000 and try to  make money off of the whole shabang. So in theory if I invested my  $17,000 in broad market index funds (assuming a conservative 5% annual  return), in 10 years I would have \~$27,700 which is obviously a little  over $6,000 in profit after having paid off the student loan I would  otherwise not take on (because like I said I've had it planned to just  pay it off the day of graduation and only end up paying $500 or so in  interest for the availability of the capital for the time being). Now I  completely understand that trading on borrowed funds is pretty risky and  not an overall great idea (great depression has entered the chat), but  even if I assume a 4% annual return on the investment over the course of  10 years I still would in theory make a \~$3,500 profit.  
.  
So yeah  that's my current situation. Feel free to grill me for even thinking  about investing with borrowed money because believe me I'm pretty  concerned for myself that I'm even considering this as an option for my  financial plan. Let me know if I really should just stick to the  original plan and just avoid the loan all together or not. All advice is  appreciated! 

.

**Last thing; Like I said up until pretty much this week I have absolutely never considered using borrowed money to make investments but this whole idea came into my head at work the other day and I'm just wanting to see if it's completely off base and out of touch or if it's actually in any form, a viable financial plan. If you couldn't tell by the title I am still likely going to just save the money and pay off my loans immediately but this was a fun thought exercise that I've never considered before and I wanted to see just how absurd it was.**",finance

investing,Paul Mampilly's Secret Portfolio Guesses?,"I sat thru an hour plus long video expecting to get some new ticker symbols for Paul's secret portfolio. He said in his email that he would provide ""an opportunity to get the names for the ticker symbols"". I should've read that closer as that means he was not going to provide them without a catch. This is a subscription that Paul charges $5k for. While I am a subscriber to his ""Profits Unlimited"", and have been satisfied with the results so far, I couldn’t afford the subscription if I wanted to.

I took notes on the video and tried to get as much detail as I could (which is tough because he doesn't allow you to rewind or navigate the video in the interface he shows it on). I did research and think I found a couple, but I was hoping you guys confirm and potentially help identify any of these stocks that he personally invests in. 

I tried to type up what I saw from some of these stocks…

Graphene stocks...

1. Graphene can filter ocean water in a single use, stop rust with graphene infused paint, and can detect cancer in the human body. He mentions gains by G6, Talga Resources, and Tunghsu Optoelectronic (so it can be assumed it's not one of these). Paul predicts Graphene industry to be 13x it's size by 2027. The company he mentions is developing a graphene-based powder that can strengthen any substance. they are a mining company based in Australia. They are also developing a new graphene-powered battery which could charge a phone in 1-2 minutes and electric vehicles in 5. After researching, I believe this is FGPHF. Let me know if you think different.
2. An offshoot of one of the largest industrial firms in Canada. Canada’s federal government is investing in it. A “tiny” company now that commissioned it’s first large-scale production facility with a production line that is 100% automated. This one I'm not sure of.

Blockchain Stocks...

3. Blockchain stock. Soared 26,000% just for ""adding blockchain to it’s name” and Paul thinks it will keep growing. I assume he is referring to the bitcoin boom in 2017. Paul states he thinks Bitcoin will hit $1mil in his lifetime. Not much detail here. Quick google search shows: Riot Blockchain, Hive Blockchain, and Long Blockchain Corp. One of these maybe?

4. This stock is one of the leading crypto miners in the world and the company’s revenues grew 66% last year. Not much info here.

Global energy storage market…

5. 13x growth by 2030. Paul likes an energy storage firm that is developing a new type of battery that can last 20-25 years minimum. Flow battery company with a current value of about $30 million. They’ve done a 180 and are putting everything into a niche corner of the battery market. Completed their first full battery system 2 years ago. Company plans to provide batteries for telecom towers and is expanding into China, New Zealand, and Australia.

6. Company based out of France. A renewable powerhouse that owns over 100 power plants. Completed 7 renewable power plants last year and have another 10 in the works. Recently bought out another company operating 95 power plants and are expanding into Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, South Africa. Company has goal to increase energy output by 570% by 2023. I'm not sure about either of these companies.

Biotech..

7. Biotech….Paul extremely bullish stating this could eleminate cancer, diabetes and other diseases in this decade. A French biopharmaceutical company with 8 cancer-killing drugs in its pipeline. Is able to take T-cells (white blood cells) and transform them into cancer killers. In a study, 30 patients with lymphoblastic leukemia were given this treatment. Within weeks, 27 of them were in remission. This company partnered with Pfizer. Worth under $1 billion and generates less than $50 billion in revenue. If one of the eight drugs in it’s pipeline reaches the commercialization phase, it will receive up to $2.8 billion from it’s partners. I believe this is Cellectis (CLLS).

8. A leader in the use of psychoactive drugs for medical purposes. Wants to design drugs for international use. Recently brought in Canada’s top depression expert as CEO. One of it’s directors is a former law enforcement officer with 35 years experience in drug trafficking. I believe this is Champignon (SHRMF).

SPAC (Special-Purpose Acquisition Company)

9. Innovation on how companies go public. Monopolizing one of the fastest-growing entertainment markets in the world. Currently holds 60% market share. (Could soar 30k+ percent). Not sure, perhaps PSTH?

10. Another SPAC. A ""pure play on American Infrastructure"" with 90% recurring business. Again, not much information so I'm not sure on these ones.

Please let me know if you are able to find anything out and if you have opinions on any of the stocks, feel free to share em!

During the rise of Bitcoin, I kept asking those who were all-in to explain to me the value proposition of Cryptocurrency. I get that it was a form of decentralized and deregulated flow of money and I also understand the benefits of blockchain technology.

All of the reasons for Bitcoins value were justifications for why the price should be as high as it was. At the end of the day, nobody cared about the underlying value they chased  the price up and created a huge market, while all the old boys were told to go and sit in the corner with their boomer talk of bubbles.

&amp;#x200B;

TSLA  
I realized yesterday watching highlights of the battery day presentation that people aren't buying Tesla, they are buying TSLA as if it was a crypto-currency, just the four letters on a stock trading platform, there is almost no evidence to support the current price. In a couple of threads lately I have spoken about the market cap of Tesla being double Toyota, while Tesla aims to produce 5% as many cars as Toyota next year, which inevitably leads to ""It's not a car company bro"". But it is a manufacturing company and there is no way it can sustain it's share price and drag the earnings ratio below 100. Truth of the matter is, nobody cares.

&amp;#x200B;

NKLA  
Have vaguely ridden off the coat tails of Tesla and delivered nothing, put a concreter in as a senior manager, then the CEO and major stock holder has left and the price still hasn't collapsed.

&amp;#x200B;

AAPL  
I don't really even understand the hype for Apple, it is a company with a mature market base, no innovation and overpaid for beats because they don't know what the Public wants any more, yet people will speculate wildly on the share price.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to retail investors buying thousands of dollars of options like they were at the greyhound track, we have effectively zero interest rates. This means the large institutional investors can borrow enough money at almost zero interest and make plays large enough to influence the price of the stock, creating their own profits.

All I am saying is that when the market is this hot and operating completely independent of earnings and economic factors, it reminds me of when a bushfire creates it's own weather. These stocks are being purchased and sold based on nothing. (I mean more than usual)

My idea is to have a currency account in a couple of different currencies and then convert one into the other once the rate is right.

An example would be converting 200000 euros into dollars, and then a few months later converting it back once the rate has changed in my favour.

I guess that would generally be cheaper through a bank account than through a trading account as daily swap rates are usually more costly than yearly interest rates?

What are your thoughts on this?

What would be good and low-price options operating in the EU?

An important consideration is that they would need to be able to manage huge amounts (several 100000 €) without huge cost or paperwork.",finance

personalfinance,Should I move from traditional to Roth IRA?,"Reddit

I’m 26 and my wife is 24 and we love in Florida. I make approximately $49k and she is at $28k per year before tax. I had previously started a traditional IRA in the past for the tax break due to having to owe taxes one year. I only have about $4400 in the traditional IRA. With my job I’ll get a state pension. And if she stays I. Hers long enough, she will too. From my understanding when we add our income and subtract the federal tax break of $24800, it puts us in the 12% tax bracket. My top out pay for my job is $68k (if I’m not promoted). My wife might move positions and make more in the future. 

Should I make the move now and move the money from the traditional Ira into my Roth? The money hit right would be lower to do so. Or should I leave the traditional where it is and just not touch it and start contributing to the Roth from now on?",finance

I know it said contact our local vet if he’s puking but I’m not currently home and my parents are the only ones with him so I’m just trying to find answers. Last night he puked about 5 times with small spots of blood and he’s had entirely runny diarrhea. He’s acting like himself and will drink water and he ate some peanut butter my dad gave him. A few notable things are that he was recently diagnosed with lymes but was done taking his medicine a while ago and he also had an oral tumor removed (not cancerous). I’ve read that even if he’s puking a little blood as long as he’s acting himself then he should be okay but I’m still nervous. What are the symptoms of him being poisoned? We have no idea what he could have ate and the only thing I can think of is some random person must have fed him something. If anyone can give any information it would be greatly appreciated.

stocks,RKT valuation and good entry price,"RKT mortgage IPO'd at $18 and had a bit of a dud IPO compared to SNOW, BIGC, U and AMWL. But, compared to all those other IPO's, RKT's number are much more impressive in the short term.

The biggest worry right now for RKT is how much they want to be valued as a fintech/software company compared to a financial/mortgage company. This has big implications on how large institutional investors will value their P/E and Revenue/MktCap ratio compared to the industry.

Lets take a quick look at their most recent 10Q filed on August 2. Their revenues for 6 months ended June 30 are reported at $6.3B. That puts them on track to have annual revenues of about $14B. Their net income in the same period was $3.5B.

The growth rate of these numbers compared to their same 2019 time period is kind of astounding. They're up 5x on mortgages written, and up 4x on gross revenues. Their expenses only increased by 50%, creating a huge jump in profitability.

The market valuation of RKT right now is at 4x of revenue to market cap. That number seems low, even if you value RKT as a mortgage finance company, and not like a fintech company it wants to be. Their margins are around 5% as per their a quarter report: 
https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Rocket-Companies-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results/default.aspx

The P/E ratio is a bit trickier to calculate, as they haven't had a full year of earnings since their IPO. But doing some simple math, they have 1.883B outstanding class D shares and they had net income before taxes for 6 months in 2020 of $3.481B. This creates a rough EPS of 1.85 for 6 months, which projects to 3.70 EPS for the year. This means that the current EPS is around 5.67. I feel like these numbers are really rough, and I'm open to skeptical review of this if they're wrong. I used the quarterly report for my projections:

https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001805284/cbbd760c-c52b-49c6-8074-728045edca87.html#

Here is the PDF equivalent of the quarterly report:

The biggest threat to RKT right now is the interest rate since the majority of their income seems to come from refinancing. With JPow claiming interest rates will remain near zero through 2023, I don't see RKT having any headwinds for at least the next 3 years.

How is everyone else who is holding RKT feeling about the potential price target of this company? 

Their Q3 projections and guidance are quite impressive. But I feel like they have lots of headwinds regarding their projected market/industry and expected growth.",finance
personalfinance,What to do with my high interest rate personal loan,"I come to you with my tail between my legs on this one.

However, my judgement is obviously impaired, so I come to you all for advice and ideas on how to proceed here. TIA.

My goal is to lower my interest rate and the overall amount that I pay over the life of the loan.  

Both of these refinance quotes sound pretty close.  Can you tell me why to pick one over the other?

Am I right in thinking that quote 2 only costs me $278 more over the life of the 15 year term?  But the closing costs are $596 cheaper in quote 2, which makes me think that I should pick quote 2 even though it's a slightly higher interest rate.

Should I sell $20,000 worth of stock to pay down my mortgage enough to qualify for a refi?

Here's the long version. I bought a condo when I was 24 years old like 5 minutes before the housing bubble burst and the economy tanked. I moved and couldn't sell the property so I've been renting it out.

Current interest rate is 4.875% but I understand my APR is higher, monthly payment $917. I still have 26 years left on my mortgage (due to the HAMP making homes affordable refi)

I've been trying to refi this property for months but because 1. it's a condo and 2. it's an investment property, no broker will even talk to me. I finally found a friend from highschool that's really trying to help me but due to the loan-to-value ratio, I would need to put $20k down.   


I don't have $20k but I do have a stock portfolio I've had good success with (not my 401k or retirement). I can take $20k out there, lose out on any hypothetical potential investment earnings ( my self managed portfolio is up 78% in the last year) but save the interest rate, have a lower monthly payment and with a lower payment still move my term down to 15 years instead of 26 years! 

Now that I type all this out, it sounds like a no-brainer but what am I not taking into consideration. 78% growth is way more than the the few percentage points I'd  save but obviously there's no guarantee at all that trend will continue vs locking in guaranteed savings.   


What about tax implications? What if the economy crashes and i'm forced to finally foreclose on that property that's been under water for so long but now I have a lot of cash into it?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Sept 23. What a crazy day!","PsychoMarket Recap - September 23, 2020

Stocks turned sharply negative again, erasing yesterday’s gains and continuing the decline from the earlier week as investors weighed slowing economic data and the absence of fiscal stimulus. This was one of the worst sessions in September. The SPY finished 2.35% down, the Nasdaq 3.05% down and the Dow finished 1.93% down. 

Tech shares reversed yesterday’s course and sank, leading the broader market down. Big tech stocks, like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) finished around 2% down on average. 

Economic analysts were mostly bearish. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note, “It’s also pretty clear that the rates of recovery have slowed, with only retail sales having completed the V. You can thank the enhanced unemployment benefits for that – $600 per week for more than 30M people, at the peak. It’s hard to be optimistic about September and the fourth quarter, with the chance of a further relief bill before the election receding as Washington focuses on the Supreme Court”.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin once again addressed the urgent need for further stimulus in a testimony before the House Financial Services Committee yesterday. Powell underscored the limitations of the Federal Reserve’s lending powers. He said, “Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy. But for others, a loan that could be difficult to repay might not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.” Mnuchin added that he wanted to reauthorize measures under the Payment Protection Program (PPP) that offered forgivable loans to businesses that stayed open and kept most of their employees on payroll. Unfortunately, any reauthorization or reallocation of funds requires Congressional approval, something unlikely to happen with lawmakers unable to come to a consensus about stimulus and focused mainly on the Supreme Court.

Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, like Fed Chairman Jerome Powell before him, said the central bank believed “additional fiscal support will likely be needed” to lift the U.S. economy out of its coronavirus-related downturn.

Powell warned Tuesday in congressional testimony that a U.S. recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans, ""continues to be highly uncertain.""

personalfinance,Does it make sense to deliberately underpay the IRS on taxes due to low interest rates?,"I will likely owe an additional over $200,000 in federal taxes to the IRS by April 2021, due to short term capital gains in stock trading from 2020. My regular W2 income withholdings obviously will not make up the difference by that time. I have already pulled out the majority of my winnings and paid off the mortgage on my house I closed on earlier this year. 

Would it make sense to choose not pay the IRS on this sum all at once, and instead deliberately enter into a payment plan with them due to current low rates? As long as I pay 110% of tax from 2019 I will not have a penalty, right?",finance

personalfinance,House refinance advise,"I have a 3.85 percent interest rate with 981 monthly payment and owe 141,188 on my 30 year FHA mortgage that I have had since April 2019. 

I am in the process of closing on a 3 percent interest rate quoted at 938.72 a month, 30 year FHA refi with a new mortgage amount of 144,461 and 2,250 cash to close. We plan on moving in the next 3-4 years. 

I was also told I'll be getting check from current lender in the amount of 2,900 for escrow reimbursement 3 - 4 weeks after closing. 

My math is 2,900 - 2,200 = 700, then the additional added to the mortgage is 144,461 - 141,188 = 3,273 - 700 = 2,573 cost to refinance. And I'm saving 47 a month which would equate to taking 2573/47 = 55 months to break even which is 4 and a half years. 

Am I missing something with how much I'd save on interest per year and how that factors in? Thanks for the advice in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Traditional or Roth TSP after a rollover,"I entered into federal employment about a year ago, and from the get go I set up the 5% matching to the Roth TSP (currently have Roth IRA and like how it works). I became vested for the most part after reaching my year mark, so at that point I felt comfortable rolling over my state retirement plan from my previous employer into my TSP, and getting the interest train rolling. So I rolled approximately 17k into traditional TSP, while my Roth TSP has about 5k in it. The thing that is not clicking for me is how the interest is going to accumulate. Because of the significant difference in those two balances now, should I move to a traditional TSP going forward because it already has a significantly higher balance (and thus in my head should compound interest faster)? Or should I continue my Roth contributions and which bucket the money is placed in doesn't really affect how the interest is accumulated. If it matters at all, even though I'm contributing to Roth, the matching from the employer has been in traditional. 

I apologize if this seems like a silly question, but it just hasn't clicked for me yet. Appreciate the help guys.",finance

Here are some excerpts that I've found interesting.

* 'With a total of 68 SMs per GPU and a boost clock of 1710 MHz, the GeForce RTX 3080 GPU delivers 119 peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS with FP16 accumulate, and with Sparsity enabled, 238 peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS with FP16 accumulate. RTX 3080 delivers 238 peak INT8 Tensor TOPS and 476 peak INT4 Tensor TOPS, and double those rates with Sparsity enabled. ' (Page 22)

* 'Today, the default math for AI training is FP32, without Tensor Core acceleration. The NVIDIA Ampere architecture introduces new support for TF32, enabling AI training to use Tensor Cores by default with no effort on the user’s part. Non-tensor operations continue to use the FP32 datapath, while TF32 Tensor Cores read FP32 data and use the same range as FP32 with reduced internal precision, before producing a standard IEEE FP32 output. TF32 includes an 8- bit exponent (same as FP32), 10-bit mantissa (same precision as FP16) and 1 sign-bit. TF32 mode of an Ampere architecture GPU Tensor Core provides 2x more throughput than standard FP32.' (Page 23)

* 'NVIDIA has developed a simple and universal recipe for sparsifying deep neural networks for inference using a 2:4 structured sparsity pattern. The network is first trained using dense weights, then fine-grained structured pruning is applied, and finally the remaining non-zero weights are fine-tuned with additional training steps. This method results in virtually no loss in inferencing accuracy based on evaluation across dozens of networks spanning vision, object detection, segmentation, natural language modeling, and translation. ' (Page 24)

* 'By using PAM4 multilevel signaling techniques, GDDR6X transfers more data and at a much faster rate, moving two bits of information at a time, doubling the I/O data rate of the previous PAM2/NRZ signaling scheme. Data-hungry workloads, such as AI inference, game ray tracing, and 8K video rendering, can now be fed data at high rates, opening new opportunities for computing and new end-user experiences.' (Page 27)

* 'NVIDIA RTX IO is a suite of technologies that enable rapid GPU-based loading and decompression of game assets, accelerating I/O performance by up to 100x compared to hard drives and traditional storage APIs... NVIDIA RTX IO plugs into Microsoft’s upcoming DirectStorage API which is a next-generation
storage architecture designed specifically for state-of-the-art NVMe SSD-equipped gaming PCs.' (Page 30)

* Comparison between the RTX 2080, RTX 2080 Super, and RTX 3080 on pages 12 and 13. About a 30% uplift in non-sparse ML tasks, and a 170% uplift in sparse ML tasks.

personalfinance,Nanny taxes for a parent who wants the Social Security credit,"My husband and I recently hired my dad to care for our 4 month old son.  It was important that we pay him ""above board,"" especially for FICA-- my dad wanted to make sure he got Social Security credit.

Unfortunately, I somehow missed (until today) that we're actually *exempt* from payroll taxes because my son is less than 18 and I'm married to someone who can care for our child.  (Source: [IRS Publication 926](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p926.pdf), page 6)  The way I read it, we should just pay my dad gross wages, which he'll report on his taxes, and we should not withhold ~~federal or state taxes or~~ FICA, *or* pay federal unemployment.  (It seems like we are not exempt for state unemployment in North Carolina.)

First, do I have this correct?  Second, what does this mean for my dad's Social Security?  And finally, is there any harm in withholding and paying FICA, or will the IRS eventually return it to him and he won't have the credit he expects?

ETA: My husband and I are both employed full-time, working from home.  My dad is providing childcare so we can actually get work done during the day.  Also, it appears that the exemption would apply only to FICA and FUTA; ""*Although wages paid to a child, spouse, or parent may be excluded from social security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes as described earlier, these wages are still subject to federal income tax.*""",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thurs, Sept 24. Another crazy day in the market","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 24, 2020**

Stocks traded choppily today, with the market rising throughout the session before nose-diving in the last hour. The benchmarks are now firmly in correction territory, roughly 10% below their record highs at the beginning of the month, erasing the gains from a historic August. Traders are digesting a range of concerns, including uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election, signs of slowdowns in economic growth, dimming hopes for more fiscal stimulus, and worsening trends in Covid-19 cases, particularly in Europe.

After rising in the morning, the major indices cut their gains in the final hour of trading. The S&amp;P finished 0.24% up, the Dow finished 0.17% up, and the Nasdaq finished 0.47% up.

Today, the Labor Department released their weekly jobless claim report, which showed that another 870,000 individuals filed new unemployment claims. This is slightly above Wall Street’s estimates but below the 1,000,000 level that’s become a key marker to measure the health of the pandemic-stricken job market. This data shows that jobs are not coming back at the rate that Wall Street would like and that workers are continuing to struggle to secure jobs in our healing economy. 

Chris Rupkey, chief economist for MUFG Union Bank said, “The labor market losses are stunning in that they show there isn't enough work out there yet in the middle of September nine months after the Covid-19 virus shut the economy down. The stock market is falling again over the concerns for the economy as well they should because the high-level of joblessness shows that the country isn't out of the woods yet and it won't be if the pleading of Fed officials for more stimulus isn't heard by Federal government officials down in Washington.” 

Unfortunately, hopes for more stimulus are looking increasingly unlikely before the November election Congressional lawmakers are at an impasse over how much fiscal stimulus should be passed and to whom it should be directed. And more recently with the tragic passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Congress’ focus is now on the Supreme Court.

devops,Is there an open source container optimized os suitable for kubernetes nodes?,"For those of you who aren't using a managed Kubernetes service like GKE/EKS, what operating system are you running on the nodes?

I was planning on getting an apartment, but everyone at work is recommending that I buy a house young, and in this market so that I can rent the other room to help cover the mortgage and sell it when I am ready to start a family.

why financing is good:

*One would definitely be renting almost cost same as mortgage.

*You could make more in stock market and other ventures then if you just invest it all in one house.

*Mortage interest rates are lower than what average return on the market is.

*inflation makes the money cheaper.

*diversification

*Having money gives you liquidity, don't give that up.

*payments are lower if you lose your job.



why cash is good:

*You're not locked for 30 years.

*Most people are not deciplined enough to take the time to invest in stock market or bond or open a bussiness. So better to use the cash in some pretty safe investment.",finance

How does this change things for you? Would you still consider getting an RTX 3090 for deep learning?

For folks who are thinking of a 4x or greater multi-GPU setup, would you reconsider your choice of the GPU?

Are you going to wait for the TITAN AMPERE or the RTX 3080 20G? Or are you considering 2x RTX 3080 instead of a single RTX 3090? In case of multi-GPU setups, do you think it's better to have multiple 3080s instead of half the number of 3090s for the same budget?

Preliminary [benchmarks](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/RTX3090-TensorFlow-NAMD-and-HPCG-Performance-on-Linux-Preliminary-1902/) show that the RTX 3090 is close to the TITAN RTX. This could mean that the TITAN AMPERE could be much faster than the RTX 3090 or a 2x RTX 2080 could be of much higher value.

The real question, however, is that can you live with the fact that after you invested so much amount of your money in a rig for whatever purpose, only to have it underperform because of some artificial bottlenecks, when in fact it is perfectly capable of living up to its fullest potential?",technology

personalfinance,What do I need to do with my bonus?,"Hey y'all. I had my evaluation at work today and was informed that I was going to be getting a bonus of $3,000. As a side note, I work in the medical field and was told this bonus was for hazard pay. Here's the first road block I've run into, there's taxes on bonuses like everything else.  When I was told $3,000, I'm not sure if they're saying that's the amount I will receive in full, like if my employer will technically be paying more and that's what I will receive post tax, of if 3k is the base amount and I will be taxed at 22%(according to google) and only take home $2,340.  


Nonetheless, I want to use this to pay off some of my debts, but I need advice about what debts I should pay off with this bonus. Going forward lets assume I'll only be getting $2,340 to take home (unless you think that I could actually be taking home 3k). My debts are as follows:  


1. Loan from credit union for previous debt consolidation. $1,500 at a 9% interest rate with a payment of $100 a month. This loan is on a set schedule and is set to be paid off come Jan 2022. 
2. Credit card through Regions. $806. This card has a zero percent interest for 15 months that is set to go out come October 2021 and after that it will have \~23% interest.  The minimum is $25, but I'm paying $65 so the account will be paid and full by the time interest comes around. 
3. Barclays Credit Card. $771. 24% interest with a minimum payment of $29 but I pay $30 just to make it even. 
4. Apple CC. $2,780. $70 minimum payment since the account is so close to being maxed out, 17% interest. This account has been enrolled in the COVID-19 program since March(no interest accrued and account in good standing) , so I have not paid anything on it since then, but I have a feeling that the program won't last much longer.
5. Chase Credit Card. $3,072. 0% interest until March 2021 as part of a 15 month promo when I got the card, and after that it goes up to 23%.  As a note, this balance is not from frivlious spending and was rather used to pay for my online course/exam prep/text books/etc for Medical Coding School.

stocks,PayPal vs Square: Which Fintech Stock Is A Better Buy?,"The COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating digitalization and has led to a spike in online transactions and e-commerce sales. According to PayPal, the penetration of e-commerce as a percentage of retail sales in the first half of 2020 outpaced prior external forecast by 3 to 5 years. Both consumers and merchants are increasingly adopting digital payments as contactless transactions have become increasingly important amid the current crisis.

The rapid penetration of digital payments led to double-digital revenue growth in the second quarter for PayPal and Square. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we will place these two fintech payment firms alongside each other to assess which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.

**PayPal Holdings (PYPL)**

PayPal, which was spun off from eBay in 2015, has emerged as the digital payment leader. In the second quarter, PayPal added 21.3 million net new active accounts, reflecting a 137% Y/Y rise and marking the strongest growth in the company’s history thanks to a surge in e-commerce and digital payments. As of the end of 2Q, PayPal had 346 million active accounts with over 26 million merchant accounts.

The company’s 2Q revenue surged 22.2% Y/Y to $5.26 billion. And adjusted EPS rose 49% to $1.07 as the adjusted operating margin expanded 504 basis points to 28.2%. Total Payment Volume or TPV, which indicates payments processed through the PayPal platform, grew about 29% to $222 billion. Venmo, Paypal’s mobile payments platform, witnessed a 52% growth in its TPV to $37 billion.

Following the strong 2Q momentum, PayPal reinstated its 2020 guidance and in fact, raised it. The company expects revenue growth of 20% and adjusted EPS growth of about 25%. It anticipates adding 70 million net new active accounts this year.

To boost its top-line further and promote touchless payments, PayPal launched QR Code technology in 28 markets globally in May. CVS Pharmacy will be the first retail chain to offer its customers the option to use PayPal and Venmo QR codes at checkout in its US stores. The company will also launch Venmo credit card this year.

PayPal has also expanded its Visa Direct partnership globally to accelerate real-time access to funds for small businesses, consumers and partners across its platform. This collaboration enables PayPal to extend global white label Visa Direct payout services through PayPal and its Braintree, Hyperwallet and iZettle platforms.

On Sept. 22, Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev reiterated a Buy rating for PayPal with a price target of $285 as the Mizuho E-Commerce Tracker showed that unique views across key PayPal partner sites (like Etsy, Groupon and Wayfair) remained strong in July and August and also pointed to potential signs of life in the beleaguered travel category.

The Tracker also indicated that PayPal’s unique views continued to grow ahead of partner websites in the last two months, reflecting persistent share gains for the checkout button. Overall, the analyst expects strong July and August e-commerce trends coupled with share gains to bode well for the company’s second-half TPV. (See PYPL stock analysis on TipRanks)

PayPal stock has rallied about 74% year-to-date and could rise further by 17% in the coming months as indicated by the average analyst price target of $219.77. The stock scores a Strong Buy consensus based on 28 Buys, 5 Holds and no Sell ratings.

**Square (SQ)**

Payment facilitator Square is growing rapidly as consumers and businesses are migrating online at a faster pace amid the pandemic. From February through August 2020, there was a 13.2 percentage point increase in the share of Square sellers accepting online payments and by August, over 40% of all Square sellers were accepting online payments. Also, by August, more than 7 in 10 Square sellers were accepting contactless payments.

The company’s Cash App ecosystem delivered $1.2 billion in revenue in the second quarter, reflecting a whopping 361% Y/Y growth. The Cash App had over 30 million monthly transacting active customers in June. Aside from the accelerated digital migration, Cash App also gained from the impact of Fed stimulus, unemployment checks and tax refunds.

Second-quarter revenue grew about 64% Y/Y to $1.92 billion. But excluding bitcoin revenue, net revenue of $1.05 billion was flat Y/Y. Meanwhile, 2Q adjusted EPS declined 14.3% to $0.18. The strong growth in Cash App revenue was offset by the 17% decline in the company’s core higher-margin Seller business to $723 million. Square’s gross payment volume or GPV fell 15% Y/Y to $22.8 billion.

The Seller segment was impacted by lower volumes as several businesses were forced to close amid the shelter-in-place orders triggered by the pandemic. However, the company stated that the Sellers business improved with each month in the quarter as restrictions eased and more sellers adapted to the contactless platform.

Meanwhile, GPV from online channels grew over 50% and accounted for 25% of the Seller GPV reflecting the rapid adaption of online solutions by the sellers. (See SQ stock analysis on TipRanks)

Recently, the company announced two new features called On-Demand Pay for employees and Instant Payments for employers. These new features will further integrate Square’s Seller and Cash App ecosystems to offer financial services and simplify payroll.

Loop Capital analyst Kenneth Hill has just initiated coverage of Square with a Buy rating and a price target of $169. The analyst sees a great deal of upside ahead in the fintech company, driven by further investment in the business and monetization of the Cash App. Hill also believes that on the Seller side, the SMB network should ""hold in well and continue a sustained recovery.""

The Street has a cautious Moderate Buy consensus for Square with 14 Buys, 12 Holds and 2 Sells. Square stock has risen a stellar 149% year-to-date, so the average analyst price target of $151.77 indicates a possible downside of 2.5% ahead.

**Bottom line**

Both PayPal and Square have strong growth prospects in the digital payments world. If we look at the Street’s consensus and further upside potential, PayPal stock appears to be a better choice than Square currently.

gaming,"Snapchats ""Color Galaxy"" and other .io games are manipulative and only exist to get you to watch ads","So for those of you who don't know, Color Galaxy is a pretty typical .io game where you try to control the board by painting in a border that fills in and claims a % of the map when you connect a section. If you cross someones path before they can complete thier line, they respawn after a few second.  This is nothing new, but its a fun game to play with your friends if nothing else. 

At least it would be if the entire thing wasn't manipulation masquerading as a game to get you to watch ads. When you cross someones path and they die, depending on how long the game has been going you're offered to watch an ad to get back into the game. Once the ad is over, you respawn anywhere in your claimed land. But usually, you spawn near someone who is taking your land so you die instantly. I think the game deliberately places you near other peoples when you respawn to make you watch more ads. And you can keep watching ads to get back into the game FOREVER. So when another player pisses you off for killing you, you can just keep coming back and targeting them over and over until one of you loses patience and quits. 

I think that's the entire .io games scheme. Pry on people's desire to win and be #1 at something an watch their rank go up, then pit them against each other and give them ads to get an ""advantage"" over each other. They know people are going to get salty and keep playing just to beat the person who pissed them off, in fact I think they're counting on that. And there is no end in sight, if you keep playing and actually accumulate a high score, you're points will just reset to 0 at random as new players constantly flood in. There is no way to actually win at this game. But no matter who ""wins"", Snapchat (or whoever is hosting these kinds of games) comes out the real winner because you've wasted your time getting sucked into a pointless game that only exists to get you to play ads. And I'm sure the target audience is children and teens. There is just something so sleazy about this kind of play model.

personalfinance,"Bought a house 9 months ago but now that interest rates have dropped a lot, should I refinance now?","So I closed on a house in January right before the pandemic hit.

investing,The Stock Market Is Less Disconnected From the “Real Economy” Than You Think,"https://nathantankus.substack.com/p/the-stock-market-is-less-disconnected

*If you're not following Nathan Tankus by now, you're missing out on key, relevant economic commentary.* 

&gt;There is one big area you can say that the stock market is disconnected from the economic outlook— size. By definition, it tends to be bigger companies which are on the stock market. So inevitably the stock market can’t capture the thousands of small businesses that are failing. Yet, even here, disaggregation of the S&amp;P tells us a lot. Again, there is a wide and sharp dispersion right now, with average returns for large firms a lot higher than smaller firms. This wasn’t the case in February. More than half the companies in the index have less than $25 billion in market capitalization, and the average year-to-date return for all these companies (equally-weighted) is negative. 

**This wasn't a surprise for me.**  

&gt;Once returns are broken down by sales growth, we see dramatic differences based on sales growth and decline. Returns are in fact highest for companies with the strongest year-over-year sales growth. Among those with sales growth greater than 20% are familiar companies like Amazon and Netflix, but also much smaller companies like Nvidia and Paypal. In other words, tech stock returns are being driven by tech sales.

**This was a surprise, and the graphs on the link explain it succinctly.** 

&gt;This does not mean that stocks, especially the ones that have really run up in price, are avoiding overvaluation. However, that is a different question. If there are overvalued stocks, it is likely caused by companies that have seen the biggest sales growth leading to overoptimistic expectations of future sales growth. Overconfidence reflects the economy and beliefs about the economy, while none of us know the future. But this is a generic point, not an argument for setting aside consideration of the stock market. Stocks with the highest valuation, as measured by forward price to earnings ratio, have in fact gained the most year-to-date.

&gt;Meanwhile, the momentum has flipped in the other direction over the course of September. Stocks that were up the most year-to-date, through 9/2/2020 fell the most on average as of 9/18/2020. If at some point this year Federal Reserve interventions propped up the stock market by “financing speculation”, it doesn’t seem to be now.

&gt;Of course, if the stock market doesn’t do a great job of capturing the fortunes of small businesses, it really doesn’t do a good job of capturing how well workers are doing. But workers are not the economy. If people really mean that the stock market doesn’t reflect workers' economic circumstances, they should say it. That mismatch is also something that’s obvious, and clearly true all the time. Even here, overall sales were supported by the now expired ‘stimulus’ checks and supplementary unemployment benefits, as Joe Weisenthal pointed out six weeks ago. 

&gt;To the extent those elevated sales represented labor’s economic circumstances, the stock market reflected it. Without making any predictions, it’s likely the stock market will continue to reflect sales as they taper off. More generally, workers do tend to benefit from high sales growth. Those factors spill over into a tighter labor market, as J.W. Mason’s new paper points out. The lesson here is that to understand what’s going on, we have to peer past the price indices, and examine the stock market in far more detail.",finance

Believe in history: History repeats and repeats – forget it at your own peril.  All bubbles break and all investment frenzies pass.  You must ignore the vested interests of the industry, the inevitable cheerleaders who assure you that this time it’s a new high plateau or permanently higher level of productivity, even if that view comes from the Federal Reserve itself.  No.  The market is gloriously inefficient and wanders far from the fair price but eventually, after breaking your heart and patience, it will go back to fair value.  Your task is to survive until that happens.  Here is how:
2. Neither a lender nor borrower be: Borrowing to invest will interfere with your survivability.  Unleveraged portfolios cannot be stopped out; leveraged portfolios can.  Leverage reduces the investor’s critical asset: patience.  It encourages aggressiveness, recklessness, and greed.  It increases your returns over and over until, suddenly, it ruins you.  For individuals, it allows you to have today what you really can’t afford until tomorrow.
3. Don’t put all your treasures in one boat: This is about as obvious as any investment advice could be.  The more investments you have and the more different they are, the more likely you are to survive the critical periods when your big bets move against you.
4. Be patient and focus on the long term: Wait for good cards.  If you’ve waited and waited until finally a very cheap market appears, this will be your margin of safety.  Now all you have to do is withstand the pain as the good investment becomes exceptional.  Individual stocks usually recover, and entire markets always do.  If you follow the previous rules, you outlast the bad news...",finance

investing,Advice on marijuana stock,"A little background on me. I’m 22 and this is my first year investing in my Roth IRA. I’ve mainly invested in index funds but left myself $500 out of the yearly $6,000 to invest in something a little more exciting. To make this clear, I’m not trying to make a quick buck and I don’t really plan on touching this money for decades after it’s been invested. I’m intrigued by lower costing marijuana stocks as there’s a chance they become more popular years down the line upon federal legalization.

I’m literally in so much debt from school, so 6 months ago I called them (private loan company) up and got temporary financial hardship since my internship had just ended and I had no job,  which reduced the loan payment a significantly. They were like $1200 a month.

So they just went back up since 6 months have passed and I just got a job this month (right on time(. I paid off the full amount due ahead of next month in addition to my due balance for September totaling over $1600.

But today I get a notification that my credit score went DOWN and I didn’t even know this would happen I’m just like in tears because these loans already cost so much and now it’s like I’m being punished for paying them and I don’t know if there’s a way to dispute this! 

Edit: It’s saying my federal student loan balance went up $28 which is why it dropped. (But I’m signed up for auto payments which they haven’t taken out since Covid started) so idk if this has anything to do with my private loans.

personalfinance,Using US Treasury Series EE Bonds as Alternative to HYSA,"I saw a few people asking about an alternative to Ally HYSA which just dropped from 0.80% APY to 0.60% APY. If you are looking for a LONG-TERM alternative I strongly suggest considering US Treasury Series EE Bonds. While the real-time interest rate of these bonds is barely existent, they are guaranteed to double in twenty years when they reach “maturity.” When you calculate the effective yield on a doubling in 20 years, your annual rate is around 3.5%. To me, this rate can’t be beaten in a risk-free way. I’m the money must stay in the account for 12 months and after that early withdrawal (prior to 20 years) will cost a penalty of three month’s interest. Considering you aren’t even making any interest until you hit the 20th anniversary it’s pretty negligible to me. Of course, for the first 19 years and 364 days you are “losing out” on market interest rates from HYSA, but the doubling at 20 years more than makes up for that imo.",finance

personalfinance,"Future teacher, current student. Loans in deferment, but all accruing interest. Should I wait it out for possible loan forgiveness?","Hi, PF,

&amp;#x200B;

To expand on the title, unfortunately, even my subsidized loans are accruing interest because I apparently dropped to under half time for a semester. I owe about $25,000. The unsubs (loans not serial killers) are accruing the most interest and have the highest rates. The subs are accruing a minimal amount of interest but that interest has yet to capitalize. I am not in repayment. During COVID interest is not accruing. I am going to be a teacher so I have the (albeit small) possibility of student loan forgiveness of up to around $17,000, I think. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think...should I begin paying off the highest interest rate loans now? Or pay off the interest on the other ones before it capitalizes? Or just leave them be until I absolutely have to start paying them back? Or D, none of the above?

&amp;#x200B;

By the way, this sub (there it is again!) has been a dream these last few months. Since COVID hit, I have been on a financial freedom path and I owe it all to you! I have paid off all four of my credit cards, save that last pesky grand. I have opened a HYSA account with 6 months emergency and growing. I opened and then maxed out a 2019 Roth IRA just in the nick of time, and have also contributed heavily to 2020. I 'm learning a bit about investment too! But more importantly learned about Target Date Index Funds from you guys. I have spent much of my free time scouring the archives for information to learn all this, but this particular issue I think just required a fresh set of eyes.

retirement,8 Months Until Empty Nesting - Holy S*** at the Tax Implications!,"We're eight months away from our second daughter graduating from college and getting married.  She has a 5 y/o daughter who is currently our dependent.  I finally got brave enough to crunch the numbers on our federal tax return, and it looks like we will owe over $5,000 more in 2021 than this year due to loss of child/dependent and education tax credits.  Yowch!

We are 54 and hoping to retire at 62.  I will have a good pension from the state education retirement system, and we are planning to cram as much as we can into retirement accounts through work during the next eight years as a supplement.  We will almost certainly take at least one of our social security pensions at 62.

We are in the 22% tax bracket, so trying to shelter ourselves from paying that much more in federal tax (haven't crunched the state tax yet) would require contributing well over an additional $20K per year to retirement accounts.  While that would easily be doable down the road, we meanwhile have been rapidly paying down debts.  Assuming no calamities between now and then, when my daughter gets married, we will have around $25K on a HELOC that we are rapidly paying down (3.5% interest).  My plan has been to pay off the HELOC as quickly as possible (goal = summer of 2022) and then max out the retirement savings.  But after seeing the tax increase we are facing, I imagine I should do some number crunching to determine whether we would be better off slowing down the HELOC payments in favor of sheltering more money.

I have been very gung ho about clearing this HELOC asap, so extending it out does not make me happy.  OTOH, we will be paying less than $75 monthly in interest on it.  Am I missing something, because it seems like we would be better paying off floating the HELOC for a longer period and sheltering more money.",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, Sept 25. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, September 25, 2020**

Stocks were higher today, with the major benchmarks finishing the day an average of 1.5% up. This unexpected rally comes amid a surge of coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe and concerns that more fiscal stimulus will not be passed.

The SPY finished 

After a steady decline from summer peaks through the beginning of September, new COVID-19 cases appear to be on the rise again in the United States. According to data from the *New York Times*, there have been 41,822 new cases per day in the country over the past week, a 14% increase from the previous 2 weeks. Among the states seeing the largest increases in new cases over the past 14 days are Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota.

In recent weeks, Europe has struggled to contain a surge in the number of coronavirus cases, with many countries reporting a record number of infections. In France 16,069 new case of Covid-19 were reported, a record for the country. The U.K., which recently announced plans to lockdown once again, reported a record 6,634. These numbers are worse than in March, at the beginning of the pandemic. In response to the increasingly precarious situation, European leaders decried the failure of countries to work together to collectively defeat the virus and told the U.N. General Assembly today that \`\`the time has come for countries to reinvent international cooperation.” Throughout the pandemic, European nations have fought internally about access to equipment and vaccines, erected barriers among neighbors to keep out virus infections, and struggled to agree on collective solutions to fight COVID.

Today’s rally in the stock market reflects the heightened volatility equities have experienced this month, as concerns over the presidential elections, a surge in coronavirus cases, the slowing pace of economic recovery, and the lack of fiscal stimulus pile up. House Democrats are reportedly working on a $2.4 trillion stimulus plan, which would be down from the more than $3 trillion they originally pursued, but a sum still well above the closer to $1 trillion proposal Senate Republicans had suggested they might accept. 

For their part, monetary officials like Powell and Mnuchin have urged time and again for Congress to pass additional fiscal relief, though the window of opportunity continues to shrink as the November election looms. Eric Rosengren, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, told Yahoo Finance that while the central bank could increase asset purchases to try and support the economy, he was not sure it would be “nearly as supportive, for example, as fiscal policy.”

Taken together, the myriad concerns manifested themselves in a surge in volatility this month, with stocks changing direction from one day to the next and even intraday. Matt Orton, Director and Portfolio Manager at Carillon Tower Advisers said, “We’ve shot up really, really far. We’ve just \[gone\] through a little bit of a corrective process, taking out some of the froth from the really high-flying performers in the information technology space. And right now with an absence of many catalysts as we head into earnings season, we’re likely going to continue to move sideways.”

vet,My dog died from unknown causes - could anyone help me?,"Hi, this is probably a long shot but I just really need to know how my dog died. She was nine years old, 10.8 kilos (although she was rapidly losing weight) and a jack russell/ scottie mix. She was perfectly healthy and then two weeks ago she started drinking largre amounts of water - like 500+ml at a time and she went downhill from there, she vomited in the night and had quite bad haemorragic diarreaha. I took her to our local vet who said she was perfectly fine but they were going to do blood tests to double check; they called us back and informed us she had mild pancreatitis and would need to be on fluids overnight so we took her to the emergency 24hr vets bc they're staffed overnight and she spent two nights in the kennels. She came home fine, if a little dozed from painkillers, and they said she had:

\-Pancreatisis

\- High kidney function

\- High blood glucose

\- A slight problem/ maybe blockage with her bile duct

\- A high white blood cell count (from an infection they couldn't pin point)

\- High liver enzymes

We brought her home, they informed us she might still drink more than usual if she wasnt feeling great and she might be off her food. They sent her home with:

\- 7.000 synulox tabs 250mg (half a tablet every twelve hours)

\- 7.000 desolit tabs 150mg (one tablet daily)

\- 14.000 metrobactin 250mg (one tablet every twelve hours)

\- Gabapentin (0.1 on a small syringe three times a day)

Jinty (her name) was always a really big eater she would eat anything and the vets informed us she was eating when in kennels, and the first night we brought her home she eat slightly less than normal but in the next few days that decreased to almost nothing and then to having no interest in food at all. I managed to get the antibiotics down her for the next four days but finally on the sunday she wouldnt take them at all. We took her back to the emergency vets because she had yellow discharge from her nose and she was starting to do this coughing/heaving thing that freaked me out.

The vet came out and said she was a little bit lethargic, he listened to her chest and said it was clear, he then did a full chest x-ray and said her lungs and heart were clear and healthy. He suggested that we take her to our regular vets in the morning for a blood test, but bc I'm a panicker I asked if he wouldn't mind doing them now (he was really great and said of course) and he came back out 30 mins later to double check she had definately been taking her tablets, I assured him ofc she had I had to force them down her that afternoon bc she refused to eat, he said that she had:

\- A slightly high temperature

\- A really high white blood cell count ( almost doubled from her last test)

\- High glucose

\- High liver enzymes

The vet said he was gonna keep her in and get her on fluids and different antibiotics asap, he really reassured us and said we could call up in the morning for an update. We called and were told she had picked up but still wouldnt eat and they had diagnosed her with diabetes, they were starting her on IV insulin to try and control her sugars. The vets were so great with updates every six hours or so.

They gave her an unltrasound and saw that she had an inflamed pancreas, gallbladder and liver. They informed us that she could have a mass in her pancreas and they needed to get an ultrasound specialist in immeadiately. The couldn't find a mass in her pancreas or anywhere else but she was still detoriorating rapidly and the discharge from her nose was so bad it was bloody and she was still losing weight. The next morning she passed after passing a lot of blood from her nose, the vets told us it could of been a tumor in her nose or brain.

The vets were amazing and she didn't die in pain but I just feel like I need to know what happened to her, if it was something I could've noticed sooner and if I could've prevented it.

Her final symptoms were:

\- High bilirubin

\- High white blood cell count

\- Blood glucose of 18

\- High liver enzymes

\- High kidney function

\- Pancreatitis

\- Bloody discharge from nose

\- High temperature

\- Leathargy

\- Weak back legs

\- Weak breathing

\- Aversion to food

personalfinance,Should I refinance my mortgage? (Details inside),"Hello,

I'm new to home ownership (15 months to be exact), and I don't really have anyone in my life whom I can ask for personal finance advice, so I'm turning to you for advice on possibly refinancing.

Here are the particulars.

* Original Loan Amount $291,000
* Origination Date: May 15th 2019 
* Interest Rate: 3.875%
* Term: 30 years/Fixed
* Current Payment: $1,689.07 (\*Note, I've been paying $2,000/mo since the start of the loan, with the additional money going towards the principal each month).
* Current Estimated Home Value: $330,000 (Zillow), $355,000 (Redfin).
* Credit Score(s): 781 (Transunion), 792 (Equifax).

My goal in refinancing would be to pay overall less interest and shorten the term of the loan, perhaps to 15 years? I do not need to lower my payments at this time. I plan on staying in this home for at least another 5-10 years.

Should I refinance now? If so, how do I go about doing so? Should I consider in person/local lenders or just online lenders?

Bitcoin,Monetary policy in a fully-crypto economy,"Been reading the works of a few monetary theorists and I've been wondering about how a few things would work.


The printing of fiat currency by countries across the globe due to covid is in the view of monetary economics, a feature and not a bug. The ability to make money out of thin air is a powerful instrument that when used judiciously, i.e. ensuring the highest multiplier effect by making sure the currency is immediately spent and continues to be spent without adding to savings, can spur the economy without inflation. 


This is practically impossible as far as I understand with Bitcoin or any crypto currency with a cap on availability. And that is a positive for almost all other scenarios.


In a scenario such as Covid, what kind of instruments/measures do you see being deployed in an economy that only has Bitcoin? Bonus points if the situation is such that the economy is in debt without reserves of bitcoin.

3) Part of the straightening out is tackling old debt (and why the little loan with high interest was paid off) and the $45,000 in loans has been bouncing around between the servicer and the collections agency.  The collections agency had my account marked as closed (possibly due to COVID).  I finally found out that my loans are in Vegas without me and asked for the loans to be reopened to discuss a payment plan to rehabilitate the loans and return them to the servicer in good standing.

4) While discussing the rehabilitation with the collections agent in Vegas, she was really pushing a settlement option really hard, saying that I could take advantage of generous offers of canceling ""up to 40%"" off the total loans.  So that could mean I pay $27,000 and they cancel $18,000 and I take a tax hit in a year with little income, but I don't have that kind of cash so I push for the rehab and it will take a few days to reopen the accounts.  I can even change my mind on the rehab and go for a full or partial settlement up to the point that the loans are returned to the servicer.

5) I tell my aunts and uncles and they are much more interested in the settlement options than I am, to the point that they are asking me how much is in my retirement and any ""cash-value"" items available.  My Thrift Savings Plan (think 401k) has $15,000 left in it after buying a car last year, but unless I start selling off my clothes, dishes and DVD's, I think that's all I have.

So I'm already $12,000 short and I never received a solid ""this-and-this-percent-off"" number from the collections agent, I can really only say that the percentage would be generous, probably tops off at 40% and that it would only be available for a window of several months, up to a year.

Did I err in telling them the soft numbers I was given and now they think these are hard numbers?

Is there something wrong with me for not being giddy at the thought of receiving a ""free gift"" of $18,000 in canceled debt?

Would it be a bad idea to liquidate my retirement to try and settle this debt instead of simply trying to rehabilitate it?

Sorry if my thoughts were a little squirrelly.  It was a long day before they jumped me with this.",finance
stocks,I truly think the stock market will go down more even though I am perma-bull,"This article could not have been illustrated better about the current market situation. It's so good that I have to share it here and ask you guys what you think. It's extremely bearish and I truly believe the worst is yet to come, both for stock market and economy. I understand stock market kinda behaves independently of economy somehow, ever since March low.

Insanely high all time highs, based on nothing besides a stimulus and a promise to print more, pandemic, unprecedented uncertainty, continued job losses, PPP expiring in Oct which means more bankruptcies and layoffs, Covid-case spike in part of Europe and US, SCOTUS vacancy, election year, all on the back of an insane 10 year run.

Literally no GOOD reason to be bullish right now.

Below was the article I read. What do y'all think?

(Sorry I cannot quote the source bc it looks like youtube link is banned from this subreddit)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Why the stock market will go down much more once this Fed/election rally ends:

1. 330 Trillion dollars of very poor credit market debt that needs to be deleveraged and the Fed's 1 Trillion farts can't do anything to stop this.Japan has been doing for 30 years what the Fed is trying to do now. Guess what: it won't work when the world has 330 Trillion dollars to deleverage by at least 50%. We're in a deflationary trap and spiral.
2. Corporate share buyback Ponzi model has come to an end as public pension funds (states, municipalities, cities, etc.) have no tax revenues presently to buy corporate bond issuances to fund corporations who use that very money to buy and drive up their own stock to stuff management's pockets with bonuses.
3. 90 cents of every dollar S&amp;P 500 companies earned in the last 5 years also went towards corporate buybacks combined with an unprecedented issuance of corporate debt and equity dilution helping this endless Ponzi scheme.
4. Economy for over a decade barely growing at 1% average despite all the above Endless rounds of QE for 12 years now, interest rates pushed to zero punishing savers and tax cuts that were really not necessary.
5. Consumer debt to income ratio at unsustainable all time high levels (175 debt to income ratio and climbing higher as well as 12 times debt to savings ratio and climbing higher) with real unemployment (unemployed, underemployed and not counted in workforce) at 50% plus and the remaining workforce seeing their hours and salaries cut.
6. All stock market indicators at all time high levels. P/E over 30, Price to Sales Ratio over 2.5, Enterprise Value to EBITDA over 25, Buffet Indicator (Market Cap / GDP) over 135%, Shiller P/E over 27, Q factor (the market value divided by its assets' replacement cost) at 1.76.
7. Bond market has been screaming major recession/depression and deflation for almost a year with yield curve inverting three times and the 30-year T trading almost at 1% (totally crazy).
8. M3 essentially at zero with consumer (70% of economy traditionally and 90% in 2019) tapped out on debt and 50% unemployed/underemployed.
9. Corporations (30% of economy) already in recession since the start of
10. The corporate bond/debt market in the mother of all bubbles with 90% of bonds trading at one notch above junk status.
11. The IMF has stated that this year, the global economy will experience the worst recession since the great depression. It has also stated that for the first time since the great depression, both advanced economies and emerging markets are in recession with growth in advanced economies at -6.1% with income per capita projected to shrink for over 170 countries.
12. Debt to GDP of all developed countries in the 150-300% range...who would have thought.
13. The stock markets now are comprised of 5 companies representing 25% of the S&amp;P and 40% of the Nasdaq. These percentages are beyond alarming and this never ends well.
14. Healthy stock markets don't go down 35% and swing back up 30% in a matter of a month. This type of volatility always signals lower prices ahead. We're in fact in horrible company...this is the fastest 35% downward move in the stock market. And only two other times the stock markets have gone up 30% this fast: the first leg up of the Great Depression and the first leg up of the Great Recession. We all know what happened afterwards...lower lows over the next year to two years.
15. Bear markets last on average 15 months.
16. Retired baby boomers pulling money out of the stock market like notomorrow, while millennials have no money to invest.
17. For those who are screaming inflation, they are dead wrong. Go study history and study it well: inflation only happens when demand overwhelmingly exceeds supply (which is not even remotely the case, it's actually the total opposite i.e. there is so much supply of everything, we don't even know what to do with it) or when a country prints money over money to serve its debt and has to keep doing that as they can't print fast enough. We have none of those presently as it relates to the USA or the US$.

We are a two tiered system comprised of crony capitalism combined with theworst part of socialism. Large corporations are benefiting during the good times and during the bad times when these same companies who should be going bankrupt or getting bought pennies on the dollar by more responsible corporations or getting merged with competitors are getting selectively bailed out by the Federal Reserve who is picking the winners and losers by their size and too big to fail criteria. Crony capitalism on the way up, socialism on the way down. This my friends is a broken corrupt system.

The stock markets are now trading in swings like penny stocks with all freemarket price discovery destroyed and not an ounce of sound monetary policy left. You have a bunch of douchebag academics (who think they know best) not only fighting mother nature but also fighting the principles of economics where boom and bust cycles need to be normal occurrences left to their owndevices for productivity to improve over time. But the Federal Reservedoesn't give a hoot about the principle of economics and they have becomethe real virus infecting the world because they have us play the game with one set of rules yet those rules are constantly broken by them to be the buyer/lender and owner of last resort and implement their grand scheme of becoming the world's central bank and having the entire world as their slaved. If common folks had this behavior, they would end up in jail. And this is a virus we won't be able to get rid of. Who wants to invest in a rigged market where prices are not based one bit on sound economics like reasonable P/E ratios, earnings, free cashflow growth and dividends where earnings are cratering.

The very timely Coronavirus is the medium that is exposing the fragility of this corrupt, selfish, self-centered astronomically over indebted overleveraged system.",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 28th, 2020.

# **Market volatility expected to continue in the week ahead with Presidential debate and jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/market-volatility-expected-to-continue-in-the-week-ahead-with-presidential-debate-and-jobs-report.html)**
*****
&gt; Stock market volatility, with sharp ups, downs and reversals, is likely to be the norm again in the week ahead, as investors await Friday’s jobs report and watch headlines from Washington and the presidential debate.
*****
&gt; Expectations remain low for a stimulus package from Congress, but as economists downgrade their view of fourth quarter growth because of a lack of further federal virus aid, investors are again looking for some guidance from Washington. The election is likely to be a market focus in the week ahead, as the first presidential debate takes place between President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden Tuesday night.
*****
&gt; Stocks were very volatile in the past week, but the S&amp;P 500 was down less than 1% for the week by Friday afternoon. For the month of September, it is down about 6%.
*****
&gt; “We’re really seeing now a typical September, but under the hood we’re seeing what is potentially a rotation from the large tech stocks to a broader pool of stocks,” said Don Townswick, director of equities strategy for Conning. He expects tech to remain a favorite after the shakeout, and the market tone could change in October if earnings results are good and company outlooks are positive.
*****
&gt; “I think that tends to turn things around,” he said.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the much anticipated September employment report, the last before the election, to show a slower pace of job growth than in August. The consensus forecast is for 920,000 nonfarm payrolls, from 1.37 million in August, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 8.2% from 8.4%. JP Morgan economists said they expect job growth to continue, but they also said the lack of stimulus and aid to the unemployed could slow consumer spending. They reduced their forecast for fourth quarter GDP growth to 2.5% from 3.5% Thursday.
*****
&gt; # Election watch
Michael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said the debate may have more potential to move the market than the jobs report. “Most people talk about these things and get all fired up and nothing happens, but this is such a weird year... This seems like the first big shot to see these guy in action. We think it’s a big event,” he said.
*****
&gt; Schumacher said if Trump is perceived to win, and his chances rise in prediction markets by several points, there could be a positive move in risk markets and the bond market could sell off, sending yields higher. Trump is perceived as better for stocks and the economy, and Biden is expected to push for higher taxes and more regulation, he said.
*****
&gt; “We think that pushes the 10-year yield up to 75 or 80 basis points,” he said. The 10-year has been locked in a range below 0.70% and was at 0.65% Friday.
*****
&gt; “If Biden wins, then the debate is risk off. Then Trump’s chances of winning probably go to 40%, maybe lower. Then the 10-year yield goes to 0.60%,” he said.
*****
&gt; The market was also expected to be volatile in the coming week because of month-end and quarter-end rebalancing, but Schumacher said the stock market sell-off has taken some of the pressure off of the need to realign portfolios and he expects about $9 billion to move into bonds for rebalancing.
*****
&gt; Before the earnings period starts in the second week of October, the market is likely to continue to focus on what’s worrying it.
*****
&gt; “What we have... is a lot of uncertainty related to the election, a lot of uncertainty related to stimulus,” said Townswick. He does not expect the political back and forth over the appointment of a new Supreme Court justice, following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to impact the markets.
*****
&gt; “But the stimulus and election, people can say that’s going to directly relate to earnings,” he said. Townswick said the sell-off so far is not unusual for September, historically the worst month of the year.
*****
&gt; Among S&amp;P 500 companies, Townswick said 70% left their forecasts unchanged or revised them higher after second quarter earnings reports, while 30% reduced them. “If third quarter earnings come in relatively strong, then we could see more revisions upward and that would tend to support the market,” he said.
*****
&gt; Many strategists expect the S&amp;P 500 could decline all the way to its 200-day moving average which was 3,107 on Friday. The 200-day is a widely watched momentum indicator, based on the average of the closing prices in the last 200 sessions. If the index falls below it and stays there, it’s viewed as negative for the market but it often acts as support.
*****
&gt; “I don’t have a target, but I think if that does happen, I would say that is a normal pullback and I wouldn’t expect it to break through and tank. I would say that might be supportive,” Townswick said.
*****
&gt; The coming week is busy in terms of economic data. Besides the jobs report, there is ISM and PMI manufacturing data Thursday. Personal income and spending data is also released Thursday.
*****
&gt; But it is the employment data, the market is watching most closely.
*****
&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said the weekly jobless claims data is sending a positive signal for the jobs report, but not all data matches it. The number of unemployed who have come off of state and special pandemic benefits totaled 2 million over the period between mid August and mid September, when the government collected data for Friday’s jobs report.
*****
&gt; Tilley said he will not be so much focused on the non farm payrolls as on the number of people who say their job loss is now permanent. That number rose by 534,000 last month, to a total of 3. million. It was at 1.2 million in February
*****
&gt; Initially when job losses mounted, many individuals expected their job loss was temporary.
*****
&gt; “The permanent job loss is an indication of an amount of permanent scarring that’s going on in the economy,” he said. “The permanent job loss as a share of unemployment has been more rapid than the previous recessions.”

&gt; # September Bears Strike Again

&gt; The September weakness continued with the S&amp;P 500 Index 9.6% off the all-time high set on September 2 (as of 9/23/20). It is important to remember that after a 60% rally in the S&amp;P 500—and much more in some of the large cap tech stocks—this type of seasonal weakness is normal and expected. We noted in our blog Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year that some type of seasonal weakness could be in the cards.

&gt; Speaking of seasonal weakness, the second half of September historically has been one of the worst periods of the year for stocks, as shown in our chart below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Another angle on this is showing how each day of the year does. Again, we are in the sweet spot for potential rocky seas.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “To see some late-September weakness after a record 60% rally shouldn’t be too surprising,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “What might surprise some investors, though, is that after some of the previous best six-month rallies ever, in a lot of cases, the strength continued going out a year.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the recent rally was one of the best six-month rallies ever for the S&amp;P 500. Looking at all the previous rallies that gained at least 30%, returns are somewhat muted near term. But going out a full year, prices have typically moved higher, up seven out of eight times a year later.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 October Gains Frequently Precede Presidential Incumbent Party Victories

&gt; An interesting aspect of election-year Octobers is the propensity for S&amp;P 500 gains when the incumbent party ultimately retains the White House. Of the ten incumbent victories since 1944, the S&amp;P 500 has advanced seven times, declined twice, and was unchanged in 1944 with an average October gain of 1.4%. Of the nine occurrences since 1944 when the incumbent was defeated, there were six S&amp;P 500 declines and three advances in October. The average October decline when incumbents were defeated was 2.1%. Even excluding the S&amp;P’s 16.9% plunge in 2008, incumbent defeats were still preceded by an average October loss of 0.3%.

&gt; # ""Low Energy"" Energy

&gt; US stocks are looking to close out the week on a positive note with the S&amp;P 500 up over 1%. One sector that hasn't been participating in the rally, however, is Energy. While it just moved back into positive territory for the day, the sector remains at the back of the pack in terms of sector performance. If these levels hold for the remainder of the trading day, it will be the 69th time in the last 200 trading days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector. That works out to more than once every three trading days. Talk about a sector that's in liquidation mode!

&gt; The chart below shows the rolling 200-day total number of days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500. While the current level of 69 is extremely high, earlier this month the rolling 200-day total was even higher at 71. Over this same period of time, no other sector has even seen close to as many days of ranking at the bottom as Energy. The next closest is Utilities as it has been at the bottom of the pack in terms of performance on 36 of the last 200 trading days. It hasn't just been the last 200 trading days that have been rough for the Energy sector. Over the last five years, the sector has been the worst-performing sector on just over 23% of all trading days. Is this what it felt like for the horse and buggy companies in the early 1900s or the ice-harvesting companies after the invention of electric refrigeration?

&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance

&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens.

&gt; But October has become a turnaround month—a “bear killer” if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October’s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**

&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.

&gt; # 5 Real-Time Data Charts To Track the Recovery

&gt; We check in again today on some of the real-time economic data that LPL Research is monitoring to provide timely and valuable insights into the state of the US economy. Traditional economic data is often reported too slowly to pick up the changes that are occurring in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt; The latest data on US COVID-19 cases has shown steady progress since peaking at the end of July. COVID-19 hospitalizations are at the lowest levels since the end of June and are close to the lows of mid-June. The number of positive COVID cases rose over the last week, and while the number of tests performed increased, the positive test rate also increased to near 6% (source: COVID Tracking Project). Further, Labor Day get-togethers may have created the recent bump in transmission, a trend we saw following other holidays over the summer.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Even as much of the real-time data shows a slowing recovery as Americans adjust to the new normal, it’s encouraging that new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates have improved greatly since mid-summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Progress on a COVID-19 vaccine and fiscal stimulus could help the economy and markets in the fourth quarter, but as investors struggle with election uncertainty and US-China tensions remain elevated, it’s likely to be a bumpy ride.”

&gt; Out of all the indicators we monitor, US retail sales had been showing one of the most robust recoveries toward the end of the summer as it exceeded 2019 levels on a year-over-year basis, but the most recent weekly readings from retailers on same-store sales recently slipped back lower than last year (source: Bloomberg, Johnson Redbook). It’s not surprising that consumer confidence levels, as measured by the Bloomberg Weekly Consumer Comfort Index, also dipped on their last reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Driving map routing requests by the Apple maps app exceeded pre-pandemic levels but have since leveled off and is now declining slightly. This real-time indicator steadily recovered from March and April lows as people returned to work or other economic activity, and it’s been continuing at a higher than normal rate as Americans travel by car when they previously may have used public transit or air travel. Public transit usage, as measured by Moovit, is still at only 50% of its baseline level, as working from home has a huge effect on usage numbers in major metropolitan areas.

&gt; Electricity demand is also showing a bumpy recovery. It had recovered, dipped, and then recovered, only to dip again since the start of September. Demand for electricity dropping again potentially indicates a slowdown in the rate at which businesses are reopening or softening demand for their goods and services.

&gt; During the midst of the March lockdowns, the number of diners in US restaurants hit extreme lows of -100% compared to the same time last year. The last reading on this indicator was -45%, coming off a recent peak of -30% on September 7 (source: Opentable). Restaurant bookings could be under pressure as cooler weather makes outdoor dining less comfortable in parts of the country.

&gt; As the seasons change from summer to fall, consumer behavior often changes, too, and the potential for heightened rates of viral transmission grows. We will continue to monitor key high-frequency data and provide updates for clues about the path of the economic recovery as we continue to battle the outbreak of COVID-19 across the globe.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,Dealing with a single credit card that's snowballed.,"So, a bit new to Reddit, but it's been helpful so far. So I've got 1, Wellsfargo credit card. I got it when I was prepping to move out, at the behest of my mother to build credit.

&amp;#x200B;

It was pretty fine at first, I was taught not to treat it like money you don't have, and I've rarely if ever spent it on extravagant things. I still live pretty frugally, try to by food on sale (Split Chicken breast for 99 cents a pound is my favorite sort of deal, doesn't take much butchering either) But it's still caught up with me. I moved out of state with a partner five years back, in a little on bedroom for around 800 a month, working a retail job for Staples. I was planning to for to school, but I never felt very stable in giving it a try, not to mention I wanted a psychology degree, and that takes quite some time (I'm now in a Veterinary Technician Program, and actively in school)

&amp;#x200B;

And the biggest harm I felt the credit card did, was blinding me to seeing that things ""Wee not working."" I mean, I thought if I worked well enough at my job, and lived frugally, I would just be ""Okay."" But the hours weren't there (Staples only highers part-time for none managers, and keeps it under 30 hours a week or so.) I just sort of figured I had to keep plugging away at it, for a promotion, or better circumstance, and it started building up. Before moving back to SC the nicest thing I had bought in Florida was a clearance floor model laptop for around 300, after using my partners for a couple of months.

&amp;#x200B;

In hindsight, I should have talked to my partner about the living arrangement, or at least plugged through school and got prereqs done. I'm low enough income that grants should have paid for most of it. Or at least dropped Staples, since the pay and hours simply weren't liveable. But it was my first job, I held it down for seven years, it was only COVID that finally made them screw me over and I left (I now work at my moms Scrub Store, while going to school)

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm now in SC, living in a Trailer (Cheaper and nice then my last apartment, so no complaints other than dealing with sinking floors we need to repair) getting that paid off, it's 233 a month, paying for electric and internet with roomies. I've really tried to lower my costs even further, with an end goal of a better job, and getting it ALL dealt with.

&amp;#x200B;

But It's still a balance of 14,000 on my Wells Fargo Credit Card, and I work as much as I can while still being able to go to classes, it's about 25 hours a week. We've already made some discussion about using my 529 plan money into paying for my bills, which it is allowed to do, thus they wouldn't be overwhelming me as much, and the money I'm working for can be used to really deal with this card more actively.

&amp;#x200B;

But the interest is still decently high, and the minimum payment has raised, and we've been talking about debt consolidation, talking to the bank directly, and trying to negotiate a better rate. I mean I would LIKE to preserve my credit, I've never had a late bill or missed a payment at least, but it's still a lot, and I want to chip away and deal with it as effectively as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Any financial advice is appreciated, I feel like I've tightened my belt opperately, but I'm still no saint, I've grabbed a game on sale here and there. But I'm mainly looking for the best way to deal with this card, with the best balance of a low-interest rate and preserving my credit, I'm aware one will take away from the other.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, even backrucpy is an option, the trailer, my car, not in my name. But that's of course the nuclear option.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR I've got 14,000 sitting on one Wells Fargo credit Card, and I went to tackle that debt the most effective way I'm able. I'm a College Student for the next 3 or so years, and I manage about 25 hours at 9.5 per a week.",finance

personalfinance,Is it out of the question to ask for a temporary raise while we are understaffed and I'm overworked?,"I work as a manager in a restaurant.  Lately we have had some nasty turnover, and it's harder and harder to run shifts.  I'm the only manager with full time availability, as the others are all in college or high school.  This means I have to work my schedule around theirs.  I'm lucky if I can manage two full days off in a week.  Next week I have to work four 12+ hour shifts back to back, with only 1 day off, and close to 60 hours.  It sucks.

I enjoy my job, but it's getting harder and harder to maintain a positive attitude.  I can't concentrate on  any administrative duties that my boss wants me to work on because I am too busy running shifts.  I have no time off the floor to do anything unless I come in earlier or stay later.  Hate to say I've been thinking of moving on to something else, but honestly I don't know where I would go.  Restaurants are all I know, and I know everyone is struggling right now.

Would it be out of the question to ask for a temporary raise until we can get through this understaffing crisis?  I make a decent salary I guess, but that is only based on me working around 45 hours a week.  If I am getting over 50 or 60, I am not paid any more.  I feel bad asking for that, but I am just not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel here.  I spend so much time working that I feel I have no time to spend with my wife, or for my own personal hobbies.  At least if I was making more money it would be worth it.  Maybe some way to calculate extra money for overtime for each hour I stay after 50 hours?  

Is this something that can be done?",finance

solar,Estimate of $ 90k for 17.5kw system in Illinois,"I am in Chicagoland area and looking to get solar installed. I got a quote of $90k for 17.5kw (just for solar panels and installation) before federal or state credit. I dont have any benchmarks to compare so dont know if its reasonable, but it seems relatively high based on the comments I read in this sud reddit. Can anyone opine if this is fair price?
Also, the salesperson suggested to replace my roof as a part of Solar project as it is about 20 years old. The solar company is a general contractor, so they can sub contract roof to the roofing company. As per the salesperson, I can get 26% federal credit on the roof if the Solar company says is necessary for the solar project. 
It that even legal? It this a common practice?
I am definitely going to call other solar contractors, but looking for some advice from experienced/experts here.",energy

personalfinance,"Is it better to pay down student loans or best to do PSLF and contribute to retirement, HSA, etc?","I have about 450k in debt from total schooling (medicine). I will probably make ~225-250 out of fellowship in 2022 and I keep seeing ""resident pays down 300+k in 3 years!!"", but only to find out that they had a spouse help, had a very high paying job like cardiology, or had a relatively lower amount of debt like 200-250k.

In my case I think that since I have 5 years left until PSLF kicks in, I could dump 19.5k into a 403(b), 6000 into a Roth IRA, 7200 into the HSA yearly, and STILL invest in broad index ETFs, preferred stocks, etc. To me that makes so much more sense to maximize retirement stuff now since there is only 5 years left on the forgiveness (which will forgive about 270,000 off the federal loans). I think that is a no-brainer and well worth the risk of maybe not having PSLF around anymore.

I just know the mantra is pay loans down aggressively, but I think this would make more long term sense. Thoughts? Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Having trouble understanding why my paychecks are taxed so heavily.

personalfinance,Structured Settlement cash out help,"I have been going through a lot of the posts here regarding the sale of structured settlements to help me in my own decision and for the most part I am seeing that it isn’t often encouraged for different reasons. I have done this in the past and overall it gave me and my SO a very positive life change/boost for the long term. The payment stream I exchanged for a lump sum allowed us to pursue education and career goals we would not otherwise have been able to, as well as a failed business venture that was a big learning experience lol. It’s hard to say how the monthly payments would be helping us now, as we are pretty secure financially, but we both feel strongly that we wouldn’t be in the same position today if we didn’t sell and would likely have had more time struggling. 

Anyway, this is just past personal experience and my current debate is whether or not to do this again for different reasons. Currently we have been living with my SOs family, and we split rent of $2.2k. Our other monthly expense is one car payment, $270, car insurance $160, cell phone $350 and approximately 6-700 for gas, food and other shopping. I make $60k a year base before overtime and my SO makes about $40k a year. We have $5k in savings and $9k in retirement. Recently we have been looking to purchase a home as it is becoming difficult living together with so much people, as well as coming to understand how much money is being thrown away into rent. We could continue with our current situation and save more, putting a home purchase several months out while throwing away that high monthly rent and dealing with the stress of a full house or I could cash out the remainder of my annuity. 
Something I didn’t see discussed on this subject is the time value of money or it’s actual worth in the future with inflation. My payments don’t start until 2044 and are $5,075 a month for 240 months guaranteed then continue for as long as I am alive. This amount is very close to what I take home a month now and is comfortable, but by no means a ton of money. I can’t see that it would have a lot of buying power in 24 years. 

So, I want to sell the entire annuity and get as much cash as possible now, use for a down payment on a home and take advantage of current interest rates and market. I would also like to pay of our car loan so we would own both of our cars, and use some money for possible home upgrades to build equity, use it to offset our income to contribute more to retirement accounts and reach yearly contribution amounts. Some would also be gifted to both our immediate families to allow them to move closer to purchasing a home as well. I am trying to figure if like before that this money would be worth more now as far as what it could do for us as opposed to in 24 years. I could only cash out for the 240 guaranteed monthly payments and would keep the life contingent payments.",finance

personalfinance,Credit Union vs Another Commercial Bank,"Hi I just got my first job out of college and I'm currently saving up for my future.

I've already figured out my monthly budget, tracking my spending through a  spreadsheet, future things that I'll need to save for etc.

Currently, I have a bank account  at Wells Fargo (checkings and savings). In the next coming months I want to open another bank account (checkings and savings). Similar to having an emergency fund, but also for certain major purchases (ex. buying a car, saving for a house) and I know it'll be there since I won't need to touch that money often. 

My question is should I use a local credit union or a commercial bank?

I originally was going to use a commercial bank (Chase), but my dad said to use a credit union so that in the future when I buy a car (I am currently saving for one) that I will have a low interest rate on my auto loan. I have no problem with that, it's just that I don't plan to live in my area for that long (2 years) and I might possibly move out of state. Plus if I go out to vacation I wouldn't have access to an atm used by the credit union (I want to avoid atm fees).",finance

So, I've got piss poor credit. It's at a solid 502 currently. Bankruptcy, voluntary repossession, the works. I need to get on top of my credit, because its dragging down my husband's ability to get a house, or even be rented to.

I was young and reckless with credit cards and notorious for bouncing out on phone plans (switching when the late payments got too excessive), car insurance, etc.

I know its gonna be a long process, but I dont even know where to start. I'd like to get it under control so we can get a more reliable car and stable house now that we have a LO too.

Bankruptcy was started in 2016-finalized in 2017

Voluntary repo was in 2019- I bought a jeep with a terrible interest rate, and after the warranty ran out, repairs were becoming more than it was worth

I have Student loans from 2011-2012. They're on hold now, but I still have about 15K, I just keep deferring them

personalfinance,Plane tickets refunded after a year.,"I purchased two round trip tickets from Seattle to Berlin August of 2019. These tickets were on KLM and AirFrance and were managed by Delta. I bought them through Hopper. 

The trip was scheduled for April 6th 2020 and this is when Germany closed its borders due to COVID-19. The airline canceled the flights on April 6th and I got email notification of the cancellation. 

I waited about two weeks to start to figure this out.  Delta went from, here is your itinerary to, we can’t find your ticket info. Hopper doesn’t have any way to contact customer service regarding “past flights”. So I filed a complaint with the Federal DoT. I provided the emails where I purchased the tickets, the ticket number and itinerary, and the cancellation emails from the airline.

They sat on the complaint for six weeks. On July 28th out of the blue I got an email from Air France that copied the federal employee and Hopper legal. The email said Air France wasn’t responsible since I bought the tickets through Hopper. I got all excited for a second thinking I was going to get my money refunded. But nope it was a case of tossing the ball.

I waited until 9/2 to email the federal employee on the email string directly and I asked her how long this normally takes. At this point I hadn’t heard anything from Hopper or received my money. That was the key I guess.

On 9/12 I received a single separate email from Hopper saying the air line had granted a refund and that it might take 1-2 months to get my refund.

Last week I finally got my refund.

Lessons learned/confirmed. Always keep emails, and don’t try to cancel the flights proactively.

personalfinance,Mortgage loan modification question,"Hello, I purchased my home 3 years ago. I have a  30 year fixed rate of %4.95. I put 10% down and pay $97 a month in PMI. This is a federal loan (forget which but fannie or freddie) serviced by Penny Mac. 

I lost my job in April due to my company closing up shop where I was making great money. I work in sales, had a decent base salary but was making almost 2x my base in commission. 

Through Covid and with the extra $600 unemployment benefit I was able to continue making my normal payments. I did not take a forbearance even tho they offered it. 

3 weeks ago I started another job in the same field (software) doing the same function (sales). My income dropped significantly due to the ramp up period a sales job requires. In short i'm still selling software tho with a different company and I sell to a completely different industry. 

 So Penny Mac sent some mail about refi options. I gave them a buzz to discuss. I laid out my entire job situation etc. I did not qualify for a refi, was told I needed to be with my current employer longer and the re-apply early 2021. 

The rep I spoke with transferred  me over to another department. Logn story short they offered me a loan modification. They are willign the re-asses my property and I should be able to cancel PMI because of how much the property has appreciated. They also said they could lower my interest rate down to %3.35 as a loan modification not a refinance. 

If your still with me here is my question: 
- This almost seems too good to be true, what is the downside to accepting a loan modification. Will this go onto my credit report? Is there a way here I can get screwed.

personalfinance,Second refi within 6 months or stay as-is?,"Help my spouse and I decide if it makes sense to refinance our mortgage right now. We just refinanced (closed in June) with our credit union at 3.5% for 20 years. We didn't pay points, and rolled closing costs into the loan so didn't bring any cash to close. The loan is for $260,000, and monthly PITI is $2040. We were previously paying about $200/month less on a 30 year loan with 28 years left at 4.63%. The house is worth $650,000 and we plan to stay here long term. 

We can now refinance at 2.875% (paying something like $150 in points), and will need to bring ~$5,000 to close. Monthly PITI will be $1950. So, we would save net $17,000 over 20 years, but would not recoup that $5,000 paid to close for about 5 years. The refi is through Better Mortgage.

We have about $15,000 in cash and another $40,000 in fairly liquid savings/investments (total of 10+ months of expenses at our current spending level) but plan to replace our deck in the spring, which I estimate will cost $20,000. We are in our mid-late 30s and retirement savings are on track.

gaming,"Video game companies are going downhill very fast, but nobody does anything about it.","How come in every single video game I play that I'd an online game, there are at least 5 feature in the game that should be changed, fixed, removed or added? I'll answer my own question: Nobody cares about quality and only about profit.

Let me tell you a little about myself. I am 18 years old, and have been playing video games since as long as I can remember, starting with the playstations 1 and 2. Back then games were about quality, and there was actual competition over quality on all big brands, everybody wanting to create the best game.

Nowadays I look at games (I mostly mean online games since they are the most popular group) and they are A.) Giant companies who have sticks up their *****. B.) A complete and utter cashgrab, from pay to win to having to pay for skins (The skins thing is perfectly fine imo as it is just asthetic, except for some rare cases which skins can improve gameplay, I'm look at you League of Legends.) Or C.) Small indie games that are very little known or unplayed.

Let's talk about the first category: Giant companies with sticks up their *****.
Now I have played many many different games, and perhaps my second most played game (behind minecraft) would be League of Legends, a multi-BILLION dollar game. Now you would think with all their money, they would be able to higher good teams to run things. Instead we get a decent balance team (decent at BEST) a horrible support team with literally no forums for reporting bugs, issues with the game, feedback etc. And a pretty good(imo) design/artwork team.
Now you would think that one of the most needed things in a game, the support, would be a highly funded group. Instead you get trolls, toxic players (btw swearing in a video game should not be bannable people, its 2020, grow up.) And people who are generally there to ruin your experience. Now this would be fine if it were a rare occurrence, but it happens in around 85%of all games on LoL. This same thing can be said about other companies, such as 2K games, which brings me onto my next point.

Now let's talk about the second issue: A complete and utter cashgrab, and pay to win.
Now for this example I will be using 2K's NBA series. Now I love playing and watching basketball, and have been a fan for a few years now. I started getting into basketball around the same time as I got into NBA2k. Now for a *cough cough* ""small indie company"", they have released many big names, such as borderlands and the NBA series. I'll get right to the point: NBA 2k is one of the biggest game series in the world, with a base price of 60$, the same price as other very big name titles. This game is THE BIGGEST cash grab I have EVER seen. I'm not exaggerating either, I'm being serious. One gamemode, MyTeam is the most pay to win garbage I've ever seen. The only way to be good in this mode is to collect good cards, which either require a lot of luck and grinding to buy a pack, and then get the player you want. Now the catch is you can pay actual money to get these packs aswell, meaning that rich people get to play with all the new shiny cards, while normal people are stuck with the crappy, horrible cards in comparison. Their other big gamemode is called MyCareer, which is essentially like a basketball RPG. Now imagine an RPG game that costs 60$, where you can also spend money to buy literal upgrades to your character. If you do not pay actual money, you will have to grind over 100 hours just grinding offline bots (which are not fun to play against at all) in order to even have a CHANCE to compete with others, making people who paid actual money be able to start playing online faster, letting them get better at the game with more experience than the new players who dont pay actual money. God forbid a build gets nerfed, and then there is 100$ down the drain and you gotta go make another build and spend another 100$. This happens year after year and nobody protests it. WhYYYYYY?????

Now let's get onto #3: Small indie companies.
When a small indie company makes a game that is very popular, they have a good chance of getting offered this big money to give up the rights to the game to a (you guessed it) Giant company with a stick up their *** and a pay to win game. This means that the original owner is no longer putting in the effort to create an actual good game, because who can turn down such a good offer from these big companies. I know I sure wouldn't pass up the money. But the problem arises that these companies do not care about the game in literally any way at all, they only care how much money they make from it. And if a game is making them money, then they have no reason to fix any issues, as they are already making so much money. This means that games are just becoming cash grabs constantly, and the original creators are off in Florida partying it up, while us gamers are stuck playing broken and borderline unplayable games. I really miss when the quality of a game mattered more than just money.

Anyways guys, thanks for reading my rant. If you would like to add anything, feel free to do so. Remember, these are my personal opinions, and I am just trying to bring light to the issues I observe daily. If all us gamers rise up and fight back, they will all go bankrupt if they dont change something, right? I sure hope so haha",technology
defi,OneSwap Series 3-Arithmetic Operations in Solidity,"Different from well-known virtual machines in the industry, such as JVM and WebAssembly, EVM does not support the basic data types commonly applied in programming languages, for example, int, long, char, float, and double, but only one basic data type, the 256-bit-long integer. Such a design makes sense to some extent, for example:

1. The output of the hash function is generally 256 bits
2. 256-bit-long integers are used in the calculation of the elliptic curve
3. 256-bit-long integers can be used to implement rational numbers. In most scenarios, it can replace floating-point numbers and avoid the platform dependency of floating-point calculations.
4. EVM is a VM for interpretation and execution. The interpretation costs are more than the integer calculation. Calculation using 256-bit integers may not be much slower than that with 64-bit integers.

But in this case, it is necessary to design a special programming language (such as Solidity and Vyper) for the EVM, which brings everyone a workload of learning and understanding. Let's first learn what basic data types Solidity provides.

## 

## Integer Types in Solidity

Solidity supports signed integers and unsigned integers with a length of 8\*N (1&lt;=N&lt;=32). The type name is int or uint followed by the length, such as int8, int16, int64, int112, int256, uint32, uint128, and uint256. If with no length followed by int and uint, the length is 256 by default.

How does Solidity implement shorter integers such as int8, int16, int64, int112, uint32, and uint128 with byte codes? It is very simple: in the memory and the stack, these shorter integers occupy the same space as a 256-bit integer, without saving any space; after completing a calculation, just use the ""AND"" operation to clear the useless bits in high digits.

In a word, short integers do not save memory or stack space; on the contrary, they require more steps in the calculation. Therefore, we should avoid using short integers as much as possible—with one exception: when using Storage, we should apply short integers to save space. We will introduce how to save storage space in another article in this series.

The integer operations supported by Solidity, the corresponding operators, and their gas consumption are shown in the following table:

|Operation category|Operator|Gas|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Add and subtract|\+,-|3|
|Comparison|==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=|3|
|Bit field calculation|&amp;,|,!, ^(,) \&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;|
|Multiplication and division and modulo|\*, /,%|5|
|Power|\*\*|10+50\*(the number of bytes of the  result)|

## 

## Integer Overflow and SafeMath

As we know, when integers are represented in two's complement, the following overflow problems will occur:

1. Add two integers a and b of length N. The result needs to be represented in N+1 binary digits. If the result is forcibly truncated to N digits, it may be smaller than both a and b
2. Subtract one of the positive integers a and b of length N from the other, and the result may be negative. If the result is interpreted as a positive integer forcibly, then it may be a number larger than both a and b
3. Multiply two positive integers a and b of length N together, and the result may require 2\*N binary bits to accommodate

When Solidity performs arithmetic calculations on integers of various lengths, the result data produced is the same as the input data in length, making overflow possible in certain scenarios. Overflows often lead to serious program errors. For example, BEC suffered billions of losses in market value due to a [multiplication overflow error](https://medium.com/@peckshield/alert-new-batchoverflow-bug-in-multiple-erc20-smart-contracts-cve-2018- 10299-511067db6536). To terminate the operation of the program when an error occurs, many projects choose the SafeMath library, including the Oneswap project:

    import ""./libraries/SafeMath256.sol"";
    
    abstract contract OneSwapERC20 is IOneSwapERC20 {
        using SafeMath256 for uint;
    ...

The SafeMath256 library is imported here and applied to the 256-bit unsigned integer type uint. This library is only applicable to 256-bit unsigned integers. If you need SafeMath libraries of other lengths, please consider the following questions:

1. Is this necessary? As shorter integers will consume more Gas in the calculation, the best choice is to explicitly convert the short integers to 256-bit integers, and then explicitly convert them back after the calculation.
2. If you have to do this, you can refer to [this article](https://medium.com/3-min-blockchain/safemath-library-for-multiple-uint-variables-solidity-ethereum-b6ec600bf23a)

SafeMath256 and similar libraries follow some simple rules, including:

1. If the sum of addition is larger than any one of the addends, there is no overflow
2. The minus should be less than or equal to the minuend
3. The quotient of the multiplication, divided by the multiplicand, should be equal to the multiplier
4. The denominator of division and modulo operation cannot be zero

If the input parameter violates these rules, the function in SafeMath256 will revert.

The `using SafeMath256 for uint` in the above code enables uint type data in the current contract to call functions in SafeMath256 with an object-oriented syntax. For example:

        uint  public override totalSupply;
        mapping(address =&gt; uint) public override balanceOf;
        function _mint(address to, uint value) internal {
            totalSupply = totalSupply.add(value);
            balanceOf[to] = balanceOf[to].add(value);
            emit Transfer(address(0), to, value);
        }

The `totalSupply.add(value)` is actually equivalent to `SafeMath256.add(totalSupply, value)`. The syntactic sugar provided by solidity allows us to write more concise code.

With SafeMath, the code is more secure, but in order to check the rules, you will pay more Gas, and the EVM bytecode will swell further. Therefore, during a series of continuous calculations, if the input data has only a limited number of digits for sure, we can carefully analyze whether arithmetic overflow occurs in each calculation step to determine where ordinary Solidity operators can be applied soundly. Such a technique is widely used in OneSwap, for example:

            uint stockAmount;
            if(isBuy) {
                uint a = ctx.remainAmount/*112bits*/ * priceInBook.denominator/*76+64bits*/;
                uint b = priceInBook.numerator/*54+64bits*/ * ctx.stockUnit/*64bits*/;
                stockAmount = a/b;
            } else {
                stockAmount = ctx.remainAmount/ctx.stockUnit;
            }
            if(uint(orderInBook.amount) &lt; stockAmount) {
                stockAmount = uint(orderInBook.amount);
            }
            require(stockAmount &lt; (1&lt;&lt;42), ""OneSwap: STOCK_TOO_LARGE"");
            uint stockTrans = stockAmount/*42bits*/ * ctx.stockUnit/*64bits*/;
            uint moneyTrans = stockTrans * priceInBook.numerator/*54+64bits*/ / priceInBook.denominator/*76+64bits*/;

Here we use native multiplication and division operators, not the SafeMath library. The comments in the code indicate the maximum possible length of the data. According to the analysis, the multiplication overflow will not occur when the length is the maximum. There is only one require statement here, which checks the length of the effective digits of stockAmount. After checking, you can safely assume that its length does not exceed 42. If SafeMath is used, each multiplication and division sign will bring a require statement, and the gas consumption will increase significantly.

## 

## Thinking in Rational

EVM and Solidity do not support floating point numbers, which does bring some inconvenience. The floating-point number is a special kind of rational numbers, and its denominator must be an integer power of two. Rational numbers can do the same job as floating-point numbers. A rational number consists of an integer numerator and an integer denominator, which means that it occupies two integers's space.

OneSwap trading pairs return three prices when querying prices: the price of selling one, the price of buying one, and the price of the AMM pool. Each price is represented by a numerator and a denominator, and that involves a total of 6 integers, as shown below:

        function getPrices() external override returns (
            uint firstSellPriceNumerator,
            uint firstSellPriceDenominator,
            uint firstBuyPriceNumerator,
            uint firstBuyPriceDenominator,
            uint poolPriceNumerator,
            uint poolPriceDenominator)

OneSwap uses a 32-bit decimal floating-point number as the compressed representation of the price. When it is ""decompressed"", it forms a rational price, which is represented by the following structure:

    // A price presented as a rational number
    struct RatPrice {
        uint numerator;   // at most 54bits
        uint denominator; // at most 76bits
    }

When calculating the rate, OneSwap uses [BPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp) (Base Points) to indicate the rate, the value of which will be calculated as: variable feeBPS recorded in OneSwapFactory divided by 10,000. For example, feeBPS=50, then the fee rate is 50/10000=0.5%.

When using rational numbers, pay special attention to the significant digits. When OneSwap calculates the amount of Token exchange with the AMM fund pool, it needs to calculate: `reserveStock*(sqrt(numerator/denominator)-1)`, where numerator/denominator is a rational number slightly greater than 1. With floating-point numbers, this expression can be directly calculated, because the sqrt of floating-point numbers can return a floating-point number slightly larger than 1 as input. But in Solidity, if you directly calculate according to this expression, the result of numerator/denominator will be 1, and the final result will be 0, which is unacceptable.

To ensure that there are enough significant digits, we adjust the expression to: `reserveStock*(sqrt(numerator*2**64/denominator)-1)/2**32`, and the corresponding code is as follows:

            numerator = numerator * (1&lt;&lt;64);
            uint quotient = numerator / denominator;
            uint root = Math.sqrt(quotient); //root is at most 110bits
            uint diff =  root - (1&lt;&lt;32);  //at most 110bits
            result = reserveStock * diff;
            result /= (1&lt;&lt;32);

The quotient here will be a number greater than 2\*\*64, and the root of the square root will be greater than 2\*\*32. There are enough digits to ensure the accuracy of the final result.

## Rounding

In C language, we use the `floor` function to round-down floating-point numbers, the `ceil` function to round-up, and the `round` function for rounding-off. Solidity does not support floating-point numbers. How can we achieve similar effects? When performing integer division, the remaining part will be discarded, which is equivalent to rounding down. Therefore, when we need to round down, just use the native division operator.

Rounding up can be achieved with the following techniques:

            uint fee = (amountToTaker * feeBPS + 9999) / 10000;

In OneSwap, this line of statements is applied to calculate the transaction fee. `amountToTaker` is the token that Taker is supposed to get. By multiplying it and feeBPS, we can get the transaction fee that should be deducted. As we mentioned earlier, the transaction fee rate is actually a rational number: feeBPS/10,000. How to round up the result of multiplying it and a rational number? Just add ""denominator minus one"" to the numerator, and then perform normal division.

With a similar principle we can round the rational number `a/b`: `(a+b/2)/b`.

When designing smart contracts, we would rather profit at other's expense than being taken advantage of in terms of rounding. According to this principle, we should round down numbers if it helps; if not, we should round up; rounding is rarely used as it cannot tell who will be benefited.

ERC20 Tokens on Ethereum often use 18 decimal digits of precision. In this case, the rounding error can bring me negligible benefits of no more than 10&lt;sup&gt;-18&lt;/sup&gt; tokens. So it is not that unfair to others.

## 

## Gradual Accuracy Loss

We mentioned earlier that when OneSwap calculates the amount of Token exchange with the AMM fund pool, it needs to calculate the square root. To ensure accuracy, first we need to multiply the numerator by 2\*\*64. However, this multiplication may cause arithmetic overflow!

Is it possible to use the overflow-proof multiplication function in SafeMath256? Although this can ensure that the program will not make mistakes in arithmetic calculations, it also refuses to provide services for users under some normal circumstances, rudely rolling back transactions yet costing Gas without yielding the expected results.

We cannot assert that in most cases the numerator must be less than 2\*\*192. We are not sure that all situations that cause overflow after the numerator is multiplied by 2\*\*64, are caused by malicious attackers. So we need to work out a way to make sure the square root can be calculated normally even if the numerator is greater than or equal to 2\*\*192, even at the cost of precision..

If the numerator and denominator are divided by the N power of 2 in the meantime, the value of the rational number remains unchanged. If in the binary representation of the numerator and denominator, the lowest N bits are all zeros, we can safely shift the numerator and denominator to the right by N bits. If the lowest N bits are not zero but we also shift the numerator and denominator to the right at the same time, it will cause a loss of precision. Fortunately, such loss will be negligible. The following is an example with Python. We can see that whether the lowest 36 bits are zero or not has little effect on the final result.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; 0xfedcba9876543210987654321*(1&lt;&lt;64)/0x123456789abcdef0123456789
    258254417031933725993L
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 0xfedcba9876543210000000000*(1&lt;&lt;64)/0x123456789abcdef0000000000
    258254417031933725999L

Based on this observation, we can tentatively shift the numerator and denominator to the right at the same time until the numerator is small enough that there will be no overflow after it is multiplied by 2\*\*64. The code of OneSwap is like below:

            while(numerator &gt;= (1&lt;&lt;192)) {
                numerator &gt;&gt;= 16;
                denominator &gt;&gt;= 16;
            }
            require(denominator != 0, ""OneSwapPair: DIV_BY_ZERO"");
            numerator = numerator * (1&lt;&lt;64);

There is still a require statement, but it will only roll back the transaction when the numerator and denominator differ by more than 2\*\*128 times, which is almost impossible. Now we can be sure that for most cases, this code can be executed normally, while under some special circumstances, it will harm precision a little bit.

## 

## Table Lookup

As we mentioned earlier, the gas consumption of the power is  ""10+50\*(the number of bytes of the result)"", which is relatively large. Taking the common ERC20 token accuracy of 18 as an example, the result of 10\*\*18 needs to be represented by 8 bytes, so the gas consumption of the expression 10\*\*18 is 10+50\*8=410 , equivalent to hundreds of ordinary arithmetic operations.

When the exponent of the power is not that large, you can use the table lookup method to calculate the power. For example, OneSwap uses the following two functions to help calculate the power operation during the ""decompression"" of 32-bit decimal floating-point numbers:

        // 10 ** (i + 1)
        function powSmall(uint32 i) internal pure returns (uint) {
            uint x = 2695994666777834996822029817977685892750687677375768584125520488993233305610;
            return (x &gt;&gt; (32*i)) &amp; ((1&lt;&lt;32)-1);
        }
    
        // 10 ** (i * 8)
        function powBig(uint32 i) internal pure returns (uint) {
            uint y = 3402823669209384634633746076162356521930955161600000001;
            return (y &gt;&gt; (64*i)) &amp; ((1&lt;&lt;64)-1);
        }

The 256-bit integer x in the above code is composed of eight 32-bit integers, and powSmall selects the i-th 32-bit integer; and y is composed of four 64-bit integers, from which powBig selects the i-th 64-bit integer. With x and y calculated in advance, it can be guaranteed that powSmall(i)==10 \*\* (i + 1), and powBig(i)==10 \*\* (i \* 8).

## 

## Taylor Expansion

Solidity does not directly support square root operations. The sqrt function in the Math library used by Uniswap and OneSwap uses [Babylonian Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method) to accurately calculate the square root. The Babylonian algorithm is a special case of Newton's iterative method used for square rooting. It requires a lot of loop iterations to get an accurate result. Therefore, it consumes much Gas, often more than 4,000 Gas.

Considering that the rational number numerator/denominator, which is rooted here, is a value slightly greater than 1, we are sure that it is less than 1.25 most of the time. So here we can use Taylor expansion to speed up the calculation. We just expand to the third term, which can yield good enough accuracy. After expanding the square root function to the third term around 1.0, we get:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bz3acmk3enp51.png?width=1496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb830253308d272cace9a8b85816ff8ff77c842b

Expressing τ in the above formula as a rational number `x/(2**64)`, we get the following code:

                numerator = numerator * (1&lt;&lt;64);
                uint quotient = numerator / denominator;
                uint x = quotient - (1&lt;&lt;64);
                uint y = x*x;
                y = x/2 - y/(8*(1&lt;&lt;64)) + y*x/(16*(1&lt;&lt;128));
                result = reserveStock * y;
                result /= (1&lt;&lt;64);

This code completes the calculation of `reserveStock*(sqrt(numerator/denominator)-1)` with much less Gas.

What if the range of possible values ​​of rational number numerator/denominator is relatively large in the application, say, in the interval \[1,10\]? At this time, we can divide this interval into several segments according to a geometric sequence, such as eight segments: \[1.0, 1.33\], \[1.33, 1.78\], \[1.78, 2.37\], \[2.37, 3.16\], \[3.16, 4.22\], \[4.22, 5.62\], \[5.62, 7.50\], and \[7.50, 10.0\]. Perform Taylor expansion in each segment, and then record the coefficients of Taylor expansion in each segment in a table. During the calculation, first judge which segment the digit may fall in, and then use the look-up table method mentioned above to get the coefficients.

For all complex functions that accepts real numbers, such as trigonometric functions, natural logarithms, and hyperbolic functions, this ""piecewise look-up table + Taylor expansion"" method could be applied to quickly obtain results with sufficient accuracy. Taylor expansion can fit the characteristics of any function, enabling the calculation of any complex function, even without floating-point numbers in Solidity.

## Conclusion

In this article, we first introduced the integer types supported by Solidity and the calculations performed on these integers, and then explained the problem of calculation overflow and solutions. Then, for the weakness that Solidity does not support floating-point numbers, we mentioned several remedies: using rational numbers instead of floating-point numbers; simulating the rounding of floating-point numbers; ensuring sufficient significant digits within the limit of 256-bit without causing overflow; and calculating complex functions with the least Gas consumption by the look-up table method and Taylor expansion.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Using HELOC as back up emergency fund?,"My husband and I are in the market for a used car. We have enough money in savings to purchase the car outright but felt a little nervous tying up a bunch of cash in the current climate coupled with some personal things (listed below). The original plan was to put a 50% down payment and finance the remaining balance through a HELOC. We've been approved for the HELOC and were wondering if it is smarter to pay in cash and save ourselves the interest payment and use the HELOC in case of an emergency. Paying cash for the car still leaves us money in savings so tapping into the HELOC  would really be used as a worst case scenario. 

It's important to mention we are expecting and I was recently laid off. It's very likely I get some freelance work before I am due  but I don't want to bank on that given my industry was heavily affected by COVID. 

Numbers: 

\- $35,000 - car out the door cost 

\- 3.75% interest rate on the HELOC 

\- $1,200 expected interest over 48 month loan (based on $15k financed) 

Savings - we currently have the below in savings to pull from if we paid cash up front

\- 3 month emergency fund 

\- 50% for car down payment 

\- savings to cover maternity leave, hospital costs, nursery set up, baby stuff

personalfinance,"Terrible job with good benefits pay, or great job with decent pay and benefits?","Recent grad, currently working as a pharmacist for 3letter. Pay is about $55 an hour, so not great for retail but definitely better than if I did a fellowship or residency. Health benefits look pretty great tbh, paying around $85 a month for dental, vision, emergency and more. 

I hate this job, and my hours max out around 30-34 a week, so my after-tax take home is around 70k/year.

I have a few opportunities opening up - one at a big international pharma company through a friend of a friend, where average pay looks to be between 80-100k working 40H per week. Health plan is good but more expensive than what 3-letter provides. However, regular schedule with a much more enjoyable job is a huge plus. 

Other opportunities are working federally, through a fellowship opportunity. I’d be a contractor so there are no benefits which is awful, and the pay would be the lowest at around 70K pre-tax but it’s a huge foot in the door for federal pharmacy (public health is my goal). I have a few contacts at the FDA who mention that if I take this fellowship, there’s a very high likelihood that I will be hired as a full on federal pharmacist after the 1-2 year contract is up.

Additionally, I’ve submitted an application to USPHS and have several different contacts there that are very interested in getting me out to either IHS or BOP for field exposure. 

Relevant info: 

-	I am not married nor do I have kids so I have no problems moving or being involved with travel.
-	I am over 26 so I would definitely need healthcare (can’t live off my parents’).
-	Federal pharmacy or public health pharmacy is my end goal.
-	No firm offers yet from any other company other than my current retail job. Lots of talk and good news but no offer on print yet.
-	Massive student loan debt (nearly 350K)


My current thinking is keep working at my current job until I get something solid from one of the other opportunities (obviously) and then if offered something from Pharma, USPHS, and FDA figure out what to do from there. Pharma I think would be the best start for a younger grad, as a way to quickly get management experience and build up additional relationships in the business facing aspect while using my current experience with the regulatory aspect as a negotiating factor. Then after a few years in the private sector, perhaps become a “reverse lobbyist” and use my industry information and business skills to help out federally as I transition into a federal role.

Obviously this is a lofty 10-20 year plan with a lot of presumptions, but as a pretty basic outline it seems to be decent. I want to get opinions on what people think would be the best option moving forward, or at the very least help me out with different viewpoints that I might not have considered. 


TL;dr - currently working retail. If I get a final offer from pharma, public health, or federal pharmacy, is it worth transitioning if the pay and benefits aren’t as good in the short run?

personalfinance,Helping elderly parent with financial decisions following death of breadwinner,"My dad has, at best, a week left. When he passes my mom will live off his social security (around $1,600/month?) and a small life insurance policy ($250,000). They have no savings and no assets. They currently rent a farm house but my mom will want to be more centrally located when he passes. She has a terminal illness as well that seems to not be progressing so she could realistically have 10 years left but 15-20 years isn’t out of the range of possibility. She wants to move and rent in a condo building. I think that is throwing away money, as rent is more expensive than a mortgage with interest rates so low and housing in her area is relatively cheap. I think she should buy something in the $225,000-250,000 range and then leave it to one of my siblings to inherit. She doesn’t have great credit but my husband and I can co-sign the mortgage and she can use part of the life insurance money to put 20% down. I’m sure there are tax implications I’m not thinking of (both for her and for my sibling who would eventually inherit whatever she buys). Would love any direction or guidance to help make this decision.

Edit to clarify some points: My mom has asked me to help her figure this out. She is overwhelmed caring for my dad and has never been good with this type of thing. The “condo” building she sees herself in starts at over $1,695/month. I have no one’s interest in mind other than her own as my husband and I are doing very well financially and have helped support her and my dad since we were in our early twenties. We would continue to support her with any financial help she needs when he is gone. I know she has worried about one of my siblings (a single father) after she’s gone so I thought it would give her peace of mind to potentially leave something (a house or proceeds thereof) for him and his child. He also lives near her so would happily help with any maintenance/yard work if she were to buy a single family house and my husband and I would fund any repairs. Property taxes are also dirt cheap in her area. There are some of the reasons I though buying made more sense.",finance

Currently getting my Certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) at a local community college

Recently got a job in early 2020 (before covid) as a grant writer for an all-electric carshare / vanpool company in LA which pays 45k annually. I do good work for the community but honestly I really don't enjoy the day-to-day work and I'm so stressed literally everyday because of it.

I want to go to grad school to get my Master's in Geography so I can apply to positions that I find more enjoyable (and most likely get paid more). The grad program is 2 yrs. and will be around 25k total. The reason I'm hesitant to quit my job now is b/c I've never been paid this much before and I don't want to be broke again while I'm in school. 

I'm very frugal so I have a savings and live at home with my folks, so I don't pay rent. All the money I would've spent on rent, I put into my investments (don't plan on liquidating them for at least 5 yrs.) The company I work for is understaffed so I have leverage to bring to the negotiating table. They don't have the time to find someone else and train them.

#### [Controversial facial-recognition software used 30,000 times by LAPD in last decade, records show](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-21/lapd-controversial-facial-recognition-software)

It is now well-known that a number of police departments around  America have made use of facial recognition. But the Los Angeles Police  Department’s has been a particularly heavy user: the LAPD used facial  recognition software nearly 30,000 times since 2009. The figures reveal  the extensive use behind the vague and contradictory information the  LAPD provided about how and whether it uses the technology–the  department often denied using facial recognition at all. While the LAPD  does not have its own platform, it does have access to facial  recognition software through a regional database. The LAPD now claims it  was open about its use, but civil liberties advocates note the LAPD’s  recent denials which were only corrected after being questioned.

#### [Twitter and Zoom’s algorithmic bias issues](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/twitter-and-zoom-algorithmic-bias-issues/)

Social media platform Twitter has come under fire recently for an  image cropping algorithm that users noticed automatically focused on  white faces over black ones. While Twitter claims it tested the service  for bias before deploying it, the company accepts that it didn’t do  enough. Video conferencing service Zoom received criticism for similar  reasons after a PhD student tweeted about a Black faculty member’s  issues with the platform: when using a virtual background, Zoom would  remove his head. There has been debate about the causes of these  complications and whether Twitter’s cropping bias is real, but the fact  that it crops out Black people *at all* when it does not crop out white people renders its algorithm problematic.

Forex,Macro Views - Where Does The Fed's 2% Inflation Target Come From?,"In 1989, New Zealand, a country near and dear to my heart (I even named my dog Kiwi), was struggling to recover from two decades of terrible price inflation and sluggish growth.

Inflation rates had persistently been in the double digits and New Zealanders were understandably upset. People who had invested their life savings in government bonds were nearly wiped out after twenty years of rapid price inflation.

One million New Zealand dollars would have the buying power of roughly 150,000 New Zealand dollars after 20 years of 10% annual inflation. Clearly, that is not an ideal scenario for long-term growth and prosperity.

The country named a new central bank governor, Donald Brash, who had exactly zero experience in macroeconomic policy decision-making – although he had at least studied economics and done some work as an economist, unlike our current Fed Governor.

In fact, Brash studied economics and earned a master’s degree by writing a thesis on how foreign investment damages a country’s economic development. He then went on to earn his PhD in economics by writing a dissertation that had exactly the opposite conclusion.

It was a perfect hedge, since he was almost certain to be right in one of those papers. To that extent, he may have been well-suited for a career as a central banker. Never take blame and never admit a mistake.

Brash’s most senior job prior to becoming governor of the New Zealand central bank was serving as the managing director at the New Zealand Kiwifruit Authority, which oversaw the export of kiwifruit.

This is hardly the career path of a man who would later have the most profound impact on central banks around the globe. In any event, he took the helm of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in 1988.

As the governor of the central bank, Brash was feeling a bit overwhelmed. His preparation for this job was scant and he only knew generally what he was hoping to accomplish.

His command of nuanced economic theory was limited, so when he was asked by a reporter about his inflation target, he was stymied. He stammered and then said that the target was between 0% and 2%.

He later admitted that he just pulled the number out of thin air, making it up because he thought it sounded good.

As luck would have it, inflation dropped sharply, and he was viewed as a central bank savant. His pronouncement of 0-2% as an inflation target was a radical idea at the time, but other central bankers jumped on the bandwagon and pronounced the same target.

Quite quickly, inflation targeting of 2% became the accepted norm. In an attempt to justify this trend, one Fed governor, Janet Yellen, later explained the Fed’s logic in a closed-door policy meeting in 1996:

&gt;To my mind the most important argument for some low inflation rate is the “greasing-the-wheels argument.” When businesses run into rough times, they may be inclined to cut workers’ pay. But in practice, that doesn’t happen much. Even in a severe downturn, businesses are more likely to cut hours, conduct layoffs or keep positions vacant than cut pay. That’s one reason recessions tend to lead to higher unemployment instead of lower wages.  
Inflation helps deal with this problem. When there is a bit of inflation, employers can hold workers’ pay steady during a downturn yet have it decline in inflation-adjusted terms. Inflation creates an adjustment mechanism: An assembly line worker may keep making exactly $20 an hour through a downturn, but in inflation-adjusted terms that pay falls by 2 percent a year, which could make the factory less likely to resort to layoffs.

Essentially, Yellen is saying that people really hate when the nominal amount of money they take home drops, even if the real value of their wages falls. It is this simple truth which drives the central banks around the world to constantly talk about a 2% inflation target.

She is also saying that the central bankers want to give a false impression that the economy is stronger than it really is. This takes some of the pressure off the central bankers and helps them keep their cushy jobs.

Moral of the story? When current Fed chief Jerome Powell and other central bankers talk about the near-sacred 2% inflation target, remember: That number is completely arbitrary, made up by a guy with zero central bank experience.

They want to sound like they know what they’re doing, and that they have a masterful plan to help the economy grow. But if they did, we wouldn’t watch them flounder about as we careen from crisis to crisis, decade after decade.

personalfinance,Would someone mind taking a look at my monthly budget?,"Hi all,

Budgeting wasn't a thing in my household growing up (my parents incomes and expenses fluctuated a ton and never set up a formal budget) and honestly, I don't have much financial literacy. Now that I have a predictable income and housing situation I need a sanity check for my budget. Things are still tight, so I want to see if I can save more if at all possible. I'm recently out of graduate school so I have a decent amount of debt and this is my first ""real"" job and it's very stable. (I work in the government).

My monthly income after taxes, health insurance, and other deductions like my pension is $2275. I have about $40,000 at a 6.7% interest rate (yeah, not ideal) in student debt from undergrad and graduate school. The minimum payment is $295. I've also got a \~$500 credit card balance which I'm trying to pay down ASAP. I don't have a car, my workplace pays for a transit pass, and I ride a bicycle when I can, so my transportation costs are basically 0. 

My monthly expenses are:

Rent is $812 and I pay an extra $6 in renter's insurance

Utilities \~ $95 (laundry, electric, internet, gas, heat)

Student Loans - $325

Groceries - $150

Healthcare - $120

Phone bill -$50

Clothes - $100 (I've been trying to fill out my wardrobe with nice-ish clothes I have to wear for work. Ties, shoes, belts, dress shirts, pants, the occasional blazer. Bleh)

I have a broader 'entertainment' category of things I'm not otherwise sure how to categorize. Spotify/Netflix, restaurants, drinks, museum tickets, that kind of stuff. I have it set at $150. Should I be breaking these down individually?

That leaves me with \~$465 left over.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is to pay off my credit card debt, build up an emergency fund of about a month's pay, and then put more savings and my loans. Is that a reasonable course of action?",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on elderly parents navigating tax lien on their home. Best path forward?,"Howdy! I (32M) am trying to help my elderly parents sort out their huge financial mess. I'm working with them now to confirm details, so I don't have a complete picture yet. But I'd love to have advice on moving forward and see any resources you're willing to point me toward. I'm trying to get a sense of what paths and options lay before them. Thanks in advance for your help, Reddit!

The gist: my parents, both over 65, are divorced but live together. My father owes a huge sum (roughly $1M) in a federal (and possibly state) tax lien imposed on their home in California. He didn't pay his taxes for years, nor did he manage his wealth well, so he has just a few thousand (like six) dollars left in his account. They've gone back and forth with the IRS for years (mom says decades), and they now tell me that an IRS agent recently told them their debt has been deemed uncollectible.

They have roughly $50K left on their mortgage. They're both in poor health, especially my father, who is very much unable to work. They receive some social security. The house is in both their names. I have no idea what it would sell for, but it's in a nice neighborhood and I see similar homes on Zillow selling for around $500K. Mom was deemed an ""innocent spouse"" in their divorce.

The goal: somehow improve this situation or inch it toward sustainability so they can find comfort in their remaining years. My mother is under the impression that, if they sell the house, the money they receive will be split, with the IRS taking dad's half, leaving some portion for them to live off of in a small apartment. I'm not sure that's how it works.

What do you think? Is selling the house the most reasonable path forward, or are they likely to see nothing at all because of the lien? If they are indeed under uncollectible status, is there any way they can somehow shed the lien (unlikely, I'm sure)? Any sense in trying to keep the house? I need to confirm the details of their debts, of course, but are there any other directions you'd point me toward? I appreciate any and all advice.",finance

personalfinance,Need some refi advice comparing three options,"I’ve lurked all over the sub and have found some great info but I’m really not sure which direction to go here and would love some advice. Here is some basic info:

— looking to refi for a lower interest rate/monthly payment. Planning to sell in 5-10 so long term savings isn’t quite as important.

— currently paying 4.5, have about 278k left, five years in on a 30 year loan. The refi would be for another 30. 

— current bank is offering 3.125, 10k in closing costs with origination fees around 1300. Would like to stay with them for ease and less of a headache but don’t want to get screwed either. Appraisal was waived until I asked them to do a rate reduction and now it’s appearing again. They said it’s not up to them whether or not it’s waived. I had committed verbally to using them if they get the interest to 3.1 but then they added back in lender fees and appraisal so not sure if it’s as good of a deal. 

— friend of a friend is a broker offering 2.99, around 6k in closing costs but seems a little less polished (I was using google and a slightly higher origination fee as above). Monthly payments are similar to the big bank, I’d just be saving some in interest over the years. Many of the charges are actually higher than the big bank except for the property and escrow estimates which come in lower but as I understand would be the same no matter who I go with. 

— Better.com is similar to the second option above (3.0, no origination charges) but I feel a little weird doing everything online and not through an actual bank, although I’ve read good things. They also have my taxes on the first page of the LE at like $700 a month and the other two both have them around $470 which seems more accurate. Does that affect what they estimate is my monthly payment? So would it be lower?

Anyway I’m a total noob at this and just trying to get the best deal to give me some dollars in my pocket each month. 

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Buy more points or not?,"I had a question about refinancing my  mortgage. I have 2 different offers from 2 different lenders. One is giving me 2.25% and the other is giving me 2.5%, both are for 30 years.

With the 2.5% my amount at closing would be $7,450, with the purchase of $5,753 points (2.05)

With 2.25% my amount at closing would be $10,480 with the purchase of $8,713 in points (2.866).

The difference in closing costs is roughly $3,000.

We plan on staying in this house for the long haul. The amount we'll be refinancing is \~303,400.

Is it worth paying the extra $3,000 at closing to secure a rate that is 0.25% lower? Or is that a waste of money and just go with the 2.5%? I'm coming down from a 4.125% interest rate.

The difference in monthly payment between 2.5% and 2.25% ends up being around $40.

personalfinance,"With today’s remarkably low interest rates for a mortgage, should I opt for the highest loan possible, assuming I can afford the monthly rate?","I am buying a new construction home, actual value of $348k, to be finished in February 2021.

When I first applied for the loan, I indicated a home value of $330k, and was approved for a $313k loan.  A few weeks later, I went in for the design options, underestimated that $330k price, and the bottom line is now increased to $348k, as previously mentioned.  An earnest money deposit (EMD) in the amount of $27k ($15k original deposit to start the build + $12k design options deposit for exceeding a specific threshold)  has already been given to the builder.  This means that I need to come up with an additional $8k ($348k-27k-313k) by closing to stick with the $313k loan.  If you add on estimated $10k closing costs, this equals $18k, which I have stored in savings as my the rest of my house down payment ($27k + 18k = $45k, aka almost 10% down payment on $348k home, part of which is for closing costs).  This $18k is actually invested in stocks, as I believe I will make another $1k over the next few months til closing (Or I would lose $2k at the most, which isn’t the end of the world).  A small gamble, I know, but respectfully, that’s my decision to make, as a hobby long-term safe investor.

Last night, I was sent an updated loan estimate/approval, which indicated an updated loan amount of $330k based on a $348k house.  This was surprising (I was not expecting, nor asked for, an update) because I felt like I might be getting ripped off, even though, remember, it’s just an ""estimate"".  I believe they revised this loan for two reasons:  1. I underestimated initially with $330k price tag, and 2. They have not recorded the $12k design portion of the $27k deposit in their system yet.

So now for the big question — should I consider the larger loan?  This would mean I would get to keep my $18k in investments, hoping it can annually return more than the 3% interest rate (credit score is 800+) in the extra $17k of the larger loan.

Or, should I stick with my original plan and entertain the $313k loan?

TLDR: Was offered $313k loan, budgeted for it and made deposits for it, saving 18k for downpayment to not need to borrow a penny more.  Now being offered $330k loan at &lt;3% interest.  Should I take it, allowing me to invest my original 18k downpayment instead?",finance

stocks,Federal judge postpones Trump ban on popular app TikTok,"The ruling followed an emergency hearing Sunday morning in which lawyers for TikTok argued that the administration’s app-store ban would infringe on the company’s First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump declared that TikTok was a threat to national security and that it must either sell its U.S. operations to U.S. companies or be barred from the country.

NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for TikTok pleaded with a U.S. federal judge on Sunday to delay the Trump Administration’s ban of the popular video sharing program from app stores set to take effect at the end of the day, arguing the move would infringe on First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.

The 90-minute hearing came after President Donald Trump declared this summer that TikTok was a threat to national security and that it either sold its U.S. operations to U.S. companies or the app would be barred from the country.

TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is scrambling to firm up a deal tentatively struck a week ago in which it would partner with tech company Oracle and retailer Walmart and that would get the blessing of the Chinese and American governments. In the meantime, it is fighting to keep the app available in the U.S.

The ban on new downloads of TikTok, which has about 100 million users in the U.S, was delayed once by the government. A more comprehensive ban is scheduled for November, about a week after the presidential election. Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said he would make a decision by late Sunday, leaving TikTok’s fate hanging.

In arguments to Judge Nichols, TikTok lawyer John Hall said that TikTok is more than an app but rather is a “modern day version of a town square.”

“If that prohibition goes into effect at midnight, the consequences immediately are grave,’” Hall said. “It would be no different than the government locking the doors to a public forum, roping off that town square” at a time when a free exchange of ideas is necessary heading into a polarized election.

Hall called the ban “punitive,” noting that this is “just a blunt way to whack the company now while doing nothing to achieve the stated objective of the prohibition. “

TikTok lawyers also argued that a ban on the app would stop tens of thousands of potential viewers and content creators every month and would also hurt its ability to hire new talent. In addition, Hall argued that a ban would prevent existing users from automatically receiving security updates, eroding national security.

“This is the most immediate national security threat,” argued Schwei. “It is a threat today. It is a risk today and therefore it deserves to be addressed today even while other things are ongoing and playing out.”

Schwei also argued that TikTok lawyers failed to prove it would suffer irreparable business harm.

Trump set the process in motion with executive orders in August that declared TikTok and another Chinese app, WeChat, as threats to national security. The White House says the video service is a security risk because the personal information of its millions of U.S. users could be handed over to Chinese authorities.

Trump has said he would approve a proposed deal in which Oracle and Walmart could initially own a combined 20% of a new U.S. entity, TikTok Global. Trump also said he could retract his approval if Oracle doesn’t have “total control.”

The two sides of the TikTok deal have also appeared at odds over the corporate structure of TikTok Global. ByteDance said last week that it will still own 80% of the U.S. entity after a financing round. Oracle, meanwhile, put out a statement saying that Americans “will be the majority and ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global.”

Chinese media have criticized the deal as bullying and extortion, suggesting that the Chinese government is not happy with the arrangement. ByteDance said Thursday it has applied for a Chinese technology export license after Beijing tightened control over exports last month in an effort to gain leverage over Washington’s attempt to force an outright sale of TikTok to U.S. owners.

MachineLearning,"[P] Using GPT-3 to ""imagine"" novel physical artworks that are produced IRL","**Using GPT-3 text generation to create new artworks as a human-machine collaboration... Forbes article** [**HERE**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2020/09/21/in-this-exhibition-an-ai-dreams-up-imaginary-artworks-that-artist-alexander-reben-then-creates-irl/) **more info and artworks** [**HERE**](https://areben.com/project/ai-am-i/)

“AI Am I? (The New Aesthetic)” is a series of artworks dreamed up by an AI and produced in real-life by the artist or others. A series of carefully curated “start texts” are fed into a text generation AI called GPT-3, which then outputs text that includes a description of an imaginary artwork, along with analysis of that artwork and other supporting text. Usually, a creative idea is conceived by a human and rendered with the help of technology. This series turns that notion on it’s head and represents a human-machine collaboration.

The idea here is not to have a computer ""replace"" a human, rather to work with an algorithm to help spark human inspiration.

**Process of creation:**

* Description text, titles and quotes are generated using the GPT-3 AI using carefully created “start text”
* Output is curated and chosen by the artist (sometimes,from hundreds of outputs)
* When an output is generated that the artist likes, it is fed back into the system to generate more text, this machine-human loop is repeated until the final output is chosen
* Fake names are generated from a neural-network trained on names.
* Birth location, birthdate and artwork year are made from a custom algorithm (unless GPT-3 included them in the description)
* Punctuation, spacing and other technical tweaks are made to the text (nothing that changes meaning)
* The artwork is produced in real life and/or displayed as a wall-tag

**Some examples of artworks along with GPT-3 generated text (more** [**HERE**](https://areben.com/project/ai-am-i)**):**

personalfinance,Can you change financing/terms of the loan 3 days after buying a car?,"I bought a Mercedes-benz gla 2018 3 days ago for autonation. Unfortunately they convinced me to get the extended warranty and prepaid service which they assured me that I can cancel at any time before use and now want to cancel.  I really don't want to finance an extra $6500 (which is the total of the extended warranty and prepaid services.)  I got convinced because he said if I added this he would lower my interest rate from 3.99 to 2.99%, both of these rates beat my bank.  

Additionally they told me it's best to pick the longest loan as I can pay it off early if I want.  So I financed at 72 months.  I now realize that I want to finance for 48 months. How can I go about changing this?  It's important to me that they don't just cut me a check for the mainatence and warranty I want it to come off of the amount financed.  And I want the interest rate computed for 48 months.   

If it helps, I'm still within the period where I can return the car altogether for a full refund and I am willing to do this if it means I can change my financing.  Instead of financing $34450 for 72 months, I'd prefer $28500 over 48 months even if that means I have to pay the 3.99 apr instead of 2.99. I called expressing my wish to cancel yesterday twice. but they said they would call me back and never did.

personalfinance,Refinance or not refinance?,"Looking for advice/discussion

I own a home that I bought almost 4 years ago for $245,000. My loan is a 30 year for $172,000 and so far I’ve paid off around $10,000. The home right now is valued between $310,000-$330,000. 

With interest rates so low I reached out to my mortgage loan originator that’s done my last two mortgages. He gave me a couple options but the one I’m leaning most towards is a 30 year cash out option: 2.875%, increase payment by around $5, net $54,800. 
I would use that money to pay off $6,000 in credit card debt, redo kitchen and tile in the house to increase value and then put the rest in a Roth IRA to build a retirement fund(30 YO, haven’t started yet). Eventually I would take my deposit out and use to buy a second home as an investment. 

The other options he gave me are


30 year: 2.625%, save around $244 per month

20 year: 2.625%, save around $14 per month, payoff home 6.75 years sooner (save around $71k in interest)

15 year: 2.250%, increase payment by around $188 per month, payoff home 11.75 years sooner (save around $123k in interest)

I'm 22 and currently with Wells Fargo because that was the closest bank to my college. I only kept using Wells Fargo due to their proximity but now would like to switch to a bank with a higher checking/savings interest rate.

So I guess my first question is what banks would you suggest? I know with everything going down getting a really good APY isn't likely now so should I just hold off until rates get better? 

My second question revolves around credit cards. I currently only have one credit card with Wells Fargo. If I close my account, do I lose that? It's my longest open account and my credit score is pretty decent right now so I don't want to lose it. Is it possible to not have a checking/savings acct with them but keep the credit card? I'd like to open up other credit cards as well so any suggestions on good ones for young adults would be great! I've heard good things about the new CHASE credit card so I'm looking at that one but I'm open to other suggestions as well.

What I need is to figure out the interest for the next 5 years on either option, correct?

defi,Fact Finance innovative 0% lending rate will compete with COMP &amp; Maker,"Hey fellas. Found a Fact finance few days back thought i'd share. It's a nanocap under the radar because cmc/coingecko are sluggish to haul ass :) 

Anyways it would be no surprise to many of you who have seen the ads on CMC and online about Fact Finance, a new 0% interest rate lending protocol. Unlike Maker and Comp, $fact is a single collateral lending platform designed specifically this way to avoid impermanent loss (meaning 1 fact = 1 fact) and offers a unique borrowing model based on 0% interest rate!

The 0% interest rate lending model is sustained by a 2% One Time Payment fee made to the Fact Liquidity pool which stakers and lenders provide. This allows all borrowers to access loans forever without any additional payment to the pool to payback within 6 months! This ingenious design also aid token price as if the price of $fact, goes up you get to keep your extra fact as well as get your collateral. if the price of fact falls, all u need to pay is the difference in fact! Awesome!!

Same goes for Stakers (a.k.a lenders) who earn a 115% Apy for interacting with the staking contract! broken down as 0.15% ROI daily and a 5% monthly bonus if u stake through a month for the nxt three years! It was so successful that the pool filled to max in 90mins! thats about 400,000 usd staked! which itself is half of circ supply!

Also, their Fact Lending Pool goes live in a few days and a 2% reward goes to all stakers of minimum of 500 fact as well as the launch of their Decentralized Governance token yFACT with a max supply of 10,000. A number in which the team will own no tokens, only stakers of fact in the lending pool will own yFACT.

Yahoo Finance did a piece on them here https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fact-aiming-redefine-defi-lending-115412490.html

The fact team is registered in the UK and are processing papers in Singapore. They also burnt 90% of token supply after distribution to support the value proposition of the lending platform!

Right now, circ supply is 432k as you can see from their API data https://fact.finance/api/data which CMC and Coingecko is yet to fully update. total supply is 3mil with one more burn to go!

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation Loan or Snowball Method,"A little back story here. I went to college and had issues getting federal aid to pay for classes and turned to credit cards to pay for day to day spending and tuition so I could focus on graduating. I have since graduated and landed a well-paying job at $72k annually. About six months ago I had $40,000 in debt spread out amongst 12 credit cards and I attempted to get a consolidation loan to lower the interest rate and merge the payments but my credit score was too low and I was either denied or the interest rate I was given was higher than my actual credit cards. 

Fast forward to today and, after my payment going out on Friday, I will have paid off about $13,000 in debt and paid off six of the twelve credit cards. According to a simulator, my credit score should jump from 572 to 650 after my upcoming payment. Putting me above the credit score threshold for a lot of debt consolidation loans. My question is, is it worth attempting to consolidate my credit card debt at this point to get a lower interest rate or should I just keep snowballing my credit card debt as I have been? I would love to take advantage of a lower interest rate if available but I'm also worried about loan fees costing an arm and a leg.",finance

investing,A useful JPM study about hedging and protecting from volatility,"Found [this](https://am.jpmorgan.com/blobcontent/1383174287837/83456/11_1093_JPM_The_Hedging_Edge_Feb_2014.pdf) study from 2014 made by JPM about a few different beta hedging strategies to reduce volatility, thought I'd share. I think it's quite well-written, easily digestible. It's useful to anyone with a portfolio and about 30 mins of free-time, especially in this uncertain market. It is mainly intended to fund managers but I think it has the same relevance in a retail portfolio as well.

For a summary I collected the strategies that are listed and compared with some (hopefully useful) explanation of the strategy. For better understanding it's recommended to read the study though, hope you enjoy it.

# 130/30

This strategy typically shorts 30% of assets and use the proceeds to increase long positions to 130% of portfolio value.

* **Objective**: To provide above-market returns
* **Risk profile**: High
* **Advantages**: Can generate above-market returns with exposure to best ideas
* **Limitations**: May introduce incremental idiosyncratic risk into the portfolio, doesn't offer significant down-side protection in bear markets
* **Beta exposure**: 1.0

# Long only

It's as simple as it's called.

* **Objective**: Provide full exposure to market (beta)
* **Risk profile**: High
* **Advantages**: Offers full participation to alpha and beta
* **Limitations**: Only benefits when stock prices rise
* **Beta exposure**: 1.0

# Tactical beta

In tactical beta approaches, managers use derivatives to tactically raise or reduce equity market exposure. Specific strategies to increase stock market exposure may include buying call options on individual stocks or market indices and writing put options on stocks that the investor seeks to own. Specific strategies to reduce (or hedge) market exposure may include buying put options on individual stocks or stock indices or writing covered call options on stocks that the fund owns.

* **Objective**: Use active management to adjust the beta exposure as the market changes
* **Risk profile**: High
* **Advantages**: Offers the greatest flexibility in market exposure
* **Limitations**: Returns may be less predictable than other equity strategies
* **Beta exposure**: Flexible, 0.0 - 1.0

# Covered calls/buy-write

In a covered call (sometimes known as a buy-write strategy), managers sell call options on stocks held in a portfolio. The manager of the strategy sells options to generate cash, thereby guaranteeing a modest return from them.

* **Objective**: Generate income or partial cushion against losses, or both
* **Risk profile**: Moderate
* **Advantages**: Provides potential premium income and dampens volatility
* **Limitations**: Tends to underperform in sharply rising markets
* **Beta exposure**: Flexible, 0.6 - 0.9

# Long/short

In long/short equity strategies, managers have the ability to buy (go long) securities they expect to outperform the stocks within their sector and sell (go short) borrowed securities they expect to underperform.

* **Objective**: Provide attractive risk-adjusted returns by creating alpha on long and short positions
* **Risk profile**: Moderate
* **Advantages**: May offer some downside protection by reducing overall market exposure
* **Limitations**: Does not fully participate in up markets; may also introduce incremental idiosyncratic risk into the portfolio
* **Beta exposure**: Flexible, 0.3 to 0.7

# Hedging equity/options overlay

Hedged equity strategies (sometimes known as options overlay strategies) reduce risk by trading put and call options around an underlying stock index.

* **Objective**: Provide downside protection by applying an options based hedging strategy
* **Risk profile**: Moderate
* **Advantages**: May provide systematic downside protection by using options to protect capital, while providing long exposure through underlying equities
* **Limitations**: Forgoes some upside participation in return for downside protection
* **Beta exposure**: Flexible, averages 0.5

# Market neutral

Market neutral strategies and other absolute return investments pursue positive returns no matter what happens to the economy, interest rates or financial markets.

* **Objective**: Neutralise equity beta exposure and deliver total returns solely from stock selection alpha
* **Risk profile**: Low
* **Advantages**: Can provide uncorrelated market returns
* **Limitations**: Can be difficult for managers to maintain beta of zero; limited upside in bull markets. May introduce incremental idiosyncratic risk into the portfolio
* **Beta exposure**: 0.0

# Tail risk/negative correlation

There are a number of ways investors can employ tail risk hedging. One is to limit the risk in one’s asset allocation by weighting portfolios to less volatile sectors. Another method is to complement one’s asset allocation with option strategies or strategies that introduce asymmetric return patterns. The most explicit and predictable method of hedging against tail risk has been the purchase of put options on indices such as the S&amp;P 500, which can work effectively as an insurance contract against any dramatic event. Another way to hedge equity exposure is to invest in strategies or securities that are negatively correlated with equities.

* **Objective**: Provide hedge to volatility or left-tail events
* **Risk profile**: Low
* **Advantages**: May provide short-term hedges against sharp market declines
* **Limitations**: Can be less reliable as a hedge if correlations break down; can be expensive
* **Beta exposure**: -1.0",finance

personalfinance,New mortgage company offering to lower interest rate with no penalty or payment from me,"I have an FHA loan and my original mortgage company was recently acquired by another.

""You can choose to keep your remaining term the same, or reset it to 30 years for more monthly savings.

You’d also skip a mortgage payment after closing, which is a very nice added benefit to this program.

Now, this is not like a typical refinance;  there is no credit check, no appraisal, and no income or asset verification.

personalfinance,Rebuilding credit/credit cards/student loan default— advice needed,"Student loans have been the biggest burden of my life but I’m finally getting them under control and am on the path to rebuilding my credit. I defaulted on 4 of my 5 Wells Fargo student loans. I had about $80K in debt to start and I was making $35k a year out of college.... my payments were one big payment of $1.2k+/month($240 per loan). I was paying as much as I could each month (between $700-$900) but WFB split the payments up and applied them across my loans ($140-$180 per loan). I racked up hundreds of dollars in late fees and late payments because if you don’t satisfy the minimum pmt for each loan, then they hit you with a late fee for every loan and report it to the credit bureaus until 4 of my 5 WFB loans defaulted in 2017. I tried to qualify for income based repayment plans but my co-signer “made too much money” so they said he needed to help with my payments (his income was $100K at the time which doesn’t go far when you have 4 kids to support.... so he didn’t always have extra money to help).

Fast forward a few years and here is the current situation 

Student loans... Wells Fargo in default
- $26K (can settle at 40%)
- $24K (can settle at 40%)
- $20K (settling at 40%— making payments to this on a monthly plan... will be paid off june 2021 and then I’ll start chipping away at the other two)
- $10K Paid - was a charge off 

Student loans... current 
- $14K remaining &amp; account has been current for 3 years.... 10 late payments from 2017... $500/month (10.95% interest rate—Wells Fargo sucks)
- $4,650 remaining in federal loans... never missed a payment... this is in deferment because of COVID. So for the last 6 months I’ve been paying what would have gone to this loan ($150) to my insanely high interest rate WFB loan instead

Other debt/payment history
- $3.9K remaining on auto loan... never missed a payment
- Wells Fargo Platinum card; 7K limit (Utilization sits at about 3% and never over 10%; Paid off every month, perfect pmt history)

All other info
- FICO 655
- Oldest account: 9 years(federal student loan); average age: 7.2 years
- Last late payment was 3 years ago 
- Income $80K 
- $5K emergency fund 
- Recent hard inquiries: 1 in the last two years... was trying to refinance my 1 private student loan with the insane interest rate but was not approved
- I have perfect payment history outside of my student loans

I have about 3-4 more years before these late payments/defaulted loans start falling off of my credit report.

I spend about $700/month on gas/groceries/eating out/house supplies/etc. so I’d like to start getting points for these purchases instead of just the Wells Fargo cash back which gives me $25 every few months. I want to apply for a Chase credit card because of the travel and point benefits but I have noooo idea if they would approve me given the fact that I have student loans in default (even tho I’m paying them off as fast as I can).

- Should I try to apply for the Chase Freedom Unlimited and ask to upgrade in the future to the chase platinum card? Or should I hold off on applying for another year?
- OR; Should I ask for a CL increase on my Wells Fargo Platinum card? (soft credit pull by just answering a few income related q’s)
- Will my score continue to go up as my late payments age? (Obviously there will not be any new late payments)
- Am I always going to get declined for new credit because of my defaulted loans?

personalfinance,Confusion over escrow during closing and the money your old lender sends you,"So this is where I get a little confused with things. 

I often get told when you close on a house / refinance, they set aside X amount meant for escrow in advance, which is rolled into the loan, and a couple weeks later your old lender sends you a check. In an ideal situation, these amounts would be equal and offset each other.  I listened to Dave Ramsey when a called called in and he said ""oh, that isn't lost money, because you are getting it back"". 

Let's say your escrow is $2,000.  So they include $2,000 in the closing costs, thus raising your mortgage amount by $2,000 over the 30 year life of the loan. So even if you get $2,000 back from your old lender, you will still be paying P/I on the $2,000 that was rolled in, right? Even if you get to pocket the $2,000 in cash offset. So its not necessarily a 1:1 trade? 

Is the only true way around this to bring $2,000 cash to the closing to cover escrow, then take the cash the lender gives you 2 weeks later and replenish the cash you had used? 

It's VERY easy, with interest rates below 3% now (my rate is 2.875%) for lenders to easily make you think borrowing money is so cheap why not just do it, but I do want to be smart and responsible about my decisions here.",finance

personalfinance,I regret leaving my remote job for more money,"I work in IT. I have had a consistent full-time stable job since 2017. I was working from home with an hourly wage of $18 (with cheap benefits &amp;amp; matching 401K). However, the workload itself was very stressful due to poor management, inability to prioritize outages, and being constantly understaffed. I found myself literally crying some days to get a new job. 

I got a new corporate 8-5 job but it wouldn’t be remote. However, the pay is $22 with more expensive benefits. The office environment itself is beautiful. The workload is not stressful and I’m finding work enjoyable. However, I pay $150 for transportation costs (gas+train) and I wake up 2 hours earlier since my commute is an hour each way. By the time I get home I don’t feel like doing anything and I can’t see myself doing this for years. 

I miss not needing to pack a lunch, lay out my clothes, commute (especially in the Midwest winter), worry about traffic/delayed trains, or pay for transportation (I spent about $25 a month in gas with a Prius). 

Part of me wanting a better job with more money and amenities was not worth leaving a lesser paying job but allowed me to work from home. I got so spoiled with working remotely that I am having a difficult time adjusting still and I don’t know if it will ever improve or how people do it.

To anyone considering it, convenience is definitely worth taking less pay.

personalfinance,Transferring schools while having fedloans tanked my credit score.,"Hello,

I wanted to know if I could do anything to improve my credit score to what it use to be. 

Context:

This is in the US. I was transferring universities in 2018-2019 so there was a 11 month period where I didn't have any classes. What I found out later was that if you aren't a full time student for 9 months you have to start paying off your fedloans. Since I was not a student for 11 months, there was 2 months where I had payments due for 7 different fedloans at the time so I missed 14 payments which ended up tanking my credit score mid-2019.

I would understand if it was just two late payments or something but I didn't know about the 9 month grace period which is my fault. And late last year when I checked my credit score, I saw that it dipped cause of this. So I wanted to know if it is possible to do anything to fix this or remove the late payments? Currently all 7 of the fedloans are current and after I missed two payments for each they all became current and have been ever since.

financialindependence,Nearing FIRE w/ $2.6M NW at age 33 – My journey &amp; thoughts,"**TLDR:** Here’s goes my first ever post on Reddit: Just hit $2.6M net worth at age 33 after discovering I was working towards FIRE without knowing what it was until stumbling across it online last year. Wife doesn’t care, but wanted to tell someone. My story, lessons learned, &amp; how FIRE changed my strategy.

**Reasons for FIRE:** I’ve worked from home for a tech company for 13 years (Support Delivery)  Unlike many people on this sub, I actually love my job, and would do it forever, but know I got incredible lucky and don’t know how I’ve lasted this long already with the BS corporate performance cycle, quotas, etc.  My skillset is not transferrable, so if/when they fire me, I’d likely be starting at the ground-level at another company making little $, and probably not working from home, so I decided that when that days comes, I want to be ready.   In a way I see it as being a ""good steward"" so to speak of the hand and luck that I was dealt, and I want to make sure I'm not squandering that by pissing it away on things that don't matter.   Curious if anyone else is in the same boat with why they're pursuing FIRE?

I’m a bit of a lone wolf with how I live life, so when I stumbled across the FIRE movement online last year, I was excited to find the formal framework for what I had been pursuing on my own for years. I had never heard of the 4% rule, and didn’t even think about stocks as a viable option for early retirement, so my focus had been on buy-&amp;-hold rentals, which after managing 7 myself, although almost no work when counted in hours, started becoming more *stressful* than I liked.

This sub, along with the blogs like MMM, changed my approach and for the past year, I’ve been slowly changing my focus on simplifying my investments, stopped buying homes and started dumping excess income into VTI instead, and even sold my first rental this year.

**Income:** Started at $48k in 2007, now $160k + $70k profit from 7 rentals mostly owned with cash.

**Spending:** My current savings rate is 87%. I spend only $26k / year somehow but feel I live luxuriously. I own 2 cars, dirt bikes, ATVs (all Hondas), and spend plenty of time each year vacationing overseas. My #1 expense is travel, and some trips I figure out a way to get the owner of our side-gig (performing arts) to pay for as long as we perform or teach while there (while also making the trip partially tax deductible too). [Link to my current spending / income / savings rate chart](https://i.imgur.com/BKAGvgF.jpg)

**Investments:** [Link to my mint.com entire NW summary](https://i.imgur.com/xvTLC6P.jpg)

* **$1.35M** – paid off real estate (now 7 total homes, $1.6M minus $367k in mortgages), includes my personal $300k house. Average ROI for my rentals is 14% w/ just rents, 39% if capital appreciation is factored in. It’s lower because most of them are paid off, so less leverage. [(Screenshot of Rental ROI Details)](https://i.imgur.com/waVzvqy.jpg)  I used my HELOC to pay ""cash"" for homes, then aggressively paid it down and repeated.  Was probably risky, but it's paid off now, and is my ""E-fund"" now.
* **$500k** – Taxable (VTI / VXUS) – M1Finance [(Screenshot)](https://i.imgur.com/bYFuyXi.jpg) Their automation is awesome btw
* **$220k** – Taxable in my company’s stock, acquired through ESPP. Yes I want to move this to VTI, but $130k is gains, so don’t know how to without a huge tax bill.  Any ideas?
* **$345k** – 401k maxed out [(Screenshot)](https://i.imgur.com/3vMwfQk.jpg) (Russel 3000, the best options I could find)
* **$96k** – Other (HSA maxed out, joint SoFi account w/ wife, Prosper.com, 24k cash, etc)

**Taxes:** Federal taxes paid is $16k / year. Real estate helps a lot here, plus our side gig which turns many expenses, hobbies, &amp; travel I'd pay anyway into deductions.

**Marriage:** I’m married, but we keep our finances separate, so all these numbers are my own. We both contribute an equal amount into a small joint checking for things like groceries &amp; utilities. I’ve shared with her my net worth when I crossed $2.0M, but she didn’t seem to care much.

**Family Life:** No help from family, at all... I actually ran away from home as a minor and never went back.  I took the GED and started college at age 15, graduated at 19.  I think pushing the ""youngest to graduate blah blah"" narrative hard with the college recruiters definitely helped me land the tech job, not because I was particularly skilled.  I've been working full time since age 16.

**Current Plan:**

* Ride this job out as long as I can without getting fired in spite waning motivation and struggling with work performance.  Enjoy the freedom of working from ""home"", wherever home is that day.
* Continue simplifying finances. Sell 220k of company stock somehow. Want to also sell a few more homes eventually and put that $ in the stock market. I wouldn’t mind keeping a few long term if I don’t have another job to give me something to do.  Dreading the capital gains bill from all this.

**Thoughts &amp; Reflections:**

* My philosophy in life (FIRE, taxes, politics, money) has been ""tell me what the rules of the game are, and I'll figure out how to win"".  I see so many people whining how they can never succeed in the current ""system"" (thankfully not so much on this sub), when in reality, no one is going to come along and change the rules for you personally so you can succeed.  It's your job to win given the current system the best we can.
* I bought my houses in 2013–2018, when prices were still near the bottom after the recession. I realize this was just luck, and don’t intend to keep pushing that luck or think that is a repeatable format. No regrets, I just got very lucky.
* Keep maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, something I didn't start doing until discovering FIRE.
* I had dumped a bunch of money in cryptos over the last couple years. Finally pulled the plug and got out with big losses. They're right, the pain of seeing losses is way worse than gains. Oh well.
* This year I finally sold all my hard gold and silver that I've owned since 1999.  Yes, it was in preparation for Y2K.  Also yes, I was just a 13 year old child (but a very prepared child!)
* Focus on choosing a career path that maximizes income first in any way possible. That's far more important than cutting $20 off your cell phone bill.  This should be the 1st step to FIRE.
* IMO, doing “something you love” isn’t as glamorous as it sounds. I went to college for art, and realized that although it seemed “fun”, it doesn't pay, and there’s no quicker way to kill a fun hobby than having to do it for a living. Also, I’d rather work a fraction my life at a desk job than my whole life doing something I thought sounded cool at age 20. If the 8-5 desk job doesn’t sound fun, focus on what makes decent money that you COULD still find enjoyable. There’s more options you could enjoy than you realize. Instead of just focusing on “what sounds fun to ME”, focus on “what does the world need more of”, or “what's in high demand in my community that I’d enjoy somewhat at least”. The money often follows that.
* In the beginning I was focused on maximizing returns, which is why I chose rentals. Average work is only a 1-2 hours / week, BUT, I’ve realized I hate the stress. E.g. recent text from tenant: “Sent my brother to check on house, he got stabbed by squatters, is in hospital”. …talk about a way to ruin a weekend (well, more like 4 months, squatters are no joke). Now that I have higher net worth &amp; more money “working for me”, I don’t mind sacrificing return % for peace of mind.
* Don’t turn down living your best life today. There are tons of opportunities, trips, etc that seemed like they cost a lot of money at the time, but turned out to some of my best memories that I would never give up, even if I missed out on compounding gains as a result. Say yes to the parts of life that come along that excite you, and don’t put if off until retirement, since these are what make life worth living, not your net worth $.  I often think “if I died today, would I have regrets having focused on savings so much”? Find that balance &amp; slash the stuff that doesn’t matter.  For us, that’s kids, big house, alcohol, nice hotels, wedding, any status symbols, etc).

As you can see, I'm an open book, so I'm open to any thoughts, questions, or advice on anything I may be overlooking or doing wrong.",finance
personalfinance,Emergency fund vs. investment money,"My financial situation has changed significantly recently and I'd like to ask advice on the best course of action with the money I have newly available to me.

Job situation:  today was my first day back at work after six months' COVID furlough.  Between paid leave, unused PTO, state unemployment and federal stimulus, I've been absolutely flush for the last six months. I've been privileged enough during the Covid downturn that I was able to pay off a credit card, as well as a significant medical debt.  Now that I'm back to work (without government benefits) I'm looking at saving-versus-investing for the first time in my professional life, with the income I have left over now that the government money is gone.

Current situation includes the following details:

 * Age: 46

 * Current household income (wife and I are both employed) is barely into the six-figure range.

 * Two mortgages, with about $85K balance between them

 * Other debt includes two credit cards with zero balance (yay!), and I'm an authorized user on my wife's credit card that she uses for work (about $4k continuing balance.)  We also have a car loan with just over $4k left on the principal, and about 18 months left on the term.

 * Wife and I divide the household bills -- I pay first mortgage and utilities, she pays second mortgage, car loan, and the other minor bills (including her own work-related credit card.)

 * Both of us also have retirement accounts. My 401k-plus-Roth account through my employer is currently sitting in the $130k range.  Not quite where I want it to be, but it could be a lot worse.

This leaves me with about $500 a month in money available to an emergency fund (which I've already partially used for a furnace repair. I loved not having to charge that.)  I'd like to start investing part of that to fill out the gap in my retirement funds.

Basically, as a first-time investor (not counting 401k), I need beginner's guidance on how much is appropriate to invest, and where to do it, besides sticking some money for immediate emergencies that will always come up.  Major goal here includes saving for my 12-year-old daughter's eventual college fund.  (Daughter is brilliant and will undoubtably earn scholarships out the wazoo, but I don't want to depend on that as a given.)",finance

personalfinance,Leaving an IRA to be escheated to the state can now cost you significantly.,"In the past it wasn’t a big deal to leave small IRA’s open. It’s not the best idea, but now it’s a terrible idea: 

\&gt;Unclaimed property holders should take notice of IRS rules concerning the escheatment of individual retirement accounts effective Jan. 1, 2020. In Revenue Ruling 2018-17, the IRS ruled that the escheatment of an IRA or annuity to a state unclaimed property fund will be subject to federal tax withholding and reporting. In other words, escheatment will be treated as a designated distribution to the IRA owner subject to withholding at a 10% rate. This assumes there is no withholding election by the IRA owner. 

I am not affiliated with this agency, but their summary is very clear. I would hate to see someone pay this withholding for no reason.

The other is 2.875% interest with no origination fee, and totals $103.6k.

stocks,"PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, September 28, 2020","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, September 28, 2020**

Stocks jumped today as the major indices looked to recuperate some of their losses from the past weeks. Global equities also jumped after China reported strong industrial profit figures.

The financials, industrials and materials sectors led gains in the S&amp;P 500, though all 11 major sectors were positive on the day. Big Tech shares jumped, recovering some of the decline from the past weeks. The Nasdaq (QQQ) led, finishing 2.08% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.68% up and the Dow (DIA) finished the day 1.56% up.

Covid-19 cases are on the rise in the United States as more states reopen and loosen restrictions put in place earlier in the year. According to data from John Hopkins, the US recorded 55,759 new cases on Friday, the highest single day total in about a month. Forty states and territories have seen an increase over the last two weeks as of Saturday, just days after the U.S. logged its 7 millionth confirmed coronavirus case. Wyoming was the nation’s new hot spot with a 128 percent jump in new cases followed by Utah (111 percent), Wisconsin (104 percent) and Colorado (97 percent), based on data compiled by NBC. Gov Tony Evers declared a public health emergency in Wisconsin in response to the uptick.

Dr. Fauci, the US’ leading infectious disease expert and leader in fighting the virus, said “We \[the US\] are not in a good place. There are states that are starting to show an uptick in cases and even some increases in hospitalization in some states.” He added that the average of 40,000 new cases per day is “unacceptably high” and that he would like to see it below 10,000.

This morning China reported a 19.1% surge in industrial profits in August, marking the fourth straight month of sustained recovery. The report raised hopes that the slump in the global economy this year may not be as bad as originally feared, as the country first hit by the pandemic continues to recover.

Hopes for the passage of additional stimulus was raised after Pelosi told CNN that democrats would soon unveil a new $2.4 trillion proposal, roughly $1 trillion less than their initial proposal but a figure still higher than the reported $1.5 trillion figure that the Trump administration has signaled it will accept. In response Pelosi said, “At some point, the public is going to have to see why $2.2 or now $2.4 trillion dollars is necessary. The president’s denial of the virus and just resistance to doing anything to crush it has made matters worse ... So we may need more money than that. And we will reveal what that is in a short period of time.” Treasury Secretary Mnuchin added that he and Pelosi have agreed to restart talks to try to work out a deal.

On Sunday, President Trump officially nominated Amy Coney Barret to the Supreme Court to replace Former Justice Ginsburg’s seat. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, suggesting they could move quickly to confirm her before the November election, despite the cry of Democratic lawmakers.

personalfinance,"I want to refinance my mortgage, but I don't know how","Hi /r/personalfinance,

I've lurked for a while and am looking to refinance my mortgage but I feel kind of overwhelmed at how to start the process.  I've heard that interest rates are at historic lows and should remain there for a while, so nows the time to pull the trigger I guess.  I searched this subreddit and saw some people suggested to use Credible or Aimloan to refinance, but I'm feeling anxious about going forward with the process.  Details on my loan:

* 4.375% interest rate 30 year
* Principle, Interest, Escrow/Property Tax = $1438/mo 
* Owned by Nation Star / USAA
* VA Loan
* 232k remaining (very little paid in principle due to age of loan and $0 down)
* \~115k household income (a lot of it is tax free)

I have only had this place for 1.5 years.  I'm military and had a ""surprise"" PCS to a new place and just went to USAA because they made the VA loan process easy but I feel like the rate is pretty high.  I've seen people getting 30 year mortgages in the mid 2% range and would love to see if I could do the same.  My only worries though are if I refinance, will it retain the VA loan status?  I don't like the idea of having to pay mortgage insurance.  Should I be aiming for points or no points? I don't quite understand this.  How much would be acceptable in closing costs?  Are there loan companies I should stay away from?  I'm sure there are a lot of other questions I should be asking but I really don't know what I'm doing here.  Anyway, any help would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Best way to find lowest refinancing rates?,Just curious how some of you are able to find really low interest rates? I’ve been looking at 30 year mortgage. I bought my house in 2018 and already refinanced once earlier this year from 4.38% to 3.5%. My house went up in value by a lot so i didn’t need to get an assessment. I’ve paying my old pre-refinanced payment so I’m now at the point where i can drop PMI but need an appraisal done. So i figured i could look into refinancing again since rates are stupid low. I’m hoping to find something closer to 2.5%. But everywhere online I’m finding very high closing costs (like $10k).,finance
personalfinance,"Got a ""deal"" to refinance my mortgage due to ""rapidly evolving circumstances and challenges"". I know it is too good to be true, but I think the discussion here will benefit others.","My original mortgage lender sold our loan to another holder - which, to my understanding, if quite common. 

I got a letter in the mail today referencing my original lender, but the loan would be transferred to ""United Finance Corp"" if I accept the offer and go through it.  I am 5 years into my 30 year loan @ 3.25%

They are offering 2 months of no payments OR $25k Cash Out option, reduction of my interest rate from 3.25 to 2.5 (2.943 APR) with an estimated monthly payment of $2300/month - roughly $1k less than what I currently pay including PMI.

My understanding of these kind of deals is that the time, money and steps to obtain at least the lower interest rate is not worth it as the true monthly payments will most likely be insignificant.

I work in a very stable company and industry, so the pandemic actually boosted business for my company and very well compensated.

While refinancing for a lower interest rate based on just completing 5 of 30 years on the loan is enticing, this is not the offer that I should take.

My initial thought before this letter was to refinance at a much lower rate, but my house has gone up in value by roughly 21%.

Am I wrong in thinking this is a wash of a deal or actually NOT a good deal?

What advice would other people benefit from getting letters like this?",finance

personalfinance,Buyers Remorse and Massive Anxiety Issues,"It’s my first car, and I’m freaking out. I’ve only had it 12 days and I’m starting to think I made a mistake. I had an 09 Honda CR-V but was in an accident and it was totaled. I shopped around and found a 2018 4 cyclinder GMC Terrain SLE with 13K miles on it. Initially I loved it because I thought it had more space than my Honda, and I’m starting to realize it doesn’t. The biggest thing for me when looking at cars was the amount of space. I just wanted more than my Honda and it’s actually less. Unfortunately, had there been a 2017 GMC it would’ve been fine but I guess gmc updated the terrains and now they have less space. I made the mistake of comparing the specs online and it does in fact have less space than my old car. Otherwise it’s perfect but I recently found a 2020 Honda Pilot (which is/was my dream car) and it has 5K miles on it and I’m seriously considering seeing if I can trade this in or something. I’m freaking out about this my family wasn’t at all helpful in the cars search if anything they added more stress. When all the seats are down there’s enough space but when the seats are up there’s hardly trunk room and I cannot figure out how to move the backseats up. It’s great on gas which was another major thing but my anxiety over the lack of amount space is destroying me especially since I found my dream car. Yes, I probably should’ve waited a little bit longer but due to my job and the fact I was starting another (6a-2p &amp; 2:30p-11:15p are the hours I work) in the morning I needed a car as soon as possible. I keep trying to tell myself that everything else about the car is fine but the amount of space was literally the make or break moment for a car. I haven’t gotten the title or anything and my loan is thru Huntington bank. I have really good credit and the interest rate is 6.0% and idk what trading in a car so soon would do to that, or how that would affect the loan. I put 8800 down that I wouldn’t get back, If i traded it in (or would I) I can’t ask my family for help or advice because even though I’m the one that’s making the payments and I don’t have a co-signer on it they disapproved of me buying this car, not because it was bad but because they would’ve preferred me to get a sedan (which I hate). I don’t know what to do. Everything was fine until I got the nagging suspicion about it having LESS space than I had before. I can’t get this issue out of my head. Can someone please help me or give me advice. I’m literally in the middle of an anxiety attack. 

Edit: I’m 21 if that matters and I was planning on calling the dealership I bought the car from and another car salesman I know to get some advice as well. I’m in the US if that matters",finance

In case you still have the old 1.2 Flipstarter plugin, download the latest [here](https://gitlab.com/flipstarter/flipstarter-electron-cash/-/releases)

Why you should contribute to James' campaign:

1. Validation improvement: If you've used EC-SLP, you know validation can be slow, whether you use brute-force-get-your-whole-DAG-from-EC-server (intolerable for busy tokens), or Graph Search (better, still not great at all). Optional federated validation can vastly improve this with just a bit of tradeoff in trustlessness.

2. Local rewards toolbox: Issue dividends and rewards to tokenholders, all from the comfort of your desktop, no going to a website and bombarding the REST server (with possible downtime) anymore, _and_ with improved algorithm to efficiently reward way more holders! IMO the ability to drop BCH/token rewards to tokenholders is one of the greatest usecases SLP offers - and is where it shines through the BCH ecosystem. Worth supporting for this alone.

3. Tutorial series: Want users? This is how you get users, can't just tell people ""oh but BCH has _tokens_"" and leave them at that. Gotta show them.

4. James has been instrumental in founding and establishing basically everything about the Simple Ledger Protocol. You _want_ this guy to keep working on it.

Considering the [potential](https://blog.imaginary.cash/index.php/trustless-token-collateralized-bitcoin-cash-loans/) [benefits](https://memo.cash/tokens) of the SLP protocol to BCH as a whole, I think it's well worth it to see this funded even for people who care little for tokens.

I'm asking because if I buy a mature, competitive company like apple for example, if I plan to purchase the company outright and hold onto it for 10 years, should I not factor that I can resell the company in 10 years?

This is my thought process. If there is a shoe company that makes $100,000 a year for the last 100 years, and we assume they will continue to make $100,000 a year, if I were to buy the company I would make $1,000,000 over the course of 10 years. And lets say we determine based off current interest rates, risks, etc. The appropriate discount rate is 10 percent. Then my present value is $385,000. But... in theory, if all holds equal (interest rates, competition etc) I should be able to sell my company to someone else, even if its at a steep markdown. So should I not add a sales price to my $1,000,000 and get a higher pv?

The only apposing argument I can think of is that we are making a very bold assumption that someone else would be willing to pay for the company (not to mention the inherent difficulty in determining what someone else would be willing to pay). But again, assuming nothing changes over the next 10 years, I don't see why an investor wouldn't pay even something small for a company like apple. Am I missing something?",finance

investing,This is my newest compilation of five CHEAP stocks possibly worth your attention #CAG #FSS #HWKN #MGIC #SNDR,"**This post was inspired by you - some of you wanted to see cheap alternatives to popular, expensive stocks**

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a couple of CHEAP (priced below $50) stocks that might be worth your attention this week. This short list was compiled with help of various sources of data, including Buy recommendations from several renowned stock data providers and analytical services. This is why I'm calling the approach a **consensus strategy.** The stocks I'm going to present you below are generally believed to outperform the stock market in the coming months, they have a consensus recommendation of Buy, their fundamentals are scored considerably better than most stocks and their average target price by stock analysts is above current market valuation.

In order to consider buying the stock's shares, the following criteria need to be satisfied:

* **TheStreet score**: A+, A or A- (Strong Buys)
* **Yahoo Finance recommendation**: at least mixed Buy/Hold
* **MarketBeat recommendation**: at least mixed Buy/Hold
* **Yahoo Finance target price**: min. 5% higher than current price
* **Piotroski F-Score**: min. 4
* **Moody's Daily Credit Risk**: 1 to 6
* **InvestorsObserver Overall Score**: min. 50  


**Notes**:

* Descriptions of those criteria are provided at the end of this post.
* The criteria used here are less restrictive than those I'm using in general, without requirement taht the stock price is below $50. This is because cheap stocks tend to have weaker fundamentals and, typically, are less favored by stock experts

&amp;#x200B;

If you decide to buy any of the below stocks, you might want to consider the following selling conditions (at least one of them should be satisfied):

* price is higher or close to target
* profit is in range 20% - 30%
* loss is higher than 50%
* TheStreet recommendation is changed to Sell
* Yahoo Finance recommendation is changed to Sell

&amp;#x200B;

###### Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**3. MarketBeat recommendation**

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold.

**4. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

**5. Moody's Daily Credit Risk**

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

&amp;#x200B;

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

personalfinance,Recently sold my business and want to best understand how to maximize returns outside of a savings account. (US),"My wife and I recently came into some extra cash (~$4M) and we are trying to best understand how to invest for greater returns with limited risk.

We both work and have a combined income of around 300k annual. We recently purchased a home with ~3% interest rate and owe ~$1M on the home. We're not sure if we should look to pay off some of the interest or try to take that cash and see a greater return elsewhere.

We spoke to a financial advisor at JP Morgan and he is interested in investing across a series of Equitys and Bonds. However they will charge a 0.75% advisory fee.

We are looking at about 40% combined federal and state taxes on top of the 4M. Any advice on how to minimize this if possible.

My previous investment experience has been toying around and buying a few tech stocks here and there but nothing significant as I tend to be risk adverse and don't have the time to watch the market daily &amp; move money around to maximize returns.

gaming,Gamestop issues,"Update: Friend just informed me once again they did not call back as promised after 4 hours

My friend was unable to post his experience over the last two months due to being new to reddit so I will be posting on his behalf about this absolutely ridiculous situation. U/comprehensive_hat_30 is his reddit (tried posting to the gamestop reddit but it was quickly deleted)

hello everyone and gamestop, i just wanted to post on here a experience i have been going through the last...2 months and boy, what a disaster. i purchased a extended warranty for a xbox one s white 1TB console back in january, 2020 well the system started acting up and not working right, i call gamestop corporate office and i asked them how they would be handling the situation, i was told to go to a local gamestop and they'd handle the situation for me

i went to my local gamestop and brought in my xbox, the box, controller and all of the packaging as well as the little sticker that states you bought an extended warranty, the store did a ""special system request"" and i was told it was on its way...after about a week or so i call the store to check up on the situation and i'm told ""we have no idea, we don't know when we are getting xbox's""

so i call up corporate office and after going through 3-4 people because they didn't want to do their job.. i talk to a girl who emails me a shipping label and tell's me to ""send my system in and if they couldn't replace it, i'd get a refund, so i get the label and i send my console to gamestop to be replaced.

After a good month or so i never recieved my system, i call the corporate number back just to get the response of ""we didn't have your address to send the console back"" so i update my information and she then tells me that i'd be getting a email with the shipping label, after about a week i never got a email or anything, i call the corporate office back and after dealing with 3-4 people i finally get to someone who tell's me that they have to request a system replacement and they had to do the whole situation ALL OVER AGAIN.

FINALLY after today after being on hold for nearly a hour (52 minutes to be exact) the supervisor had me threeway call a local gamestop? in which the store manager was CLUELESS as to what to do, he needed my information i guess? i have no idea but LASTLY he says he can't get any further information and he will call me back in 4 hours, which... 2 weeks ago i was told i'd get a call back and never recieved one.

i made this post mainly because after my horrid experience, i am just lost for words... i am completely just speechless that a actual company could be like this? what a NIGHTMARE of a experience and ITS NOT EVEN OVER YET, i am STILL without my console and i STILL get the ""we messed up, we are sorry"" BUT thats supposed to make everything OKAY? good lord gamestop""


Id also like to include my personal experience in this post as well. Towards the middle of the ps3 life cycle I purchased a used ps3 brought it home played for 2 hours before I started having issues took it back and got a replacement only for this ps3 to start acting up. I then took it back and got a third used ps3. Finally this one works. Fast forward to the ps4 same damn thing buy a used ps4 have to take it back twice before one of the employees starts giving me a hard time. At this point im fed up and just tell them i want to return the used console and buy a brand new one. 

Between my experience and my friends experience Im completely done with gamestop. And my friend now has to wait 4 hours to even hope to get a call back from this gamestop rep.",technology

My job's contract is ending this year, so I decided to retire in my mid 40's on Jan 2021. I have 2.8mil net worth, of which 2.5 mill is in investments. I plan to control my AGI to be 50k per year, but my family lives off of less than 40k normally. I'll be using a Roth conversion ladder to live off my IRA and taxable investments.

I'm being offered a severance package of 100k all paid in 2021. Unfortunately, the company doesn't allow me to make any 401k contributions with the severance. I plan on putting 12k into deductible IRAs to lower my AGI, so with a family of 5 that leaves me owing 2.2k in Fed and 4.8k in State taxes. Since I don't need that whole 100k, is there any other strategy to lower that AGI that I may be missing?

Would you finance wizards have any advice on dealing with the package? Also any advice on dealing with HR on this would be appreciated.

Here's my investment values the last 10 years for those interested. I did not start tracking it well till recently:

2010 - $486k

stocks,"Disney to lay off 28,000 employees as coronavirus slams its theme park business","Prolonged closures at [Disney’s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=DIS) California-based theme parks and limited attendance at its open parks has forced the company to lay off 28,000 employees across its parks, experiences and consumer products division.

In a letter sent to employees on Tuesday, Josh D’Amaro, head of parks at Disney, detailed several “difficult decisions” the company has had to make in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, including ending its furlough of thousands of employees.

Shares of the company fell less than 2% after the closing bell on Tuesday.

Around 67% of the 28,000 laid off workers were part-time employees, according to D’Amaro. The company declined to break down the layoffs by individual park locations.

While Disney’s theme parks in Florida, Paris, Shanghai, Japan and Hong Kong have been able to reopen with limited capacity, both California Adventure and Disneyland have remained shuttered in Anaheim, California.

“As you can imagine, a decision of this magnitude is not easy,” D’Amaro wrote in the letter obtained by CNBC. “For the last several months, our management team has worked tirelessly to avoid having to separate anyone from the company. We’ve cut expenses, suspended capital projects, furloughed our cast members while still paying benefits, and modified our operations to run as efficiently as possible, however, we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while operating at such limited capacity.”

The parks, experiences and consumer products segment is a vitally important part of Disney’s business. Last year, it accounted for 37% of the company’s $69.6 billion in total revenue.

CryptoCurrency,Do you still trust Coinmarketcap?,"I have used CMC a lot on and off since 2015. When I saw Ethereum for the first time &lt;$1 and said, ""what the hell is Ethereum?"" I was looking at its price on CMC.

It used to be an excellent, lightweight, simplistic list of coins that were actually sorted by market cap. That's what made it popular in the first place. Over time, however, it began to change. It got more bloated. Slower. It seems to have gotten much worse more recently.

Additionally, more rules were imposed so that many coins with unusually high market caps began showing up on page 4 or 100+ rankings lower than they really belong in terms of market cap. Volume from certain exchanges are excluded at random. They say they do this for ethical reasons, but they're also pretty eager to shill PnD DeFi food tokens and the selective bias there is just gross.

One of my holdings is in a lesser-known (XSN) and I swear CMC breaks it's ranking in some new way every week. It doesn't even come up when you search for it anymore. At some point, it became ""ineligible for regular ranking"" because CMC considered it one CEX ""short"" of a good spread. That brought it's ranking down considerably. Then it got listed on a US-regulated exchange that prides itself on having zero wash trading. All good right? Lolno. Now CMC decided to exclude the volume on it's most popular exchange and its US-regulated one as ""outliers"". They deemed it's least popular exchange where gets almost no volume as legit, though.

Am I daft for insinuating that Binance spent $400 million on CMC to slowly make it their ""top 100 favorite coins"" list (a 'coinsifeelrankhigherthanothersfornoparticularreasoncap', if you will) and censor smaller projects and competitors that didn't pay to play under the guise of ""ethics""? Forgive the plug here, but it's no coincidence that XSN has been building a layer 2 DEX since 2018 and serves as a potential competitor to Binance. It's also no coincidence that the XSN team built all throughout the bear market on no ICO, taking no breaks, and yet they get near-zero industrial recognition for their breakthroughs. All the industrial titans instead hop on ""BUIDLing"" ill-fated ICO tokens that just got started in the past few weeks in direct response to defi hype money.

But enough about that...

As far as I see it, they can insist on filtering out erratics in a futile effort to save crypto investors from themselves (it doesn't) for ""ethical reasons"" OR they can shill them erratic garbage that will be forgotten in a few weeks, but they can't do both. I think we can all agree on this, at least.

All that said, I use Coingecko a lot more now because it seems to be closer to what CMC was a few years ago but I still occasionally use CMC as charts can differ. Let me know if you disagree, or if you know of any other decent projects that got stiffed for not bribing the gatekeepers.",cryptocurrency

investing,Sovereign CDS Market: The Role of Dealers in Credit Events,"Posting this fully aware that most people will not read it, still it's quite interesting that research shows a very different CDS environment then one would think given popular sentiment. 


Full paper: https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2020/q3/sultanum.pdf

&gt;As a result of their role in the 2008 financial crisis and in the sovereign debt crises in Europe, credit default swaps are among the most
controversial derivative instruments. In both corporate and sovereign
contexts, proponents of CDS attest to their beneficial effects in providing and transferring liquidity risk during times of distress.


&gt;Critics view CDS as speculative bets, especially since CDS holders
may hold more CDS than bonds with respect to the reference entity.
That is, if a party owns equal amounts of bonds and CDS for a particular reference entity, then the party is completely insured against a
negative credit event. In this way, a CDS works pretty much like an
insurance policy on a car, house, or any other asset. However, unlike
insurance, it is possible to own more CDS protection than the underlying bonds. As a result, CDS contracts make it possible to trade on a reference entity ís credit risk without having any exposure to the underlying credit, which can be interpreted as a bet on the deterioration
of the reference entity ís ability to repay its creditors.


&gt;In the sovereign CDS market, the reference entity is a country; as
a result, increases in default risk could have significant economic impact and ethical considerations. Since CDS markets tend to be more
liquid and larger than the corresponding bond market, some academics
and members of the media have argued that speculative bets from
large traders can artificially drive the price of a CDS contract up. In
turn, market participants observe the risk of the underlying bonds to
be higher than it actually is, increasing the cost of borrowing for the
distressed countries. Thus, this increases the chances of default artificially. In this scenario, buying CDS is functionally equivalent to short
selling the bonds. Short selling bonds is nearly impossible due to the
lack of liquidity in bond markets; as a result, the presence of a CDS
contract allows the sovereign bond ís pessimists and optimists to enter
the market, increasing price stability of the underlying bond.


/


&gt;Figure 4, which is extracted from Chaumont et al. (2020), displays the
relationship between average yield and average dealer position aggregated by country from 2013ñ18. There is a downward trend in Figure
Sultanum et al.: Sovereign CDS Market: The Role of Dealers with a correlation coefficient of -0.2. That is, the average dealer CDS
position decreases as a country ís average risk increases. This mirrors
our conclusions from the three case studies above, where we find that
the dealer CDS position decreases as risk increases within each country. To the extent that the cross-country relationship is indicative of
the intracountry relationship, this is evidence that our conclusion from
these case studies generally applies to other countries. Nonetheless, one
could be concerned that within each country represented in Figure 4,
dealer positions do not decrease as risk increases. Perhaps the inverse
relationship only holds when a country is significantly distressed.


&gt;Chaumont et al. (2020) address these concerns by using more rigorous empirical speciÖcations to determine the relationship between risk and dealer position. By controlling for country, dealer, and time-fixed
effects, they determine the relationship between risk and dealer position within each country. Non distressed and distressed countries are
also included in the sample; as a result, they are able to determine
if the effect found in this paper is only true in distressed countries.
In several specifications and robustness checks, they find that as risk
increases (decreases), dealer CDS positions decrease (increase) within
112 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly
each country regardless of risk. This is the same conclusion found in
the case studies above.


&gt;Chaumont et al. (2020) also propose a formal model aimed at tying
the changes in CDS position to bond market stability and liquidity,
which is assumed in this paper. Combined with the empirical results
in this paper, their model would suggest that the existence of sovereign
CDS markets is benefcial to borrowers and lowers the cost of borrowing
for countries.

investing,October reports: Ones that will exceed expectations,"Lots of companies releasing quarterly reports in october. With covid making financial harder to predict, who do you think will exceed expectations?

Im very sure UPS will have earnings significantly higher than projections. They have benefitted greatly from the pandemic and nothing the past quarter will have slowed that momentum. Fedex completely beat their expectations and I looking at UPS estimated earnings, looks to me like their moment has not been fully priced in yet.

Everything Amazon does benefits covid. Cloud, online shopping and streaming. Their projected eps is a good amount lower than previous quarter and I cant think of anything justifying such a decrease.

Semiconductor I find hard to analyze. Intel i am curious about. Their biggest revenue sources about 40% comes from Dell Lenovo and HP which have all had a good rally since the crash. Market is way too bearish on intel so the bar is set low. 

Tesla: I have no idea. Cannot wrap my head around them, too unpredictable. Hopefully they underperform so i can buy them cheap for long term.

personalfinance,Overload Student Loans or Keep Brokerage Account?,"I graduated college recently and  have $163,000 in student loans (yikes) with an average interest rate of 6.62%. I'll make ~$80,000 this year, and my company does yearly raises anywhere from 4-8%, in a very stable industry with minimal worry of losing employment, so everything is looking up in that sense. I moved out of my parents home a couple months after graduating and  my current monthly expenses (rent, utilities, food) total about $1200. Due to Covid my job will now be entirely remote and I plan to move back in with my parents when my lease expires in June, so that will be eliminated. I contribute 6% to my 401k monthly (employer matches half of contribution up to 6%). I have a separate personal brokerage account with $27,000, and personal savings of $8,000. My dilemma right now is if I should funnel my entire brokerage account into my student loans. I'm thinking it would be a good idea to do it, then refinance my loans around the time I move back in with my parents. I'm 23 years old so I have a good amount of time to overload my loans now for 2 or so years then begin saving for a down payment on a house once my monthly payment is decreased. Should I empty the brokerage account into my loans? Should I refinance sooner or later? Should I focus on growing my savings or put all extra money into loan payments?

personalfinance,Step 4(b) - Deductions Worksheet....how does the itemized deduction estimate effect everything?,"I received an offer letter for a new job that I plan to accept. Part of the new hire documents I'm supposed to sign includes some usual tax stuff. On the W4 Form page 3 exists the Step 4(b) for deductions. I purchased a duplex earlier this year and am living in one half of a multi-family building, and that most likely will lead me to itemize for the first time as opposed to taking the standard deduction.

After many hours of research the previous few months on everything tax-related when it comes to real estate, I still feel like a total noob who will resort to using TurboTax premium next year for the state and federal filings (I've used the basic version of TT the previous few years). But what I'm concerned about here for this Step 4(b) is that I don't have enough knowledge to put an accurate estimation for the 2020 itemized deduction amount. The first field in that sections says:

&gt;Enter an estimate of your 2020 itemized deductions (from Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR)). Such deductions may include qualifying home mortgage interest, charitable contributions, state and local taxes (up to $10,000), and medical expenses in excess of 7.5% of your income

Before reading that, I didn't even know state taxes could be itemized when choosing the itemized deduction. And I'm sure there are other things I won't know about being able to deduct until February of next year. The question I'm curious about here is, what consequences will an underestimation of this itemized deduction amount have when it becomes tax time next year? I'm minimally competent enough to understand that the less I state that I'll deduct, the more my employer will withhold from my paychecks for tax purposes, which would lead to a higher refund amount next year compared to if the estimation was somehow 100% accurate. Meaning I'm essentially letting the government gradually hold on to more of my money until I file the return. But is there anything else besides that?",finance
personalfinance,Home Buying and/or Retirement: How Should I Be Using My Money Right Now?,"Basically what the title is asking. My financial situation detailed below. 

I know I should be saving for retirement, especially because I just started seriously contributing to IRAs and my 401K around 30 years old. However, I'm afraid housing prices are just going to keep going up, inflation is going through the roof lately (?), and I won't be able to save up a downpayment in the future. I'm currently at 3k in my 401k (and already maxed out my Roth IRA) for 2020, and I'm planning on living off my 18k in savings, while I throw my remaining salary for the year into my 401k (hopefully maxing it out too). At the beginning of next year, I plan to first contribute my employer's 401k match while maxing out my IRA, and then maxing out my 401k again. Invest early as they say.

On the other hand, we are at a historical low for interest rates. I live in OR and would like to live in the NW (also considering WA, MT, or ID potentially) for the foreseeable future, but I'm not exactly desperate to move into my own house necessarily. It just seems like a great time to buy a place due to my credit score and the interest rates. I know mortgage payments aren't the only expense, but I'll either be paying rent or putting the money towards a house while hopefully building equity. 

Is there is a way to continue contributing to my retirement accounts, while still obtaining a downpayment? I've thought about asking friends/family for money, or even having them take out a low interest loan that I could pay back for them.

My aunt (a broker in PA) told me the market is too crazy right now to buy; my landlord (here in OR) told me a week later he's never seen a better time to invest. I am deeply torn. Any thoughts appreciated. Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,Question about cash-out mortgage refinance,"Last week, I closed on a refinance. In the lead-up to closing, the lending agency sent me several versions of the closing documents with different numbers, apparently due to additional information collected from my current lenders about payoff balances and such. The numbers I was checking were the interest rate (which remained fixed), the closing costs (which fluctuated a little but were reasonable), and the ""Cash to Close"" figure (which kept changing).

At one point, the ""Cash to Close"" number dropped by quite a lot. I called the loan officer, and he said that it was because the new lender will fully fund an escrow account for property taxes and insurance. He said that that I would receive a refund check from my current lender, approximately equal to the difference, once my current escrow account was closed. Okay, seemed reasonable.

I'm looking at the final closing document, and it has a line that reads (with a specific number $x):

&gt; Cash to Close: $x, To Borrower, Includes Closing Costs

All good. I signed the paperwork with a notary and provided my banking info. I received a message from the lender indicating that my loan had been funded.

A few days later, I received a wire transfer from the lender... of about $3,000 less than $x.

I contacted the loan officer again, and seemed confused and said he'd look into it. He gave me the story about the escrow account again, but I'm skeptical because we've already been down this road when the ""Cash to Close"" number was fluctuating - but the last document has a specific ""Cash to Close"" number.

The loan officer was supposed to get back to me last week, and he didn't. I left a message and asked for a callback today, and haven't heard anything.

Anyone have any idea what the hell is going on here? Am I right to be concerned, or is this somehow normal? Thanks in advance.",finance

20yr fixed @ 2.75% (I think this is wrong) @ $408/mo

15yr fixed @ 2.75% @ $469/mo

The lady at the credit union said the 15yr was the best option because of the rate, even though it apparently has the same rate as the 20yr fixed, which is why I said I thought the 20yr was wrong. However, I did a loan amortization spreadsheet with paying the same amount I do now ($625) and basically the 30 and 15 had the near same pay off date  Feb/30 for the 30 and Dec/29 for the 15. With 30yr, $270 extra would go towards principal and with 15yr, $156 extra would go towards principal Should I just go with the 30 year? 

Also, the interest on these loans would accrue daily and not monthly, which I have read that if I pay half with each check, that will cut even more interest off the loan. Does anyone have a spreadsheet or calculator to help me determine when my payoff would be if I did that?

I'm just trying to pay off my house ASAP. So if anyone knows a place offering better rates, please let me know. Credit score is just below 800.

Hello, 

In May of 2019 I made a post on r/personalfinance asking about [Student Loan Consolidation](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/bpx18r/considering_student_loan_consolidation/) . I am truly thankful for all the kind tips and advice that was shared on that thread. I am also happy that I did not end up consolidating my student loans because of COVID-19 (Read the info posted above).   


Since April 1st, I have been paying $650 per month toward the Unsubsidized Loan that would have the highest interest rate if it weren't for the temporary suspension of interest rates. I am about to increase the amount to $700 per month (Every 6 months I have been increasing the amount I pay off by $50).   


Is there any reason why I should not be paying these loans off while taking advantage of the 0.00% interest?  


Are there any scenarios where paying the loans off  during forbearance would be a disadvantage financially? Such as if the election swings left and student loan debt is abolished, this will be all for naught. I know that is a extremely unlikely example, but I just want to be sure I am making the correct decision to continue paying off student loans rather than waiting until the interest kicks back in January 2021.

personalfinance,"Parents in debt, in the red every month, job loss at the end of the year. No idea what to do.","Hi PF,

I need some advice for my parents, father is 68, mother is 59. I will try to make this as cohesive as possible, but please forgive me if it's all over the place. And because I'm still combing things over, there are going to a lot of estimates at this moment.

I recently moved back in with my parents to save money and to help them by paying rent. I forced them to look over their budget since they never seem to have savings, and, honestly, at first glance, I don't know how they have been making it. Tonight, we sat down and I introduced them to YNAB and that's our starting point, but there's still a bit we have to go through. They've seen the issues, though, and seem to be serious about working on it.

That being said, with their current income (not including what I'm paying in rent), I think they'll continue to be in the red for a few months. My rent payments will help, but I don't know how long I'll stay here. I'm not close with my family, to say the least. To add to that, my dad's job will be closing at the end of the year. He will get SSI, but he already has been receiving that and even still, they're still in the red.

So, the general estimates are:

Income: $45,000/yr combined income + SSI.

Post job loss: $25k (he makes $20k-ish, net). And I'm currently paying $600 for my room from them, though I'm an unreliable variable in this situation.

They have $140,000 in debt to various credit cards and loans, as well as the house and car loans, but not including any medical payments/debts.

The 3 biggest culprits are:

House: $88k remaining - $1052/month (I think I saw a 4.5 interest rate, but I didn't really catch the details--just a glimpse of the account).

Dad's car: $17k \~$300/month

Mom's car: $26k \~500/month

**The $88k and the car loans are a part of the $140k in debt.** Sorry that I did not make this clear before.

I have already informed them that they will have ""most likely"" sell one of their cars at the end of the year (they were stressed after seeing the numbers. I put it gently. As we go along, I will absolutely push for them to sell a car). I don't know their payment plans either, but I'm pretty sure they got the worst rates/terms/etc. as far as interest goes for their cars, too. I have a brother who said he'd potentially be willing to help, especially if it allows them to keep the house, though he's shit with money, too.

They declared bankruptcy a couple years ago, too, as I'm sure that will be pertinent information. I have no idea what their medical debt looks like, but we'll be looking at that over the evenings of the next few days. My mom asked me my opinion about whether they should take out a home equity loan, but I honestly know shit about that. They'd like to keep the house, and it'd be nice for them to. But, ultimately, I just want my dad to enjoy life for once so however that can happen would be cool. Sorry these are estimates and all that, but as we continue to work on it, I just want to know what direction to point them to. So. Any ideas on how to tackle this moving forward?

TL;DR: Parents $140k in debt. Biggest factors are house, and two cars. Dad's losing job at the end of the year. Current income: $45k. Post-job loss: $25k. What should they do?

Edited: Slightly more concise, haha.

CryptoCurrency,Coinbase Offers US Feds New Crypto Surveillance Tools - CoinDesk,,cryptocurrency
stocks,Timing the market,"This is purely an opinion post. I feel like there are misconceptions about what “timing the market” is on this sub. People will tell you that holding any cash or buying at the right price is considered timing the market and that you should just buy in now if you plan on holding long term. 

* Basing your buy and sell strategies because you think the market is going to go up or down in the near term and you want to get the same company at a few % lower price. This is obviously timing the market as you are, well, trying to time the market. Nobody can predict short term volatility moves and for all anyone knows we could have S&amp;P 3,000 or S&amp;P 4,000 in a month. 

* Sitting on 100% cash because you are waiting to buy when it crashes. Buffett himself has said that sitting on the sidelines of a great game because you think you can find a better time to enter is a terrible mistake. For all you know, the markets can keep going up for years and years and you’re missing out on great returns. This strategy is how you end up FOMOing in near the top because the markets just keep going up and up and everyone’s on /r/stocks talking about their amazing returns, and you finally get fed up with your -2% cash returns and buy in. If you stick to your gut and don’t fall in, however, it’s not a horrible idea, markets will go down, it’s not completely invalid. For example, someone who saw the euphoria in early 2020, 2007 or the late 90’s and said to himself that he’s not going to fall for the tulip mania, probably ended up making great returns as he quickly deployed his cash after the crash. On the other hand, someone who had been sitting in cash since 1995, 2005 or 2016 probably ended up in the first category. This leads me to my next point. 

* Building a cash position. This is absolutely not timing the market and is a completely valid and probably very smart position no matter what market cycle we are in. The bad thing about cash is the very low returns. I (again my completely personal opinion) is that you should always keep a decent cash position in your portfolio to buy with. Not 100%  or even 50 or 25%, but having some easily accessible purchasing power on hand at all times is a very good idea, and is NOT “timing the market” to wait for a good price. Again, building a cash position is a perfectly valid strategy, as long as you aren’t completely out of the market.

* “It’s for the long term”. A very important rule of investing that is held by almost every successful investor, is: The price you pay for it is the difference between a great company and a great stock. Sure a lot of these hot tickers on reddit will continue to grow in revenues and expand their businesses, I have no doubt in it, but if a company already has 10 years of growth priced into the stock, are you really getting what you pay for? Stocks don’t and won’t keep going up forever. 

* “Buy the dip”. People on here will call this timing the market, however I completely disagree. Anyone who says dip-buying is market timing is encouraging FOMO. The best time to buy in is when the streets are full of blood. There is nothing invalid about seeing a company you would love to be invested in, and seeing that it’s expensive right now and not buying it right now. There will be an opportunity in the future, and in the mean time, instead of just sitting on cash, there are always opportunities on the market. Some sectors are expensive right now and others are cheap. Add the expensive on to your watch list, closely monitor it and start looking for companies trading at a fairer price. A common sentiment I see a lot is that “well if you wait, it’ll just keep going up and up and up”. That sentiment is pure FOMO fueling. 

I’m drunk right now so I typed this whole post up, hopefully someone reads it and gains some value, even more hopefully someone just shits all over me because I’m making no sense, either way have a good night and thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Current car loan rates?,"Hey everyone, I’m curious if auto loan rates have decreased in a way similar to mortgage rates. 

I’d like to finance a 25,000 dollar used vehicle (2017 camaro convertible), my credit score is 720 and I make near 6 figures.

personalfinance,How aggressively should I be paying off my student loans?,"I currently bring in $2800/month and have about $1000/month in living expenses. I also have about ~$9000 in federal student loans with ~2.5% interest rate. I’m in graduate school, so I’m eligible for deferrals but I haven’t requested them yet because my cost of living is so low right now, I’m still in the grace period for payments, and I’ve been pretty aggressively paying them off the last three months (paid ~$11,000 down (including all the interest accrued) to ~9,000). Is this necessary? I’ve just been doing it because I can, but does that mean I should be doing this? I’ve also been trying to save a little bit, but I’ve been prioritizing paying off my loans. Should my priorities be reversed?

nuclear,Canadian Green Party is about the elect a new leader. I'm asking candidates to commit to visiting a nuclear power plant by Jan 31st. Leadership election ends Oct 3rd.,"This would be a pretty small accomplishment, but it seems actually doable.

I've also spoken / tweeted with many of the candidates, and they're all anti-nuclear. I'm incapable of shifting their position.  So scaling back expectations here. Most people opposed to nuclear power take a long time to change their minds, and perhaps a visit to a NPP will begin that process.

If you are a Canadian Green and registered to vote in their leadership race my suggestion is to chime in with a similar commitment. If you're not a Green the deadline to join and vote in this leadership race has passed.

This of course does NOT mean one needs to support Greens in federal election.

Thank you for emailing **Amita Kuttner**’s campaign about this.

As a physicist, Amita has a firm understanding of the science and is not strictly opposed to nuclear power. However they do have serious concerns with regards to regulation and the storage of waste. In particular on unceded Indigenous land without their free, prior and informed consent. 

Amita is open to funding research for nuclear technology and nuclear waste strategy, but they would be unlikely to approve of any new projects until Canada’s regulatory gaps are closed.

**If they are elected Green Party leader on Saturday they would absolutely be willing to visit a nuclear power facility. I am not sure if a visit could be arranged on the timeline you propose but they are absolutely open to it.**

Hello Gord, 

Thanks for reaching out and for your advocacy.

With respect to nuclear energy, my current view, and that of the Green Party, is that it is not a viable option. While nuclear energy could hold potential for deep de-carbonisation, I consider it to be too expensive, takes too long to construct (given the timelines set out by the IPCC) and we have still not adequately resolved the issues regarding the safe storage of nuclear waste.

I have a cousin who is a professor of nuclear physics in the United States, and we have regular discussions about this. He also keeps me updated on research and advancements as he supports the use of nuclear energy in the fight against the climate crisis. I will continue to review and assess the viability of nuclear energy as a tool in combating the climate emergency.

Thank you again for reaching out.

Best wishes,
Annamie

personalfinance,Confusion on SmartyPig interest rates,"I've acquired a lot of Treasury Bonds, but I'm looking at a higher interest, zero to extremely low risk place to put the $$$ instead.  I came across SmartyPig, which seems fine, but the interest rates listed just don't seem correct.

For example, SmartyPig lists its APY as being 0.70% if you have over $50K in the account, and that's the lowest rate: https://www.smartypig.com/rates

A Charles Schwab high-yield Savings account, OTOH, lists it's APY as being 0.05% https://www.schwab.com/savings

So SmartyPig interest rates are 14x what Charles Schwab's are?  Either I'm miscalculating something or missing something, because that doesn't seem accurate at all.  Why would any human being ever get a Savings account from one bank when the one down the street pays out 14 times more?",finance
personalfinance,New Home Construction Loans - No Rate Lock??!,"Wife and I put a $2,500 hold on a lot to build a new home in the Chicago 'burbs... But today we find out that we cannot lock in our mortgage rate until 90 days before closing (5 months from now)?

We have until Saturday to back out - but if we move forward we must put 5% down (about $18,000) that is of course non-refundable.

I just think it is crazy in this environment (pandemic/election/economy) that my family has to risk losing our down payment in the event rates skyrocket and we have to back out....

Rate today is 2.75%, but that I fear that could soar to 4% or more in those 5 months. That would add $200/month to our mortgage and $70,000 over the life of the loan!

I know the fed has forecasted low rates but how much risk is this over 5 months?",finance
personalfinance,Would this consolidation idea work?,"I have 34k in debt. Currently we make ends meet and have a little cash left over each month for savings. We have 6+ months of savings.  Sadly, in 2 years, we'll have teh first kid out of day care and that will return $1,300/ mo to our savings and then 2 more years after, the remaining $1,300/mo (net of $2,600/Mo)

I am looking at SOFI at a 34k personal loan to consolidate the following:

CC1: 15,000 balance  
CC2: 7,000 balance  
Personal Loan (I know..) 12,400 Balance

I don't have the exact interest rates on me, but the consolidated rates below are well below any of rates on the debt except the P-loan at 8.99%.

They provided me the breakdown of each term length and it goes as follows:

 2 years: 1,483.55/ MO 7.404%

* 3 years: $1,035.68 8.104%
* 4 years: $813.05 8.478%
* 5 years: $688.04 9.188%
* 6 years: $603.43 9.522%
* 7 years:  $562.80 @ 10.12%

At first glance, I like the 7 year plan as it allows me to pay my current rate of $900/mo paying down the principal considerably vs the 7 year fixed rate of 562/mo. If time gets hard for any reason, I can still reduce my payment to the 562 and not be ""stuck"" at the higher monthly commitment. I.E, I have flexibility should i need that difference for any emergencies etc..

My questions to you are this:

&amp;#x200B;

I do not show an amortization spreadsheet for the applicable rates mentioned and I'd like to know how I find out my principal/interest pay down for each rate and then what benefit I would gain from the 7 year plan paid monthly at $900 v $562. (would that strategy pay off or no)

personalfinance,Choosing between two different jobs W2 (California) vs 1099 in Curacao,"I do travel work and am used to jumping from job to job, but recently got an offer to work in Curacao but as a 1099 which is completely foreign to me.

Job A in California W2 employee. This job would last 13 weeks.
Gross pay: 3593/week based off of a -
Taxable pay: 1864/week
House stipend (tax exempt): 1267/week
Meals and Incidentals (tax exempt): 462/week

Estimated total net based on plugging in $1864 into paycheckcity.com and claiming 0 deductions/Single - 
$1,264.93 + 462 + 1267 = 2993$/week net


Job B in Curacao as 1099 Employee. This job would last 60-90 days.
Gross pay: 100$ per hour x 40 hours per week = 4000/week gross.
Taxes-  
*9.5% Curacao Old age (AOV) and surviving dependents (AWW) insurance Rate in 2019 (not sure if non-residents pay into this)  
*9.3% Curacao Basic health care insurance (BVZ) in 2019   
*2.5% Curacao Average Accident insurance (OV) varies on risk level (0.5% to 5%) in 2019   
*1.9% Curacao Insurance for loss of income due to illness (ZV) in 2019   
*0.5% Curacao General insurance for exceptional medical expenses (AVBZ) in 2019  
*= 23.7% if AOV applies. 14.2% if AOV does not apply to non-residents.  
Then [income taxes in curacao](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-curacaohighlights-2020.pdf).  I applied a generic 23% based on a total income of 4000USD x 1.8 ANG x 8 weeks work = 57600 ANG that I would be employed there.  
So I am looking at a tax burden of 23.7%+23% with AOV or 14.2% + 23% without AOV.  
So post tax on a 4000/week income would be somewhere between 2132 - 2512/week?  
But based [on this site](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-curacaohighlights-2020.pdf), something called pensioner's regulations allows me to only pay a flat rate of 10%? It makes for a very different value argument.

I also haven't even considered Social security plus medicare tax - 15.3%. Or federal income taxes for the US.  I feel like all that high pay will be eaten away, but it really depends on how taxes are calculated.  On the bright side free housing in Curacao.",finance

personalfinance,"Advice/Help -- Credit Card closed, and other screw ups","EDIT: Just adding a bit of TL;DR to say what I'm really after is whether or not there's anything I can do with the bank to ease the blow to my credit score.  


I need some help figuring out how to rebuild my credit and the most appropriate moves forward. My screw ups have set my family back significantly and I just don't know how to move forward.

For starters, I noticed I screwed up when my credit score took a nose dive, dropping by 135 points, putting me around 550. The note said it was due to a credit card closing. Which was news to me. I hadn't received a notice, and the people at the bank today had a hard time pinning down exactly when it was closed themselves.

The long of it is, in january I had a baby. First time parent. Covid hits. I'm not working and my partner is taking only 60% of their pay in while on leave. Things slipped through the cracks, and I forgot to be diligent and pay my card for march, april, and may. Chalk it up to stress and stupidity. In June, the bank calls me, and I explain I was impacted by covid and that I would continue my payments immediately, and have since stayed on top. And they accepted it over the phone and seemed to indicate my account would move forward as normal.

Fast forward the end of August and I get a note on my credit that says an account closed. I assumed it was a mistake, because everything appeared normal on my end. However it wasn't. I just got off with the bank, and they closed the account due to overdue payments. They apparently close all accounts after 61 days of missed payments.

I'm back to work, and making great money, my partner is making great money, and we planned on beginning the process of looking to buy a house at the start of 2021. But my credit score is now in shambles. It's floating around 550 right now. A few years ago I had a 720, but because of various reasons and laziness, one by one my credit accounts closed due to inactivity. I worked really hard to get them under control, and didn't want to risk becoming overwhelmed with debt again, so I rarely used them and they closed because of it.

The bank says there is no way to reverse the closure. I'm assuming this is true, but can someone verify that? My next thought was to go on a hardship plan, which I may qualify for because of an account closure. It may help lower interest and allow me to pay it off faster. But what will that do to my credit? Is my best bet just to eat my mistake and pay it off quickly? Or should I pursue the hardship plan?

Also I tried filing a dispute with equifax, which has be at about 550 also, but after hours of attempts and phone calls, it turns out they can't even verify me. They said they had no record of me.... Which doesn't seem true since they have a score for me. They asked me over the phone to send a copy of ID, social security card, and a letter stating it's me (or something. I don't quite remember wtf they needed a letter for, but were adamant I send one).

What can I do about this closed credit card with regards to the bank? What can I do to quickly rebuild my credit? Or at least as quickly as possible. I know I fucked up, and I'm feeling a bit like it may have been for good. My partner's credit is recovering nicely, approximately 690 or so.

some info about my financials if it helps:

Income**$7,000** \- approximate combined income AFTER taxes.

Expenses**$1,200** \- rent for housing**$700 - $1,000** \- Utilities, insurance, etc**$400** \- child care**$800 - $1,000** \- groceries, diapers, etc

We have two credit card payment to make (one is closed)**$5,000** total (closed) - been paying approx. $500 a month since resuming payments.**$8,000** total (we've been aggressively paying this off, did $2,000 this month, and plan to have it done by the end of the year)

My partner also has student debt that costs about **$700** a month, but since it's on hold due to Covid, we decided to aggressively tackle the credit card debt first since it's higher interest rate.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, Sept 30. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 30, 2020**

Stocks traded higher throughout the day before pulling back steeply in the last hour of trading in another extremely volatile day. While major benchmarks are up around 4% in the last five trading days, intraday volatility has been extreme, making options trading difficult. Traders weighed a wild presidential debate and developments among Congressional lawmakers for further fiscal stimulus. Stocks recovered in the last 20 minutes of the market, capping off an extremely volatile final hour.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.68% up, the S&amp;P (SPY) finished the day 0.59% up, and the Dow (DIA) led the day finishing 0.99% up. 

Yesterday’s presidential debate between Pres. Trump and Joe Biden proved to be an extremely contentious affairs, with Trump frequently interrupting both Biden the moderator, Chris Wallace who could not control the candidates, and a slew of highly personal attacks from both sides. The Guardian branded the debate ‘a national humiliation’. With the election in 36 days, analysts expect volatility to increase as November 3rd gets closer. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said “I think markets are really nervous into those 36 days \[before the election\] and one of the things we have to think about is, when does nervousness price in the worst is yet to come? When do you think the worst is priced in? There’s $4.3 trillion in cash on the sidelines. I don’t think in the history of any financial market in the world do you ever have a top when there’s 20% of the equity market sitting in cash. Investor cash — that’s excluding the private equity cash, the record cash held by corporates too. So you’ve got tons of dry powder. People are bearish.”

The election comes against a dire economic situation, especially in the labor, with major corporations recently announcing new rounds of job cuts. Disney (DIS) announced it was slashing 28,000 jobs in their theme parks, cruise line, and retailers. Shell (RDS) announced it was cutting 9,000 jobs as the pandemic has affected the demand for oil. According to CNN business, tens of thousands of airline jobs could be lost as soon as tomorrow, as a federal prohibition on job cuts in the industry expires. Airline executives say they are prepared to keep workers only if Congress approves $25 billion in grants. 

Congressional lawmakers and the Trump administration are attempting to come to a deal in the near-term to provide additional fiscal relief to the families and small businesses that are struggling in the pandemic. House Democrats are pushing forward with a new $2.2 trillion proposal as speaker Pelosi and the White House make a final attempt to strike a deal before the election. Today, Pelosi and Mnuchin were unable to strike a deal after a 90-minute meeting. The pair said they will continue discussion as they continue to work to craft legislation that could pass both Houses of Congress. House Democrats are holding a vote on their plan today, a largely symbolic gesture as McConnel has already opposed the plan. Republicans are rumored to have a $1-1.5 trillion ceiling for any new relief legislation.

personalfinance,"What’s the catch when car dealerships say they’ll offer you X amount for you car, regardless of its condition?","I’d assume they require you to buy one of their vehicles, which I intend to do. A dealership in my area says they’ll offer $3000 for your car, which is probably twice, perhaps 3 times the value of my car. What’s the catch? Ridiculous interest rates? What if I want to pay the full cost of the new vehicle up front?",finance
personalfinance,Refi: Move ahead or start over for slightly lower interest?,"I’m pretty far along in a refi process with my lender and they lowered my interest rate to 3.1 to compete with another estimate I received of 2.99. However, the other place is now saying rates are as low as 2.75. Is it worth starting over with the new lender even though I’m already conditionally approved with the original and moving ahead? Loan is 278k, 30 yr. closing costs somewhat similar.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay down my student loans or invest?,"Hello there. I just recently graduated from college (23M) with just over $20k in student loans at 4.5% interest rate and a $55k job. I am in grace period and my tuition payments don’t start until mid March. 

Should I try to aggressively pay off the loans or make minimum payments and invest the difference each month instead? I am living with my parents at the moment so I have no rent or major expenses. 

I have about $4500 cash with $2000 in an emergency fund and am debating on whether to invest or pay off debt with the remaining $2500. Any advice would be very helpful! Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Want to renew mortgage with a lower rate - how to calculate any savings/penalty,"I'm in a fixed mortgage and I know the penalty is either 3 months interest, or the interest rate differential. In my case it will surely be the IRD.

What I don't understand is how any savings are possible even if I lock in to a lower interest rate. 

As far as I can tell, the IRD is the amount I would save... and that is the penalty the bank wants to take! So where are my savings for making the switch?

For example, 300,000 mortgage, 5 year fixed (3 remaining), 25 year amortization, 3.5 % interest.
Suppose I want to jump down to 2.5 % interest.

I believe my IRD would be $30086.49 - $21418.27 = $8,668.22

Thats what I would owe to the bank as a penalty for renewing. But its also (by definition) the exact amount I would save by dropping to the lower interest rate.

So how would I ever come out ahead here? Why would anyone do this?

I'm 100% sure I'm missing something, just don't know what.",finance
Banking,Contract job question,"Wall of text, TLDR at bottom. X-posting to other subreddits.

So I’ve been working in banking for 2 years now, first year and some change was collections and then I moved to the branch as a banker/teller but since were chronically understaffed (never heard that before) I’ve been stuck as a teller a lot of the time. Coupled with this is extra stress from coworkers not doing their job, customers, and the fact that after going to college I’m stuck making $17/hr.


I have an interview on Monday with a recruiting agency for a temp job as a mortgage loan processor. This is something I’ve been looking for (trying to get into underwriting) and it pays $22/hr and is remote. The bank I’d be contracted to is Huntington. The recruiter said that their contract minimum is 90 days, but the bank has the option to extend it and even bring me on full time. He did say that a lot of his previous round of people were on contract for about 8 months before being brought on but some were brought on at 90 days. 


I’m trying to decided whether or not this is a good opportunity. I have about 3-4 months of expenses saved up. Maybe more since some of my student loans are on hold till March. Issue is in December I’ll be getting an apartment that’ll be a significant chunk and I have two cats. My fear is that in a few months time I could be without a job during COVID. Living in Michigan is not the best as far as wages and job opportunities go. 


TLDR; Stressful, underpaid, and permanent job but i have an opportunity to have a higher paid remote job that’s contract to hire. Low expenses now but high expenses if contract ends in 90 days, which it could. Help me out internet.",finance

personalfinance,Reducing my withholding for 2020,"To give context, I am a student who has just graduated from college, and plan on WFH through the end of the year. To that end, I am trying to save as much money as possible into my Roth 401k while living at home with little to no expenses and a decent savings built up.

I have calculated that because I am working for a little less than half the year at my new job, and a job I worked earlier this year, I have already paid my fair share of taxes (ie I am already going to receive a refund even if I don’t pay another cent of federal income tax and continue earning at the same rate at my current job). When I try the IRS withholding calculator it was not of much help.

Any advice on how to not pay any more federal income taxes by adjusting my W4? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,I need help saving money,"Here's the thing I'm terrible at saving money. I grew up with a mom who showed me that even though we're struggling it's ok to spend money as if we were rich. Obviously I can't keep blaming her because I'm 19 now. The thing is she's been borrowing money from me since I was like 10. I used to be really good at saving but I guess in my mind I thought that if spent all my money she wouldn't have to ask me for anything or that I should spend everything on me because I never get to. My dad just called me and told me that I need to learn how to save some money and I felt bad because how do I tell him that I spend all my money on my self so that my narcissistic mother doesn't use all of it. I was never able to buy anything for myself I've had the same pair of shoes for three years. I never get to treat myself. I always have to give my money to her. I'm not trying to come off as a whiny and I hope I'm not explaining this poorly but I need help learning how to save money for myself, I don't want to be trapped. My whole preteen life to now I've spent all my heard earned money on a family I didn't even make. My mom has no job and she's constantly borrowing from me I'm always left with nothing for myself. I genuinely am not trying to come off as a spoiled brat who doesn't know how to control herself. As you have read I have deep rooted problems with money. 

*edit: I still live with my mom and I have two younger siblings who are autistic so they need to be fed. Neither of my parents work.",finance
