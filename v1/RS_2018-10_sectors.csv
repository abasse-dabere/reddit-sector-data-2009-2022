stocks,Chase Sapphire Reserve is the GOAT: Long Live $JPM,"Okay, so I did a little research on $JPM trends around dividend distribution time. The ex-dividend date for 2018 Q3 is on Thursday, October 4, 2018. 

I looked at the past seven $JPM quarters and looked at the difference of the closing price three days prior to the ex-div date (i.e., Tomorrow) and trading high of one day prior to the ex-div date (i.e., the final date buyers can trade to receive the div).  These numbers don’t take into account that JPM just raised their dividend by 43%.

The run-up for the last seven quarters was:

2017 
Q1: 2.47%
Q2: -.09%
Q3: 2.37%
Q4: .006%

2018
Q1: 1.43%
Q2: 3.02%
Q3: 1.29%
Average: 1.50%

$JPM dropped 4.13% last week (along with the entire financial sector) although fed interest rates rose.  There were scares about Italian Bank contagion—except JPM only has minimal exposure to Italy (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/reuters-america-u-s-money-markets-have-minimal-italy-exposure-j-p-morgan-securities.html). Then, there may be a NAFTA deal before night’s end. 

Not to mention Chase is the shit. I mean, if you’re not rocking a CSR, CSP, or CIP—you’re a fucking loser. They just implemented YouInvest and are disrupting the banking industry with their block chain platform (https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/75-banks-have-now-joined-jpmorgan-to-test-blockchain-payments). 

These examples are meant to show that the company is STRONG—and there’s little reason to think $JPM won’t, at a minimum, trade how it has for the past seven quarters. 

If that’s the case—then I’d expect $JPM to be trading 1.50% higher on Wednesday ($114.63). 

tl;dr buy the goddamn dip on $JPM. Long live the Chase Sapphire Reserve.",finance

I tried picking up divinity: original sin 2 but I couldn't get any further than act 2 with out getting straight up bored, even breath of the wild, having to get food and cook it, it all just feels so tedious! Is there anything other people do to make games feel not so boring/tedious?

Or what are some awesome games I should try playing that are just straight fun? (pc/switch)",technology

personalfinance,File new W4? - No Longer Exempt from Withholding,"I am a full-time college student in Georgia, and I work part time on campus.

When I began working in 2016, I used the IRS's Interactive Tax Assistant, which told me I did not need to file a tax return because I made under a certain amount of money a year (about $6350). Therefore, I claimed an exemption from withholding for 2016 and then 2017, which I renewed again for 2018, under the belief I would still make under $6350. 

In addition to working more hours this year, I received a $5000 stipend from my university to support (i.e. housing, food, etc.) an unpaid summer internship. From my understanding/research, since the stipend is for non-tuition expenses, it needs to be taxed as income.  As a result, my total income will be above the $6350 line for 2018.

On my employment/HR website, I see that I can file a new W-4 anytime my ""tax situation changes"" and I can choose to have more, or less, tax withheld.

Since I am no longer able to claim exemption from withholding, should I go ahead and file a new W4? Or is there a better time to do so?   
When tax season comes around, will I need to pay for the federal/state taxes for which I did not originally pay? 

Also, I don't think it matters, but, in case it does, the $5000 from my university was deposited directly into my parents' bank account. They originally had paid for my summer housing, so they kept approx. $3000 of it and transferred the rest to me.

Thank you in advance for the help!

personalfinance,"Car broke down, some savings, should I avoid any financing? At what point does leasing makes more sense than buying?","My car of 11 years is broken, at 230k, 99' accord.  May or not have an easy repair, but car bumpers are really damaged (both broken, type of damage that needs a new part), car hisses very loudly when AC is started), electrical system glitches, etc.  I'll get it checked properly but so far simple things have been ruled out. These are the options I've come up with so far, struggling to decide how much to spend on a car. I drive ~15 miles daily in average. Idk how much car I can afford.

1- Pay up to $7k cash for whatever reliable car I can find. Sounds like most sound decision, but much more time-consuming than my other options along with the risk factor of buying a piece of crap. 

2- Get a bit of a newer car 2013+, finance the difference. Have excellent credit, but I rather not spend more on a car that I need to. And Idk how much I could really finance.

3- Lease a car. I would lease a Honda Civic or something similar. My main worry is that this may be too expensive, I always see those signs that make it appear very cheap, but I have a feeling that they screw you over with the insurance or something similar. Anon leasing a similar car, what does that monthly payment looks like for you? 


About my finances,

Positives:

- I have 7k car fund saved, 3K emergency fund

- No credit card debt . Credit score ~750. 

- Make 60k before taxes (4k gross per month after insurance and deductions)

- No kids, not married  


Negatives:
-  $1200 rent (no plans for buying due to high COL area, likely relocation in 3 years)

- $200 phone and utilities , gym, car insurance 

- $400 food/going out.

- $400 student loans

- $400 to savings 

- $400 for my vacations/mini trips savings

- 210k student loans (MD) - interest rate ~3%, repaye plan

- ~1K left (it's new raise of $400 per month and finished paying some credit card debt, so now it's mainly to go to savings).",finance

personalfinance,Young professional trying to save aggressively but no clear financial goals. Advice needed on budgeting and direction.,"**Part 1: High-Saving Budget Advice**

I'm 25yo making 110k/yr. I want to save aggressively so that I can be FI (but not necessarily RE). My current planned annual budget:

* 26.4k for rent/utilities (2.2k/mo)
* 7k for food (estimating more than 500/mo)
* 18.5k to max out 401k
* 13.75k to max out my ESPP (12.5% of salary) and sell asap for 15% profit (minus tax)
* 1.45k to max out HSA (company provides 2k, so I only have 3.45k max limit - 2k match = 1.45k to contribute?)
* 33k for all taxes/SS/etc with 401k deduction (estimating using online tool but not sure exactly how to calculate all this)

Note: don’t have need for a car currently.

Left over: 9.9k + ESPP return from previous year so ~24k/yr of minor health insurance deductions/fun/travel/tech toys/“idk what to do with” money. I currently have 30k in a savings account as an emergency fund.

Does this seem like a reasonable high-level plan for someone who wants to save well? Obviously I’ll need to adjust as I go through expenses since I’m currently only estimating. Not sure if I should look into IRAs since I think those aren’t applicable to me because of my earning status.

**Part 2: Unknown Long Term Goals**

My biggest issue is that I don’t know what my future goals are. Will I have a partner one day? Will I own a home one day (definitely not in California…)? With all these unknowns, I’m not sure if dumping everything into retirement accounts is a good idea, although I still like the idea of being FI. 

If I ever wanted to buy a home, I’d have to save enough cash for a downpayment, but don’t know if/when/where that’ll happen. Simply saving a bunch of money each year in an at-best 2% interest rate savings account seems like a waste if I decide to rent for a long time and could’ve had the money invested.

Would appreciate some advice on how to deal with this uncertainty.",finance
personalfinance,Help! I bought a property for $350k and it’s now worth $270k and I still owe the bank $330k and I need to sell.,"I need to sell as it is only a 2 bedroom unit and not adequate for a family. I bought it when I was single just to ‘get into the property market’. Who knew the market was going to crash! It’s not going to recover to its original level any time soon. My partner and I are on average incomes 65k and 55k respectively. We want to buy a home that we can live in and have a family. The said they will lend us what we need for the home we want provided we can save the deposit.  I must first sell my property but this would leave me with a debt to the bank and make saving for the deposit near impossible. Does anyone have any idea what to do in this situation?

Edit:

Thanks for all the replies. To clarify, we are in Australia. If I sell it short I’ll have to take out a personal loan to pay off the owed amount. The high interest rates of a personal loan make saving hard. 

I currently have the place rented out. The rent I receive only covers half of the mortgage so I have to make up the difference out of my salary + pay rent for the apartment we currently live in.

The problem is my partner doesn’t like the property I own and doesn’t want to live in it. We tried and she didn’t last more than a few months. I know how pathetic that sounds - but it is still a reality I have to deal with. And yes this is totally a case of ‘wanting’ to sell and get a better place as opposed to ‘needing’ to sell. 

I feel so stupid buying this place when I was single. At the time house prices were rising rapidly and I thought that if I didn’t get ‘in the market’, I never would. Had I just waited a few years, my partner and I could simply purchase the house we want no hassles.",finance

personalfinance,Car dealer asked me to temporarily make car loan payments for a lower overall price,"I offered to pay cash for a car, but during the haggling process, my car dealer asked if I could finance the car instead, and keep the loan for at least four months before paying it off. He was taking $1,800 off a what would be a $11,800 loan, so I verbally agreed. I haven't signed anything related to the loan yet, so I'm not worried at the moment, but I wanted to know more about this.

The dealer claims that the bank will kick the dealership back some money after four months assuming that the customer is making payments on a loan. I'm not terribly interested in paying four month's worth of interest if I don't have to though. I don't know what percentage they'll be offering me. Obviously if it's out of bounds I'll just get my own loan or pay cash instead. Is this something they are going to write into the fine print to try and force me to do?

Edit: A lot of your are asking about prepayment penalties, I specifically asked about that and he said no. He further said that those are illegal in New York, maybe specific to car loans.

personalfinance,15% down and pay off cars VS. 20% down and keep car payments,"Hey PF,

I'm trying to figure out if it would be smart to put 15% downpayment on a house and possibly have PMI VS. putting 20% down and continuing car payments for two vehicles. After lurking around and being mentored by my parents, it seems like the answer is ALWAYS put down 20% and DO NOT take PMI...But when I look at the numbers, I feel like putting down 15% and taking PMI (if necessary) would hold me back for a few years before I could pay off either vehicle and open up some more cash flow.

Some info:
We both have credit score in the high 700s-800s.

Car #1 - 32 months @ $353/mo
Car #2 - 60 months @ $278/mo

~$25k to pay off both immediately

We are looking at a house for around $400k and putting 15% ($60k) down and taking a $340k loan @ ~4.5% for 30 years. Now, we may have the possibility to have no PMI through Navy Federal. But assuming we do need it, it surely will not be more than $631/mo (total of both cars per month). So if I pay off both cars and put that $631/mo towards PMI and my principal, I should have the 20% equity in about 24-36 months...which then allows me to put the $631+PMI/month towards savings/stock/paying down mortgage faster.

Now if I put 20% down and take a $320k loan @ ~4.5% for 30 years, the monthly payment goes down by about $100/mo and no PMI, but I'm still tied up paying $631/mo on the two cars for at LEAST 32 months before it drops to $278/mo for the remaining 28 months.

If it helps, we don't forsee moving within 10+ years, and we both have lived in this area our entire lives.

Am I thinking about this correctly? I could pay off both my vehicles and have no PMI within 24-36 months instead of paying the mortgage and still having car payments for 32-60 months before I open up any extra cash flow. Could someone provide some feedback as to how I may be looking at this wrong? Or do I just have the feeling that I'm wrong since it goes against the 20% down rule that's been engraved in my brain?

If you need more info, just ask and I will provide what I can. Thanks!!",finance
personalfinance,Any way I can save more? (Long post),"So I am looking to see if there is a better way to allocate my money. Here is a little about me. I am 31, recently divorced, home owner and dad of 2 and E-6 with 9.5 years in the Navy. I have two major sources of debt which are my home and vehicle. I do not have any other debt and use a capital one quicksilver card for all my purchase to take advantage of the cash back rewards. And yes, I do not carry a balance on that card. My credit score has been hanging around 800. It recently dropped a little due to the closing of a credit card I had with my ex wife. Here is a breakdown of my finances:

Income: 5487.99 before taxes. After taxes, life insurance, SS, and medical I have 4992.96/month

The first things to come out are my TSP(401k) allotment and child support. I put in $103.61 to my TSP and my child support is $1175/month. Both of these deductions are broken up between the 1st and 15th pay period. All of this results in taking home $1857.46 and $1856.89 on the 1st and 15th respectively. 

Here is my debt. My house was a new construction and is a little over 3 years old. I currently owe $177,632.02 and my monthly payment is $1147.90 which includes taxes and insurance. My other loan is my car. I made a poor choice when purchasing this vehicle but it is my bed so i'll have to lay in it. I owe $23,861.21 and my monthly payment is $444.40. The interest rate on the car is 2.19%

My current savings is $3,104.72. I know this is not a lot but, I went from having zero savings when married to this in just under a year. I also had to re-furnish a large amount of my home. I auto transfer $150/pay period

Here is a break down of where my money goes. On the 1st and 15th of each month, $120.00 total gets transferred to 4 separate certificates. These are used to spread out the cost of Christmas, my HOA dues, Summer activities for my kids and one is just used to have a savings I cannot touch for a year. $1,100.00 is transferred to a separate account for my bills. The rest of my money remains in a primary account that I used to pay off my CC.

My bills are as follows: $1147.90 for house, $444.40 for car, $80.00, internet, $104.87 for car insurance, $79.16 for phone and approx $200.00 for electric and water for a combined total of $2056.33. These payments are split over the month so that I’m paying approximately the same amount per pay period. The $1,100 I transfer per period covers this total and is building a small built in buffer. 

With the $1370.00 transferred out, I am left with $487.46 and $486.89 for each period to cover gas, approx $50/wk, food, and recreation. I haven’t done a full check but I spent approx $600 on food for the month of september. That included a higher than normal amount of eating out due to family being in town and work related events. 

Correct me if I’m wrong but the main area that I can adjust my spending is my food. Everything else is pretty set in stone. Please if you see any areas in which I can do more to save, I’d greatly appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.",finance

It's such a HUGE source of stress and anxiety in my life. At this point, I'm going to have to ask my Mom for money to even be able to go home for xmas. 

I broke down my two credit cards, my student debt, and any other outstanding things I need to pay off. I am terrifyingly VERY into a deep hole.

personalfinance,"Moving to a new country, need some financial advice","Hey guys!

This is my first time posting on this sub so I hope this is okay! I just want to make sure that I have all my ducks in a row before I move! 

So I'll be moving to Japan to start a new teaching job in March. I don't know the exact date I'll be leaving or which city I'll be living in. I should find that out sometime either this month or next month. I'm 27 f, with absolutely no idea how to really adult when it comes to money, having never lived on my own before. 

So my financial situation now seems pretty good. I have no credit card debt, own my car, and I live with my dad who doesn't make me pay rent (Thank you daddy!!!). I have about $18,500 in savings and will be working a steady job up until about 2 weeks before I leave. 

When I get to Japan, I will be responsible for all costs as far as setting up my apartment. Have no idea what rent will be yet, but it will be taken directly out of my check as well as taxes and national heath insurance costs. I will be responsible for paying my phone bill and my utilities. As well as I have to pay for my flight there, which just scouting around seems to be in the $500-580 range.

I will not get my first paycheck until the end of May, which really sucks, but that's how my company does things. I will be paid 215,000 Yen a month before taxes and rent and stuff.

There are some things I would like advice on as far as how much money to leave here and how much money to take with me. 

I know that I can take $10,000 USD with me and not have to declare it with customs. My company recommends to bring at least $5,000 USD but everyone I talked to who works for this company said to bring as much as you can for start up costs.

My dilemma is really with my school loans.  I just want to make sure that I leave enough money in my US bank account so that I don't have to transfer money back and forth because it's quite expensive.

I have 4 loans
The first loan doesn't even go into repayment until next month but I've already been paying on it.

It's a Direct Unsub Stafford Loan from Myfedloan.
Right now the total is $4730.20 (4.66% interest)

The payments will be $50 a month but I've been paying $80 twice a month just trying to get rid of it.

The next 3 are all through Navient (all are currently in repayment)
1 - Subsidized Stafford loan - $2269.03 (5.6% interest)
Monthly payment is $38.77 but I've been paying $45 twice a month

2-unubsidized Stafford loan - $3493.18 (6.8% interest)
Monthly payment is $62 a month, I've been paying $70 twice a month

3-unsubsidized stafford loan - $1619.63 (6.8% interest)
monthly payment is $30.70 a month, I've been paying $50 twice a month

So if my calculations are correct, I would need to leave about $3200 minimum just to pay my loans if I was paying them at the rate I am now once a month. Is this correct? Is there anything I'm not considering?

Some other questions:
1. My credit union has offered me a credit card with no foreign transactions fees. I've never had a credit card before so I immediately just dismissed it. Should I take another look at it? Just to keep for emergencies? 
2. Anyone know a cheap way to transfer money back and forth?
3. Should I take more than $10,000 USD and declare it with customs? What's even the process for that?
4. I considered just paying all my loans off, but my financial adviser at my credit union said not to because it would be better for my credit. Is this so?

I'm sorry this ended up being so long, but I just wanted to be clear about my situation. Thank you in advance for any responses and any additional advice would be highly appreciated!",finance
computers,A Dad that needs some help!,"Hi everyone. I'm hoping that someone out there can help me. The basic gist is that my young Son is really in to online gaming. Last year for Christmas I bought he, and his Sister what I viewed as half way decent PC's, nice big 27"" wide screen monitors, so on and so forth. Frankly I had no idea that certain games require such beefed up systems. I figured they'd be just fine with the computers I bought them.

So my Son saved all summer to upgrade his graphics card, believing it'd solve his issues. The games run on his current PC, just they bog down a bit from time to time.

This is what he bought: 

MSI Gaming GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB GDRR5 128-bit HDCP Support DirectX 12 Low Profile Graphics Card (GTX 1050 TI 4GT LP)

The computer he put it in to is this:

HP 16VFHPDT0365 8000 Business High Performance Tower Desktop Computer PC (Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 3.0G, 4G DDR3, 160G, DVD, Windows 10 Professional)

personalfinance,Any advice on investing $1500?,"I have about $1500 in my savings account at Navy Fed earning about $0.17 per month. I'd like to be able to make a little more interest as well as contribute a couple hundred on a monthly basis, with the added benefit of keeping the money slightly out of reach so that I don't spend it. I'm thinking of opening a Vanguard mutual fund, does anyone know if there's a minimum to open an account, which account might be the safest to earn the most interest, and if there are any other companies I should be researching?

My budget allows me to save about $300/month, and I would be interested in adding that to my mutual fund every month. Most of my debt is either paid off or being paid off. My highest APR on my debt is just over 5%, is it practical to earn over 5% APY, and if my APY &gt;APR would it be wiser to invest faster and pay off slower, or invest slower and pay off faster?",finance
personalfinance,"Paying the bare minimum for student loans, and then having the rest forgiven?","Hey, does anyone around here know anything about the [Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service#apply)?

It looks like as long as you make a total of 120 (=10 years) on-time payments for your student loans, while working for a nonprofit organization, the rest of your federal loans can be forgiven.

From my understanding, the amount you're paying monthly doesn't matter... so I'm thinking that the way to maximize the benefit of this program is to pay the minimum amount every month for the next 10 years (and with my current salary, the most I could do would probably be close to the minimum anyway...). Of course, this would come back to bite me if something changed and I didn't end up reaching 10 years in a nonprofit, since the interest would pile up and I'd end up spending a lot more in paying them back. However, I'm working for a nonprofit now, and all available options for the future will have me working in some nonprofit as well, even if I go to a different organization - so I'm willing to take that risk.

Can anyone confirm or deny my reading of this program? Am I misunderstanding something, or is that actually how it works, and is that actually what I should do?

Also - what is the minimum payment on student loans? I'm still within the 6 month grace period after graduation, and so it won't show me on my account. Does the minimum depend on the total owed (\~$70K)? Could someone at least give me a ballpark?",finance

I am not so great with these calculations... so I ask for your help.

I will use fictional numbers for sake of clarity and privacy:

I currently have a loan of  1.000.000€ to the bank.

I am currently negotiating an interest rate of 1,4%  
Apart from the interest rate, I amortise 5000€ from my depth every month.  
I don't really have to pay that, and I guess many will say I should just invest that cash, but I do it for peace of mind in case the economy goes to shit.

So having these values in mind, how can I calculate by myself how long would take me to pay all my depth?

I have tried to use a bunch of websites like [https://www.drcalculator.com/mortgage/](https://www.drcalculator.com/mortgage/) but to no avail... I could only find the interest rate but I was not able to include the possible 5000€ I would deduct from my depth every month. Maybe I am missing something?

personalfinance,Inheritance Tax Implication,"Hello!

My father died when I was very young and left an inheritance. It's significant enough to have given me a great start at college (**Under 80k and over 40k**). He lived and died in California.

Because I was very young, **my older half sibling was holding the money until I was 18**. my primary caregiver was not entrusted with the money due to various behavioral issues. Very shortly after my father's death, the older half sibling moved to another state and I remained in California.

When I turned 18, I was cautious about the money affecting financial aid for college. my family's expected contribution was 0 and allowed me to receive all federal and state grants. I became concerned about receiving the inheritance and asked to delay it until I finished my education.

Now my questions are, I'm finishing college (with 0 debt) and the inheritance is mostly untouched and has grown a bit as my older half sibling put the **money in a fixed term CD that's renewed every year**. 

* What is my tax implication on this inheritance money if I were to get it now or in near future? 

* Would receiving it from somebody in a different state affect anything? 

* Would it be considered an inheritance or a gift considering my sibling has held it for such a long time?

I currently have an autoloan of 17k with a interest rate of 7% and 4 years remaining. I didn't have the greatest credit when I took out the loan, but have since been working to build that up and after several years, managing to get around 730 according to creditkarma.

I have a few concerns and also a strong desire not to throw away any more money. My main concern is refinancing my loan only to be hit with fees and end up in a situation worse off than I am now. My second concern is taking a hit to my credit which I've putting a lot of effort into growing. Thirdly, I'm putting a lot of faith that could end up being misguided into creditkarma.

personalfinance,What to do with extra $ outside of standard advice?,"My wife and I have both been pretty successful/lucky in our careers and are currently finding ourselves with a surplus of cash every month. We're following most of the standard financial advice (read below) and are wondering what would we should use the extra towards. Some facts:

* Both early 30s, married 1 year
* Combined salaries = $200k/year
* Both maxing out 401k and Roth IRA contributions 
* Both still have student loans, which we're both paying at least 3x the minimum payment

* Mortgage = $1065/mo
* Monthly surplus = $3-4k/mo
* No kids, three dogs

With accrued interests I owe $25,320.62

For the credit card, I have money in savings that I've been debating using to pay off the balance or like half one month and half the next. My SO has been paying all the bills since he makes more, but come winter he won't have an income and we will be living off mine + dipping into our savings since I make enough for bills and food, but nothing else like gas and other expenses. So I've put off using that money to pay off my credit card.

With this lump sum, I've played around with paying off the credit card, putting $5000 down on the car and then refinancing and continue to pay the same amount monthly to get it cut down faster, and then using the rest toward a loan. 

With the student loans, is it better to pay off the accrued interest or put money towards the balance? (even generally speaking if not for this situation)

personalfinance,How to approach mortgage/car payment,"To preface: I'm 25 years old with approx. 50k in savings, \~40k in investments and a net income of around $1,750 a month after expenses. No debt to my name. 

My girlfriend and I are planning on getting engaged/married in the span of about a year. She has about $100k mortgage and about $10k left on her car payment. Other than that, she has no other debt that I know of. She didn't put basically anything down when she bought the house so she's also paying whatever the ""insurance"" is on a no-downpayment mortgage.

I already put in my employer match in 401k and she does the same along with other investing (Roth's/IRA's etc). Combined we'll be making roughly 100k pre-tax. Monthly expenses will realistically be about 3k.

To limit the impact of interest, what would be the best approach in paying down the debt she/we have? Should we pay off the car first or put most of my savings into the mortgage to get that down first? I'd like to be debt-free relatively quickly before kids and other life expenses pop up.

My plan was to pay the minimum for the loans with the lowest interest rates, and the max for the one for the highest rate. My living expenses are relatively low, and I’m single with no dependents.

personalfinance,need a loan to pay back a HELOC loan after selling house,"TL;DR – we took out a loan for a down payment on a new house based on a presumed profit off of old house. We are not going to make as much as we though and need a way to pay off remainder of loan.
We live in an area that until very recently had one of the hotter real estate markets in the country. We made the decision to move to a neighboring county because they had much better schools, lower taxes and more of a family friendly reputation. We felt good about our situation because demand was greatly exceeding supply in the local housing market and we thought we would sell quickly for a healthy profit, turn that profit into a down payment on our new more expensive house which would keep our payment close to the same. 
Since the market was so “hot” the market was very competitive, people were typically making offers over asking, and houses were selling very quickly often before they officially hit the market. So in order to compete in this market we elected to take out a HELOC loan so we could have the immediate cash that would allow us to be pre-approved without selling our house. 
You may have already figured out our issue. Our house is not selling quickly and while we will make a profit it is not nearly what we were expecting. We basically waited too long to sell and hit the very end of the bubble and beginning of a cooldown.
We have lowered the price on our house and are getting some more interest. Unfortunately the amount we are left with after selling the old house will not cover what we owe on the HELOC loan. We will have to pay the remainder back once the house closes. We don’t have that money. I am looking into a new HELOC loan on the equity in our new house, and I have considered a home equity loan since they will have a locked in interest rate. Are there any other ideas on how to repay this loan cheaply?

personalfinance,Buying a house. Should we make a down payment? or skip it,"I recently ratified a contract to buy my first house at $475k.  Because I am using a VA loan, the down payment is optional.  Ie a 22k down payment my interest rate will reduce from 4.5% to 4.25%.  With closing costs, warranty and inspection this nets to a $34k upfront costs.  

The down payment saves us about 40k in interest over the 30 year lifetime of the mortgage and reduces our payments from 2400 to 2200.  

However, We're worried this is too heavy of a hit upfront.  My wife and I are 30.  Our total liquid assets are 45k:  10k in savings and 35k in a brokerage account.  This will leave us with 12k in investments.

(My wife also has 180k in student debts and about 10k in credit card debt.)  

My wife makes 78k per year.  I am currently a full time student using the GI bill.  I make about 20k per year from my benefits.  When Im out of school I expect my income to at least match hers.  

So, with our current spending power limited and our expectation that our future income will possibly double, is making the down payment a good idea?  I'm not feeling terribly comfortable with only having 12k in the bank- even though it creates long-term benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my third year of my undergraduate career. For the first two years of my education, my parents were on board and helped me with loans, taking federal loans that I cosigned and covered the cost of attendance in full. However, my parents gave me very late notice in August that they would not be financially contributing to my education and that I should either look elsewhere for assistance or withdraw. This has significantly strained my relationship with my parents, to the point where I have not seen or spoken to them or my two younger sisters, outside of a family vacation trip in late July, in over a year. They have made it abundantly clear that they will not assist me in anyway, financially or emotionally, to the point where my mother has purposefully avoided filing her taxes or filling out any paperwork regarding financial aid.

&amp;#x200B;

This, to my understanding, has taken away my ability to take out federal loans in any way, as I am incapable of filling out several documents for my university without my required parent's signature on each document. I've been in close contact with the financial aid office for my school, though they have not been incredibly helpful in working with me to remain enrolled and have reaffirmed that I need my parent's signature to move forward with financial aid.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now in my sixth week of classes, and the registration deadline for the university has passed, which led to me being withdrawn from university this morning. Additionally, I have no means to access Blackboard, which I need to complete and submit assignments for some of my classes, and am technically no longer enrolled at this university.

I am working with two family members, both from the same side of the family, who have expressed sympathy for my situation and want to help best they can. I am currently filing for a private loan with a company that is on the list of alternative loan options that my university website offers, and am having one of my family members cosign the loan. I, admittedly, am very behind the curve now, as I have only had a month to explore my options and get to the point that I am, and will still need to wait a period of time for all the documents and loan to process. As a result, I am faced with a few ramifications given that I did not fulfill my financial obligations:

&amp;#x200B;

* I am withdrawn from the university and am no longer a student.
* I owe rent to my landlords for September through October that is past due and will soon be sent to collections.
* I will lose my two student jobs on campus come Thursday morning.

While I've been avoiding sulking and getting down given that I am an adult and this is my responsibility, I am beginning to increasingly panic as my parents are no longer the support system that they were for the first 19 years of my life, and I am slowly watching my life fall apart.

I was also looking at CSP and the CSR since they also have the 50,000 bonus points after 4k. CSP is 2x points on travel &amp; dining and AF is $95 excluding first year, whereas CSR is 3x points on travel &amp; dining but AF is $450 including first year. I know SCR has a $300 travel credit but I read earlier that it's going away. Not sure how true that is though. With chase cards you can switch points around I guess? Though not sure how that part works. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway not sure which to apply for. What do you all think? My credit is pretty good but I hear Chase can be really strict so I'm afraid if I apply I will get rejected. I know about the 5/24 rule and no worries there.",finance

personalfinance,"Out of savings to pay for college next semester, should I cash out 401k or get student loans for next 3 semesters?","I am running out of savings to pay for college tuition, food, and rent.  I have currently accepted $5500 in loans from the government through the FAFSA for 2018 Fall to 2019 Spring Semester.  

I have $37k in a 401k and am wondering if it makes more sense to pull out the money each semester from there or take on private student loans.  The current private loans I am looking at would have a variable interest rate of 4.97% or 6.5% fixed rate.  

Finishing my next 3 semesters I project a need a of $37,800 if I am including food, rent, and tuition.  I currently work a part time job making $500 a month so that will lower it down.  

Any advice you can give will be much appreciated. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,What to do when you can’t afford college?,"I have a senior who will be graduating this year and after doing our FAFSA today, our EFC is $16000. I know it’s not a huge amount compared to others but what happens if you simply cannot afford it? I understand she can take the $5500 federal loan, but my husband and I are unfortunately unable to take on a loan of $10k+ and I would really prefer she not take private loans. Even our state school estimated net cost is almost $20k. Is community college the only option? How are solid middle class families affording college? I’m so discouraged. 

Backstory: Unfortunately my husband’s parents were not great at managing money and allowed him to rack up $50k in private loans during high school and 2 years of college PLUS another $20k in federal loans. We spent years paying off the $50k and unfortunately during that time our other student loans were deferred. Add to that almost $20k in medical bills for a special needs child that we’ve also paid off. Obviously during that time our deferred loans accrued interest and now we are having a hard time even paying them down. He still owes $11k and I still owe $27k. :/ I am literally sick about it. We were trying to do the right thing paying the medical debt, but in hindsight I feel like bankruptcy might have been a better solution. 

Due to all of the above, I do not want my daughter to have to take more than the federal loan and start off tens of thousands in debt, but unfortunately we honestly cannot afford to take on any additional debt. I feel like the worst parent ever. She has a 3.95GPA. 

Any suggestions?",finance

business,How Petrobras Built the Worlds Most Expensive Bribe Refinery,"Brazilian politics over the last few years have been a roller coaster ride. Former president Dilma Roesseuff was impeached from office, once beloved president Lula is imprisoned for illegally accepting an apartment from a powerful construction company, and the current Brazilian president the least popular president in the Americas. Operation Car Wash, a major anti-corruption probe has implicated 28 powerful corporations, and almost all of the nations political class.  Ordinary Brazilians are fed up with the corruption of their elites, and the upcoming elections in October of 2018, are expected to be the most volatile in modern Brazilian history. Today's podcast episode is about the scandal at the heart of the crisis, the massive corruption scandal at Brazil's state owned oil giant, Petrobras. The podcast will cover the history of Petrobras, the broader political system in which it functions and the incentives it creates for corruption, and the scandal that destroyed Petrobras's reputation.

Petrobras, at first glance, is the last state owned company one would expect in the middle of a corruption scandal. It has a long standing reputation for honesty and good governance. Brazilian politicians, both civilian and military, have allowed it to hire the best and brightest engineers without political interference. It has long been a trail blazer in deep see oil drilling, winning awards for its innovative approach for squeezing oil out of Brazil's challenging geology. It, despite the current scandal, has the lowest costs for recovering pre-salt oil in the world, with costs of extraction only at $8 per barrel. Moreover, the Brazilian government partially privatized Petrobras  and opened up Brazilian oil fields to international competition in the 1990s, reducing the scope for politicization of decision making, and forcing Petrobras to invest into maintaining global competitiveness. By 2009, Petrobras was the 25th largest corporation in the world, with a market capitalization of $110 billion, and annual sales of $90 billion.

However, Petrobras could not permanently escape to institutional weaknesses of Brazil's political system. The root of this problem lies in Brazil's political system, especially its electoral system. The 2014 Brazilian election cost somewhere between $ 2 billion and $ 4 billion USD. On a per capita basis, Brazilian elections cost almost as much as American elections, despite the fact the Brazilian economy is much smaller than that of America. Corporations the rely heavily upon government largess, especially Brazilian construction giants that rely upon massive public works projects, that donate most heavily to politicians. Brazilian politicians often represent their donors more than they do the voters who voted them into office. Once in office, politicians show little loyalty to party or ideology. Instead, they are most interested in reelection, pork-barrel politics, and scratching the backs of the corporations that financed their election campaigns. Unsurprisingly, Brazilian politicians find it easier to simply bribe politicians to vote the right way. In 2005, Brazil was rocked by a scandal when it was discovered the workers party paid $12,000 a month to opposition politicians to vote the right way. As Petrobras grew in scale and power, it became harder and harder for it to avoid this corrupt political system.

The major discoveries of oil in the late 2000s changed Petrobras's relationship to the rest of the Brazilian state. The government desired Petrobras to build oil refineries in the poorer regions of the country, ships built using unionized labor, and local content requirements to bring high technology manufacturing to Brazil. In order to accomplish these goals, the government appointed technocrats beholden PT, who didn't necessarily think of the profits of Petrobras first in its decision making. However, these politicized technocrats were quickly enmeshed into the political system. The basics of the Petrobras scandal was quite simple. The major Brazilian construction companies organized themselves into a cartel to bid for contracts. The companies would receive inflated contracts, and would in return donate 3% of the value of these contracts to politicians. About 2% would got the PT, with the rest shared between other parties, money launderers and the technocrats. The total costs of the Petrobras proved to be massive. Petrobras lost fife sixths of its market capitalization since 2008. Petrobras lost $1.8 billion in bribes, and fined $2.1 billion by the FCC for misleading investors. The Abreu e Lima refinery, supposed to be the largest refinery in Brazil, saw costs quadruple due to corruption and mismanagement. The massive scandal at Petrobras turned what should have been a golden opportunity to modernize the country into a fiasco.

personalfinance,Double Doctorate level of Student Loans Vs. House Down Payment Saving?,"Wife and I graduated college recently and currently make about $9700/month combined income after tax and retirement contributions. This is expected to increase to ~$13900/month take-home income following completion of my residency program next year. We currently live at home to offset my lower income this year but due to a lack of space and desire for independence we've decided that for the sake of our sanity we would like to buy a home this time next year. The only problem is that we currently have ~$450k in student loans combined with interest rates ranging from 5.3% to 7.2% (go be a doctor, you'll be rich they said, not!). We currently make ~6k combined in payments toward student loans but have discussed potentially paying minimums this year (~3k combined) to student loans in order to maximize down payment saving and get into a house sooner then make up for it when I get my pay increase to full salary. 

We realize this means taking a hit on interest over time but feel it's a price we'd be willing to pay to get our life started sooner. Aside from living at home for the next 5 years to pay student loans before saving up for a house, is there a smarter way to do this? We are already planning to refinance our loans through a company like SoFi here shortly and have held off on buying new cars, watches, etc :'(. Looking at you /r/watches for tempting me so much.

* Goldman Sachs is reporting that 50 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with the strongest balance sheets outperformed stocks with the worst balances sheets for 6 straight quarters – Goldman defines a “strong” balance sheet as one which is not highly levered and suggesting rising interest rates are the main driver behind the outperformance of this “factor”

Just looking for some PF advice for my near future.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

\-Current grad student (graduating May 2019) and National Guard officer (2LT with 8 years) waiting to leave for training (also May 2019)

\-Graduating with no student loans but will have $5k left on my auto loan at that time (1.99% APR)

\-Will have a steady income for the approximate 15 months I'm in training but then I'll have to secure a job

\-Unfortunately my savings has dwindled due to paying the rest of my tuition not covered by my benefits

\-Already contributing to my TSP (federal 401k) and will keep doing so throughout training

&amp;#x200B;

Plan:

\-Get the rest of the auto loan paid off

\-Get my emergency fund back up to a realistic value (I can only estimate living expenses after training)

\-Start saving everything else for a house sometime after I get back

&amp;#x200B;

Am I on the right track or would someone recommend a change or different approach?

###Goals  
####3-Year
* New Car
* Move out of State

####5-Year
* Another new car
* Owning a house
* 2nd child 

###Planned Changes 
These are changes I'd like to make based on my own assessment of our finances.  

* Increase Emergency Fund to $19,500 (6mo. Minimal cost of living)
* Increase monthly Savings contribution to $950 (houses are expensive)
* Move savings and emergency fund to Ally Savings (1.85% APY). Maybe keep some in money market for easy access.
* Be prepared to adjust as cost of living will go up with child expenses, so we likely won't be able to save or pay off debt as quickly as planned here. 

###Specific Questions  
1. Should I switch from Roth retirement investments to pre-tax?  
2. I recently spoke to my company's financial adviser, who gave me advice that does not align with much of the ""boglehead"" advice I've found on this subreddit. He has told me a few things about which I would like open and honest opinion.  
    1. He said half of our ""savings"" investments should be in a mutual fund so that they can accrue value and serve as collateral. I may be misunderstanding, but it sounded almost like, ""don't save for maximum money down on a house when you could have an investment portfolio that also serves as collateral."" How does this advice hold up and how does a portfolio as ""collateral"" compare to money down for a mortgage?  
    2. He said we should start investing before paying off debt. He said, ""why pay 6% interest on loans when you could get 10-12% from the market?"" I know that the general advice on this subreddit is to pay off all debt before investing beyond employer-match, but is there anything to his words? Could mutual funds be viable before debt is paid?  
    3. He generally expressed that my current investment strategy is too conservative and spoke ill of Vanguard. This left a bad taste in my mouth, but I want to be open to different perspectives. It seems that he prefers actively-managed portfolios and says that he wants me to ""become rich."" While I'm normally wary of such language, I'd like to remain open and hear other opinions about this philosophy and whether I should consider a different investment strategy.

personalfinance,Personal Brokerage transfer/withdraw woes,"Hello, 30/m here in US. Recent grad in the medical field working 2 jobs making $65k combined that comes out to less than $3k/mo after health insurance and deductions sadly.

I have $25k in a chase personal brokerage acct that was started for me in my name with $10k by a parent who is now deceased. I have limited understanding of how the acct works and after lurking here have resolved to use the money toward suffocating debts from recent life events. However, I understand anything I take will be taxed AND will be added to my AGI for the tax year. My problem is that I am in the PSLF student loan repayment program based on my AGI. The additional gains from taking $25k will skyrocket my monthly loan amount for a year. I am not worried about having to pay taxes on the brokerage account. I am concerned how taking the money affects my AGI and feeling like I have money I need and cannot touch. I am already lowering AGI with an HSA and 401k but the lack of cash has become a burden. 

What are my options?

1. Does this count as a windfall since it's a one-time thing and I can show proof to the federal student loan office of applying it directly to other debts?

2. Can I legally transfer the personal brokerage acct to a family member and have them immediately withdraw the money with the understanding of all of the above? I am in no way connected to the bank, stocks, acct, etc. Just a dude with money sitting in an acct.

3. I've read about gifting it to someone and there being a lifetime limit of over $1million. Is this a scenario to gift and then have a family member withdraw? 

Again, not concerned with the tax portion. It's the student loan/AGI balancing act that is crippling me. Please help and thanks so much. This sub has really helped me keep my head above water.",finance
personalfinance,How should I pay off my car loan?,"A little background after 3 years of living walking distance from work I got a higher paying job which forced me to get a car. I originally took over the lease of one of my parents car but I had to get my own car. I ended up deciding to go new and after dealer and employee discounts I got the car for $21,000. I make a little over $4,000 a month after taxes in which I use to save $1,600 a month and have a budget of $300 for a car payment. I also have around $50,000 in savings and investments. 

I originally planned to pay for the car entirely in cash but I was offered $750 cashback if I financed through the dealer. The issue is even after having a credit card for 4 months I still have a credit score of 0. So I was given an interest rate 11.85%! Still I took the deal and put $8,000 cash down for now. So I have a loan now for $13,000. Currently set for $260 a month for 72 months and would equal $5,000 in total interest. 

My plan right now is to pay $1300 a month which based on my calculation will have it payed off in 11 months and have the interest amount just over the cashback amount. This leaves me with being able to still put $600 a month into savings. I was told I need to make payments for 12 months in order for it to register on my credit report. Is this BS? Should I pay this off faster or is the amount of interest worth it for my credit report? Am I crazy or missing anything?",finance

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to get some thoughts. I currently have about $18,500 left in student loans (paid off from about $41,000 over 4 years). I'm curious if I should pay off a big chunk (like $10k) or even all my student loans. Additional info:

Currently have \~$28k in a high interest savings account (1.75%)

Loans have approximately 6% interest rate

Living expenses per month are about $3,500 (but also trying to save for big ""life purchases"" such as a house)

Actively pay $500/month to chip away at them and put another $500/month away in my savings account

No other debt (have some credit cards that I pay off completely each month)

Someone mentioned to me that paying off a chunk could hurt my credit score. I just wanted to see if there was anything else I should take into account before I make a decision.

I recently just passed my 90 day period in my new job and my work just connected me with a financial adviser that handles our retirement stuff. I spoke on the phone with him briefly today and he also sells disability and life insurance. I got a real ‘salesman’ vibe from it and it made me pretty wary. I wasn’t planning on signing up for those as I have no dependents, am relatively young and healthy, and I don’t have debt to pass on if I die. I also live in CA and I know we have a disability insurance program but I don’t know much about it. 
Today he pretty much just wanted me to ‘strongly consider’ the insurance options but I am going to have to finalize things with him this week and I’m sure he’ll pitch it again.

personalfinance,22 y/o looking for help planning for the future,"Thanks in advance for the help guys. 3 months ago, I started working in San Francisco after graduating from college.

* Base salary = $80,000; paycheck every 2 weeks
* Guaranteed February pre-tax bonus = $20,000
* Rent + utilities = $1,350/month
* Monthly take-home pay = $3,700

By my understanding, I'm currently on track to max out my annual 401k contribution (23% of each paycheck for $18,500 annually). My company matches 100% up to 4%. I am exclusively using the Vanguard Institutional Target Retirement 2060 Fund (total expenses = 0.28%).

Every month, I also deposit $2,000 of my monthly take-home pay into a Bank of America savings account that I don't touch (currently planning on using those funds for emergencies or something like an eventual house down payment). I use the remainder for miscellaneous living expenses, birthday presents, etc. When I receive my bonus, I plan on depositing whatever remains post-tax into the same savings account.

I am covered under my dad's healthcare policy until I'm 26, so I haven't devoted any money to medical insurance. I was also really fortunate to not have to worry about student debt.

The ask(s):

* How can I better position my finances for the future/retirement?
* Is my 401k allocation fine?  

   * Should I use additional funds outside of the 2060 Target Fund?
   * I only started contributing to my 401k with my second paycheck in July; is annualizing the right move, or should I up my monthly contribution to get as close to $18,500 as I can by the end of the calendar year?  

      * What effect, if any, would either have on ""maximizing"" my company's match?
* Should/can I also add to a Roth IRA?
* Is there a better way to safely put my savings to work, since the Bank of America account's interest rate is so low (0.03% APY)?
* Am I missing or misunderstanding anything?

personalfinance,Did My Old Job Take Out Too Much In Taxes?,"Right out of College I was hired by a small company that had only 6 employees, two of which were the owner and his wife. They offered a good deal for me at the time to gain experience and make more than my retail job was paying. They offered to start me out at $1,750 per month salary and then after 3 months I would get a raise to $2,050. That sounded pretty good and I took the offer. My first few checks rolled in and I wasn't too worried about how much taxes were being taken out as I was still making more than my previous job.

Then after 3 months, as promised, I was raised to $2,050 and I started to notice something weird about the taxes. At my previous retail job, I could almost count on having about 20% taken in both federal and state combined but here I was seeing around 33%. (taking home $1368 out of $2,050) I honestly thought it was a mistake on my part for thinking that 20% was what was needed to be taken out. I asked my grandparents in passing, who own a small business and do their own taxes, and without putting pen to paper they told me it sounded about right to take home $1,368. So I forgot about it and thought it wasn't that big of a deal. 

When I did my tax returns for last year I had to pay in for my federal taxes (~$200) even though the past 2 years of doing taxes I had never had to pay in and the only things to change was the company I worked for and the pay raise. Again I wasn't bothered by it and paid it and went on. 

Around mid-August, I started a new job as the last one was extremely stressful and I felt very unpaid for the position. At the new position, I make a little a bit more with my gross pay being $2,560/month(Paid weekly) but my net seems to sit around the $2,050/month, only around 20% is taken in taxes!

I know I may be completely wrong about all of this and it's just me not understanding the basics of how paycheck or federal and state taxes work. But a little more information is I have no dependence, didn't have any insurance or benefits, nor am I exempt from any tax. I am currently working on getting my benefits worked out at my new job so they will start soon. And I also know that I may not have all the information needed and will provide what may be necessary.

Edit: (Old Paystub)
      My Filing status was single and had 1 allowance for both federal and state.
      Medicare: $30
      Social Security: $127
      Federal: $404
      State: $120
      
      My main concern is that they may have been withholding too much without my permission. I am aware of the W-4 and how it determines 
      the taxes withheld. But I'm also kind of confused on is if they did withhold more then why didn't I see that in my tax returns last

personalfinance,110000k in student loans and a 70mile/day commute to work with no car - budget help wanted,"Hi guys, I want to know if I'm making the most out of my (very) small budget. So I get paid about 13/hr and after taxes my checks are about 1600/month. I get pain biweekly so 800/week and I spend 150/month on food and fun, \~650/month on a zipcar to take me to work in addition to 180/month for public transit. I use both transportation systems because its cheaper to split the trip 50/50 with zipcar commuter and public transit since I live 35 miles away from my job.

 My loans are still in grace period but I have federal and salle mae. I'll be getting a full time position sometime towards the end of the month which will make me a salaried employee but not making more than 40k/year.  Through the new salaried position I will be able to apply for a certain repayment method for my federal loans since I'll be a state employee which will allow me to only pay about half of my \~20k in federal loans over 10 years, barring I remain a state or federal or non-profit employee. My cosigner is paying interest on the salle mae loans until December at which point I'll have to pay 1500/ month unless I refinance (which I obviously will). This will reduce my monthly loan amount to about 750-800 depending on which lender I choose (or which lender accepts my \~680 credit score). 

Basically what I'm asking is 1) is this the best budget for me to have given the circumstances? 2) should I risk taking the hit to my credit score and having yet another loan to pay off a car for this extremely long commute (70 miles/day) or should I lease a car and add to my monthly payments without really investing in anything. Or should I take a small personal loan (so I don't drain my savings) to buy a cheap maybe 5k car and risk fixing it up more frequently. I do use Mint and PersonalFinance for budgeting and monitoring my investments, I do have a checking, savings, emergency find, and credit card account, one of which is a credit union.",finance

personalfinance,"Should I take out private student loans, or avoid them at all costs?","I guess the issue is, I’m unsure if the way I am handling paying for college is at all reasonable or not. Neither of my parents and almost none of my family has any experience with this, and we kind of went in blind; I’m now a college sophomore in a large city in the US, several states away from home. Moving away was on a bit of a whim, but I had always planned on moving to a city to pursue a career in media, and now I have built a life here (friends, clubs, SO, about to get on a lease) and am not considering attending school closer to home.

The issue is that for my first year of college, I had money left from a deceased relative who was very close to me. I lived on campus, had a meal plan, and between that money, several academic scholarships from high school and from my university, and two &lt;$2000 federal student loans, it was all paid for. I now live off campus, and work two jobs to pay my own rent/living costs, while my parents are paying for the gap in the tuition. They can just barely afford this, as my father is a truck driver in a supervisor position and my stepmother is a secretary (mother is disabled and has been unemployed 10+ years). Their cost is about $4500-5000 per semester. Both of them have terrible credit, and are only paying it themselves because we failed to qualify for any decent co-signed loans.

 I have been struggling to take care of my own financial responsibilities, and am currently living off of savings until I can find a new job. My parents tell me that, if they did not have to pay for tuition, they could help me with some of my rent costs. The stress of all of the uncertainty currently going on is affecting my studies to some degree. 

What I am wondering is: Should I take out a private loan, either in my own name, or try to find one that will accept my parent’s abyssmal credit? Is this a terrible idea when my parents *can* pay my tuition (even though its honestly probably decreased their standard of living by a lot)?

Or should I just bust my ass and be extremely broke for the next few years and graduate with way less debt? (If I graduate, because, again, I am currently far more concerned with keeping a roof over my head and not moving home mid-semester?)

I feel awful making my parents go broke for school when I could probably get some shitty loan, but their financial help would be far less of a strain if they were helping me with rent, not my tuition. However, my parents are also not the most reliable, and I worry they will tell me they will help me, and then leave me with no help for housing, and tons of debt when I get out - even if just because of their own poor budgeting. 

Is getting a loan big enough to pay some of the tuition and some of the rent a better idea?

I filled my W4 out the same way I did when I was married - I only claimed myself. Does a change in marital status change how much money is being taken out in federal taxes?

* the pre-tax maximum doesn't increase by more than 250$ (the running average yearly increase)

I will pass the pre-tax maximum in 2019. Obviously, for 2019, I want to do this, however what is my plan the following year? I can continue to bump up my contribution %, but it will just mean that my EOY paychecks will be larger or I could try to recalc and contribute the minimum % each year.

Obviously I will start redirecting the excess % into other vehicles (HSA, ESPP, ROTH) but this question is specifically about configuring my 401k

Is one choice better than the other? Is there something I'm missing that makes this question moot?

personalfinance,My story about finding a balance,"I’m going to start by stating that a lot of what I’m about to write goes against personal finances beliefs but feel like some people may enjoy a read about a happy medium between frugal and excessive spending.


During my undergrad I managed to get by with not spending much and was able to be debt free with a degree with scholarships, working and some contribution from my parents. My finances were great but I was unhealthy, limited socially, and unhappy. I didn’t want to spend much on food and it’s a lot easier to eat unhealthy cheaply than healthy. I liked the idea of having a girlfriend but girlfriends are expensive and not cost efficient, I managed to be okay with spending $10 a month on the gym but without a healthy diet a gym won’t make much progress. 


Grad school changed my whole life, despite having a car paid off and getting a scholarship for $10k a year I was still going to take out loans because grad school in the US is expensive even at Public universities. I decided a strategy of taking out the least amount of money I could to just cover rent and the remainder of tuition after the scholarship. This decision seemed great at the time but I suffered. Worrying about finances was stressful especially when you’re spending a majority of your day studying there’s just not that much extra time for a job, etc. I wasn’t able to get an iPad because it seemed excessive and just stuck to my laptop and printing out notes. I started going to the gym more because I was stressed out more often. At first I was worried about working but once I noticed other people failing from working + trying to do the school work I decided to leave my company and focus on school. I ended up with a 2.50 GPA my first semester and I almost failed a few classes. Second semester was slightly better but I still restrained on taking out enough federal loans. 


My second year in grad school I finally caved in and took out a more reasonable amount of money.  I spent on an iPad Pro and an Apple Pencil, started eating healthier and bought nicer clothes. My happiness improved dramatically. Got above a 3.00 both semesters, got a girlfriend, got a lot more attractive due to being able to afford a healthy diet. Despite going through one small period of unhappiness (about 1 month) I definitely did a lot more winning on my second year and I think this is partly due to taking out more money and not stressing as much on budgeting.


Over summer between second and third year I decided to do something about the loans so I found some work and ended up making about $8k in the green over summer even though I went on a few trips, paid back the higher interest loans.


Now I’m on my third year of grad school and I used a similar strategy to my second year but took out a bit more. Right now I’m sitting at an expected 4.00 in classes taken so far due to numerous factors such as discipline, work ethic, being healthy and partly because I’m just not stressing about money. Since I’m doing so well in school I’ve decided to pickup a job working about 10 hours a week and seeing if I can manage school + work so that I can travel more this year.


I’m expected to graduate with about $90k in debt when the average graduation debt for my degree being around $160k. Going to be going into a job making somewhere between $100-120k a year depending on the company I work for. Also going to be going out of school with a credit score around 790-800.



The point I’m trying to make with this story is that saving money is important but there comes a point where it can affect other aspects of your life. For me I started out super frugal, but I was unhappy, obese, cynical and limited socially. I’ve slowly progressed to a more happy me by caring less about money. I’m now healthy, super fit, have more friends, have a girlfriend, more well-rounded because I made the decision that saving money won’t define me. Balance in life is key and I don’t know where you’re at on the spectrum but for me being more closer to the middle of frugal and excessive results in a better  more happy me.",finance

personalfinance,"Trying to transfer $6,000 balance but only approved for $1,700","So I am currently buried in crippling credit card debt, I have a balance of $6,000 with a 22% interest rate on one card and $300 with 20% on another. I applied for another card in an attempt to get a 0% interest rate and luckily I was approved. However my credit line for that account is wayyyy less than my overall debt. There was a death in my family and I have $4,000 coming my way very soon and another $1,000 next month. I want to put it all towards my credit cards but I want to possibly avoid accruing more interest. I have no idea what to do or what my options are. Do I transfer the balance $1,700 at a time and just pay it immediately? Can I do that multiple times or only once a month?  Is that a terrible idea? Will this ruin my credit? 

I need some guidance please, I feel so lost and stuck and like an idiot for putting myself in this situation.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Breakdown,"Hello all,

I come to you with questions about student loan repayments, as I've seen many helpful responses from you all for others with similar inquiries.

Some background information: I have approximately $25,500 spread across 8 federal loans in outstanding student loan debt, all with slightly varying interest rates. The beak down for each of these loans are as follows:  
L1:  $1916.66 @ 3.76%  
L2:  $5074.43 @ 3.76%  
L3:  $2009.73 @ 4.29%  
L4:  $4990.21 @ 4.29%  
L5:  $2019.34 @ 4.66%  
L6:  $4070.51 @ 4.66%  
L7:  $2132.99 @ 3.86%  
L8:  $3292.98 @ 3.86%

As a general rule, I'm aware that it is most common to pay down those loans with the highest interest rates first (in this case L5 &amp; definitely L6). But as I'm going through the monthly interest payment associated with each loan, I notice that that some loans with lower interest rates generate higher interest payments per month due to their higher outstanding balances (for example, L4 currently has the highest monthly interest payment at about $17.84 \[{.0429/12}\*4990.21\]).

So my question to you all is this: if I am looking to pay down my loans in the most efficient manner possible, should I be paying down those loans with the highest monthly interest charges (L2, L4, &amp; L6) until the interest payments are essentially equal, or should I be ignoring that and simply focus on paying down the loans in highest interest rate order (L6 &amp; L5, L4 etc...)? Option three is just throwing payments at all the loans as a lump sum and paying them off that way.

Any advice you could give me about payment options or just debt repayment in general would be greatly appreciated! This is a wonderful sub and I love reading about personal finance success stories! Thanks in advance guys and gals.",finance

XRP,My Thoughts On XRP.,"Although XRP is the digital asset of RippleNet used to move money, I don't see a day that Ripple nor XRP will fall. There is talk about XRP being considered a security and it is currently being under review by the SEC. Logically a company would not advertise their technology aggressively and continue expansion knowing their digital asset is a risk of a different ruling. The fact that there is silence on the end of the SEC and increased activity on Ripple's end to promote their technology and company, eludes to the possibility a decision has been rendered. Furthermore, Ryan Zagone leading the Federal Reserve Faster Payments Task Force. Ripple had a goal which was to change the system from the inside out. They have put this into motion. For the U.S. to rule otherwise would be crippling especially with huge banks around the world already adopting their technology. Behaviorly, making other countries dependent on this technology, it becomes an inelastic good (i.e. gas because you need it to get to work, go anywhere, etc.) It would not make sense to disregard the impact Ripple has made and is going to make in the financial world. I think this quiet is just the eye of the storm. All the officials in higher places are staking their claim before mass adoption happens and prices skyrocket. I could be wrong but it makes so much sense to me. Please share your thoughts! I would like to hear what you guys think.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,I provided a debt collector with my bank account info...,"I was able to settle for 40% of a debt with the collector over the phone. He sent me a letter stating that once payment is remitted then the account will be settled and no more of the debt can be collected. 

I tried to use a prepaid card and for some reason that did not work. I was fed up with this taking forever so I just provided the debt collector with the account number and routing number to my bank account. He confirmed and had someone else confirm the total that would be taken out. This was set up for 2 days from now because I said I needed 2 days to pay it. He said give him a call when the payment goes through and he will send me a confirmation and receipt. 

Obviously given what I've read on the internet about never giving a debt collector your account info, I'm kind of nervous. Is ensuring that I have only enough in my account to cover this payment sufficient to prevent me getting screwed over?",finance
personalfinance,Am I understanding mortgage points and origination fees correctly? Are they worth paying up front?,"I'm applying for a mortgage and there are several options. For 0% origination fee and 0% points, I can get a 4.375% interest rate on a $340k loan. But, for 2.25% points and a 1% origination fee, I can get a 3.75% interest rate. That would save me $44,271.68 over the next 30 years at an upfront cost of $11,050. Now 30 years is a long time, am I better off to pay a higher interest rate and invest the 11k? Or should I minimize my interest rate?",finance
personalfinance,Cash-out refinance of one home to purchase + develop another?,"Hi r/personalfinance,  I've got an important question for you!  

&amp;#x200B;

I have an existing duplex which I purchased + renovated.  It has an FHA Loan w/ a 3.5% interest rate, + PMI insurance.  The monthly payments are about $2,150.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering a cash-out refinance to a conventional loan which will allow me to pull out an estimated $75k in cash for a potential development.  The refinance would drop the PMI insurance (we'd keep 20% equity) but the estimated payments would increase to about $2,650.  

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of this would be to develop another property as a 2nd rental property (3 units) 9mo from now.  I'd put 5% of a $900k development fee down (which we'd get from the refinance) using a Home Style Renovation Loan w/ an interest rate around 6.25%.  The ultimate rental income would be about $8k/mo + the approximate value of the property would be around $1M - 1.1M conservatively.  This mortgage payment would probably be almost $7k/mo.

personalfinance,Did I just fall for a student loan forgivness scam?,"My mother works for a school system and was given information about a certain company that would forgive student loans for school employees. 

Thinking this was a good idea, my mother contacted this company and was then contacted by the manager and owner of said company. After a lengthy conversation regarding personal finances, she proceeded to give the man both of our personal information; including full social numbers, and her debit card info when he asked for 6 months payment

She heard about this program through a employee assistance service provided by the school system she works for.


After googling this person's name and the company listed in his first email; I found 2 other companies in his name that are shady at best. He sent a docu-sign document to be signed electronically, which sparked our concern, as she thought he was affiliated with the federal gov.


My questions are: 1) How badly did we screw up. 2) What can we do to correct this? 3)  What should my mother do with regards to her bank (since she gave him her debit card linked to her checking account.)


I was not made aware of any of this until she finished speaking to the man on the phone tonight. I'm a little freaked out that he has our social security numbers. Any help would be awesome, thanks!",finance
cybersecurity,"Business/Management Background, looking to get in to Cyber Security/Networking","Hi all,

I've been a lurker and you all seem like a good bunch, so I figured I would ask here. 

To keep the background short, I'm recently unemployed by my own choice. All the jobs in my area require some type of Program Management or IT background. I almost decided to get my BS in Cyber Security a few years back, but went for Business Administration instead. I'm now about to enroll in an undergraduate certificate program for cyber security and should have it by May 2019. 

I was a GM of a business and did well, but it wasnt for me.  So I left to try something else, but got bamboozled and now I'm here. What kind of positions can I apply my management and business admin skills to the cyber security field (once I get my certificate)? I like working in teams and working on a couple different things then moving on to something else. A project manager feels like it would be best, but I know you have to have some background to get that role. I'm really just wondering what kind of positions there are in the cyber security/IT world (generally) that require business and IT skills. 

I live around a lot of federal agencies with lots of vacancies, most of which are for program/project managers or IT related. 

Thanks in advance!",technology
financialindependence,retiring Military E-8 tell me what you think...,"This is a throwaway account because I'm dealing with numbers.

Retiring from the military after almost 26 years at E-8. I'm married with 3 kids and plan on using the GI Bill for their college. (everyone is not cut out for college)

Now here's the numbers $319K in stocks, $59K in a Roth IRA and $223K in cash to put on a down payment for a house. This will bring my house payment under $500.00 a month.

My thoughts are that my retirement will be around $45K a year $**38K after federal/FICA tax** with at least 50% disability which is about an extra $11K a year bringing the total to about ~~$56K~~ $**49K** a year. For the last 15 years my family has been able to live under this amount so I don't think I will have to utilize my stocks in retirement unless we want to make a big purchase.

The reason why my investments is 100% stock is because I view my retirement payment as equivalent to bonds.

I will be living in a LCOL area in a state that doesn't tax military retirement.

My goal is to not have to work unless I want to not because I have to and to work at something that I enjoy doing.

So now I need you all to tell me what I didn't account for.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: thanks to  [funobtainium](https://www.reddit.com/user/funobtainium) for the direct comparison with her current E-8 retirement pay which made me take a closer look at the numbers.

personalfinance,Should I take company contribution to student loans or just pay them off ASAP?,"I have a total student debt balance of just over $21,000 spread across 6 loans with an average interest rate of 3.9%. I began paying the debt off in Jan 2018 and paid off my highest interest loan first ($18000 at 5.1%) 

My company is offering a student loan assistance program giving $6000 spread over the next 5 years. This contribution will cover the entirety of the accrued interest each month and a small amount of the principal for each loan.

Do you think I would be better off taking the full contribution over the next 5 years, making the minimum payment each month and using that money to max out an IRA instead?

Or should I just continue pounding the student loans and forfeit the $6000 company offering? 

My only other debt is a car lease at $164 a month with 8 months remaining and I’m currently contributing 8% to a 401k which my company matches 50% along with a core contribution of 4% of my income. 

I will gladly give more info if needed, just trying to avoid making this post too lengthy.

personalfinance,Pay off car loan?,"I have a good chunk of change stashed away, and just took a job making $10k/year more plus a potential ~$15k more in budgetary bonuses, which I have no doubt I will make. I've never not made budget.

I have been wanting to buy a house, but my good old student loans combined with my car loan are holding me back from being able to get a mortgage.

I owe about $21k on my car, which I can pay down at once and still have a decent amount of cash left over just in case.

Given how I spend, and my new pay, I would be able to recoup all of the cost of paying down the car in about a year, assuming I make MOST of my bonuses. That time frame would obviously shrink if I make ALL of my bonuses.

Given the high interest rate on my car note (5.95%) vs the low interest rate on my savings (1.5%), it seems best to pay it off now and take the hit on my savings given the difference in interest rates.

Is this the right move?",finance
personalfinance,Should me and my fiancé purchase this house.,"For context we have 35k saved. We were trying to live with our parents for one more year and save another 30k combined. We were looking to buy a house at 300k and put 60 down to avoid Pmi. 

Recently a house came to our attention from a family friend. They own the house and used it to rent the upstairs and allow one of their friends to live downstairs at a very reduced rate. The friend has since moved on and the family friend is deciding they want to move away and no longer want the property. They wish for someone close to be able to get the property and aren’t looking to go through realtors so that both parties save about 20k each. 

The problem is that the house appraised at 400k which is 100k over our optimal range. There is a second floor tenant who rents the upstairs and is willing to sign a 2 year lease with the new owner. So me and my fiancé would live in the bottom floor 1 bedroom which doesn’t bother us as we don’t have any kids for the time being. 

The way it would work is we pay 35k as a down payment which is less than 10% so not ideal. We could put more when the time comes but we want about 10k in savings in case the renters don’t pay which In my line of work seems to occur enough to be an issue. 

Here’s the way it shapes up with a 5% interest rate(may be able to go lower with my credit union or somewhere else)
Mortgage-2400(with pmi) 
Taxes-700
Utilities-500(unsure)
2 car payments-750
Food and other expenses-500
Student loans-250
Total expenses are 5100

Income after taxes- 4500
Rent-2700
Income with out rent we lose 600 a month
Income with rent we make 2100 a month to save for a future home so we can get our own place and keep this one and rent both floors.(first floor rent was valued at 1500+ so 4200+ for both) 

Without the rent this isn’t an option and it’s another reason we are waiting. I’m due for a 10k raise in June and even though it’s a government contract i don’t Count on anything unless I read it on my pay stub so I’m not factoring that into any future calculations. 

I have a pension but I also commit 12% of my salary to a differed comp system which I could stop for a few months to help with money but that’s a last resort as I’d like to keep my contributions steady.

Between the two of us we also make another 1-2k a month doing side jobs but since they fluctuate I don’t want to consider them a factor in our decision.

Lastly the house has a new roof and aside from some cosmetic things we would like to change at some point it’s move in ready for us and the tenant is already there and isn’t asking for any renovations.

Any advice on why or why not this is a good move would be greatly appreciated. It’s a good investment but is it a good investment for us at this stage.",finance

Bolton asserted Monday the court “threatens American sovereignty and U.S. national security interests.”

&amp;#x200B;

The Netherlands-based court said in a statement Tuesday it was established by a treaty supported by 123 countries. It says it prosecuted cases only when those countries failed to do so or did not do so “genuinely.”

&amp;#x200B;

The court pledges to “continue to do its work undeterred, in accordance with those principles and the overarching idea of the rule of law.”

&amp;#x200B;

Bolton’s speech came as an ICC judge was expected to soon announce a decision on a request from prosecutors to open an investigation into allegations of war crimes committed by Afghan national security forces, Taliban and Haqqani network militants and U.S. forces and intelligence in Afghanistan.

US threatens to arrest ICC judges over war crimes probe

Washington will sanction and prosecute ICC judges who open an investigation into US war crimes in Afghanistan, said a top official. In November, the ICC chief prosecutor requested a probe into criminal action by the US.

DW.com 10.09.2018

&amp;#x200B;

US National Security Adviser John Bolton on Monday threatened to sanction and prosecute International Criminal Court (ICC) judges if the tribunal attempts to charge US service members and intelligence agents with war crimes.

&amp;#x200B;

""The United States will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court,"" Bolton said in a speech delivered to the conservative Federalist Society in Washington.

&amp;#x200B;

""We will not cooperate with the ICC. We will provide no assistance to the ICC. We will not join the ICC. We will let the ICC die on its own. After all, for all intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead to us.""

&amp;#x200B;

The ICC responded on Tuesday to Bolton's threats, stating that its work would not be influenced by Washington in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

""The ICC, as a court of law, will continue to do its work undeterred, in accordance with those principles and the overarching idea of the rule of law,"" the body said in a statement. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ban, sanction, prosecute

&amp;#x200B;

In November, ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said there was a ""reasonable basis to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in connection with the armed conflict in Afghanistan"" since the US-led invasion in 2001.

&amp;#x200B;

Bensouda said a ""meticulous preliminary examination"" had led her to ""the conclusion that all legal criteria to commence an investigation have been met.""

&amp;#x200B;

But Bolton said that if ICC prosecutors attempted to do so, the US would target the international court's judges.

&amp;#x200B;

""We will ban its judges and prosecutors from entering the United States. We will sanction their funds in the US financial system, and we will prosecute them in the US criminal system. We will do the same for any company or state that assists an ICC investigation of Americans,"" he said.

&amp;#x200B;

ICC prosecutors asked for the court to open an investigation into alleged war crimes carried out by Afghan security forces, Taliban and Haqqani militants as well as US troops and intelligence forces who were in Afghanistan since 2003. The US personnel are accused of illegal imprisonment and torture. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rights groups slam 'authoritarian' threats

&amp;#x200B;

The US announcement was swiftly criticized by human rights groups, with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) saying Bolton's threats were ""straight out of an authoritarian playbook.""

&amp;#x200B;

 ""This misguided and harmful policy will only further isolate the United States from its closest allies and give solace to war criminals and authoritarian regimes seeking to evade international accountability,"" the ACLU said in a statement. The organization represents several people who claim they were tortured and detained in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2008.

&amp;#x200B;

The Human Rights Watch said that any attempt by the US to thwart ICC investigations ""would demonstrate that the administration was more concerned with coddling serial rights abusers — and deflecting scrutiny of US conduct in Afghanistan — than supporting impartial justice.""

&amp;#x200B;

International justice

&amp;#x200B;

The ICC is an international tribunal tasked with bringing to justice perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. More than 120 countries are signatories to the Rome Statute that established the ICC, including Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

While the US had initially been a signatory, it later withdrew its support for the institution. Although former US President Barack Obama at times cooperated with the ICC, his predecessor, George W. Bush, and his successor, Donald Trump, remained critical of the body.

personalfinance,Take a 0% student loan to invest in mutual funds?,"Before anything else: I’ve searched Reddit and other forums to get an answer to this question. However, even though there are a lot of topics covering student loans, I couldn’t find a single topic on 0% interest loans. That said, let me continue. 

Thanks in advance for taking your time to help me out!



Hi,

Let me tell you something about my current situation first. I might stray from the point, but I want you to form your opinions not solely based on financial point of view (which seems a simple equation), but also based on my personal situation. 

I just started my 3rd year in University. The last two years I didn’t do good in personal finance. Better said, I did horrible. In the last two years I got myself in €20k of student loan debt for no legitimate reason (just to be clear, I spend all of it and didn’t have any of this money left in savings).  I was hooked to the materialistic life I could ‘afford’ using my student loan. I bought myself a car and spend lots of money on... nothing. 

Three months ago I started turning things around. I became more aware of the fact that I am the only one responsible for my own future. If I wanted to become successful in life, I had to make changes. Drastic changes. I stopped loaning money (actually I did this a few months before this point); I sold my car (this was my biggest expense); I started tracking my income/expenses and made myself a budget. Changes were not limited to personal finance. On top of the changes already mentioned, I managed to get a promotion at work (40% salary increase) and got clean from weed. 

I did very well the last months, I’ve saved around 40% of my income (note that I used spend 200% of my income). I became more interested in personal finance as I read Dave Ramsey’s Total Money Makeover (first book I’ve read in 10 years or so). This book is about getting out of debt and to financially healthy life.

I initially wanted to immediately start paying off my student loan (already did a few small payments). However.... I am starting to doubt whether this is the best approach in my situation. I could, instead of saving on my income and use it to pay of my debt, invest my money in mutual funds (since these require little expertise) even using my student loan to do so. Let me explain why:

Living and studying in the Netherlands I am offered a 0% student loan with a maximum loan of €1000/month. This interest rate is not expected to change in the near future. After graduating the interest rate will be fixxed for periods of 5 years (the current coalition has plans to change this into periods of 10 years). I don’t have to start paying of my student loan untill two years after my graduation (4 years from now) and I can make unlimited extra payments whenever I want. This allows me to cash in my mutual funds and pay of my debt in case the interest rate would unexpectedly increase.

What do you advise me to do:

-save on my income and pay off my student loan

-save on my income and invest in mutual funds

-save on my income and use student loan to invest in mutual funds.

I am very interested in your opinions and advice. I will take it as advice only and not hold you accountable for any consequences.",finance

personalfinance,"Leaving a job 6 months after relocating for a ""better"" position?","Please forgive me if this isn't the right subreddit, but my financial situation falls into this as well.

To give you background, I am 22, I work for a retail company in a relatively niche industry as a ""store manager"" though I technically have three stores under my management. About 6 months ago I was moved from a small town in Illinois to a much bigger metro area with a booming job market. I'm making 35k a year and have reasonable insurance, and I was also given a $2,000 check to move (after the C.E.O. told me $3000). 

Right now my work life is incredibly hectic, I'm salaried and working at least 6 days, 50 hours a week with no overtime pay or bonuses. All three of my stores are understaffed when I'm not working I'm on call 12 hours a day and am frequently called upon to come in and fix situations. I've been trying to hire more help, but entry level retail is just not a hot career choice and I am not getting anyone that lives up to my companies standards for $9/hr. 

On top of all of this our industry is under fire by the FDA right now, online sales are dragging retail sales down, and it doesn't seem like this company is doing much to fix any if this. I moved out here for a company I really loved, a job I really enjoyed doing, but now I dread going into work every day. This job is taking all of my motivation and fire away from me.

I've worked as a manager for this company for over a year, and was a store manager for the previous company (I was aquired in a buy out) for 2 years before that. I've moved twice for my career, and have relatively solid work experience for my age. I've been looking around at other jobs and I'm finding sales, marketing, and similar positions I meet the requirements for that pay around the same if not more to what I'm making now. 

Is it wrong to leave a company not even a year after I moved to help them out in a troubled market?

TLDR: I feel like work is slowly burying me and taking away all my free time and motivation, love the people I work for but I'm worried about my position and sanity. I moved for the company 6 mos ago with a bonus but no ""relocation to package""",finance

personalfinance,Is it a bad idea to open two lines of credit in the same week?,"For some background, I had an excellent credit score (over 800) which recently went down to about 770 for 2 reasons:

- I paid off my car loan, so that account was closed
- I asked my mom to remove me from a credit card I shared with her since college. I’ve never used it, but her transactions and credit limit we counting toward my score, and while she’s financially responsible and I trust her implicitly, I’m almost 30 and wanted to separate myself from that. 

So, this last week has been a doozy. I had my wisdom teeth removed ($600) which I anticipated, but then had $900 in unexpected car repairs and $3500 in unexpected vet bills for my cat who had a medical emergency. I put $2500 of the vet bill on a Care Credit Care.  They needed 75% up front to do the life saving procedure, so I didn’t have a lot of time to consider options and knew that I could get approved for Care Credit on the spot. I have 6 months to pay off that $2500 interest free, which I can do. 

So now I still have $2500 on my regular credit card, interest rate 10%. I was thinking about opening another line of credit with a 0% interest rate for an intro period (12 or 15 months) and transferring that balance. 

Is it a bad idea to open another line of credit when my score has recently taken a few hits from paying off my car loan and opening the Care Credit card?

Also, I can afford to pay the full $5000 outright today, but it would take an enormous chunk of my savings that I’ve been building for years. 

Any advice on what I should do?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 30 years old, live in Southern California, have a job in public service and currently have a base salary of $90k, and make around $30-40k/year in overtime (for now, not always guaranteed). My salary is going to increase $5k per year for the next 3 years, by 2021 my base will be $105k. I use Mint as a budgeting tool, I feel like it help, but I admittedly could still be a bit tighter when it comes to my budget. I have an emergency fund set up, and I currently max out my 457(b) Deferred Compensation at $18.5k/year in Roth contributions. I have a vehicle payment of $508/month with approximately $30k left on the loan at 2.49%. This is my only debt. My next major goal in life is to own a home, which will more than likely be a condo or duplex (I feel a house is unnecessary for a single guy, plus the price of houses here are very expensive).

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be beneficial to pay off my vehicle loan ASAP, then continue to put money away for a down payment on a home? Or with such a low interest rate, is it smarter to continue to save and reach my goal that much more quickly? I just don't like to have debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be advisable to put less money in my 457 in order to save for a home? With my maximum contributions, I only take home about 50% of my gross. Keep in mind that I also have a public service pension in addition to the 457.

&amp;#x200B;

We live on the central coast of California. This is a pretty high cost of living area.

We net between 6.5k and 7.5k a month. Depending on hours worked. With 5% raises yearly (for the next 4 years) + cost of living raises

We have a pension and contribute matching amounts of deferred comp and put a little in a IRA and have pretty good healthcare.

Credit scores are above 780 for both of us.

Have 80k in cash. Plus emergency fund.

Only debt is a $500 a month car payment. (14k remaining due. 2% interest rate).

No CC debt, no other loans.

Kid is in the near future. So the income will drop 1k a month temporarily.

We live pretty frugally. Our biggest expense next to car insurance and food is cell phone. We also take a long time making financial decisions, which is hard for us to decide on a house when 90% of homes sell within a week or two of being listed.

We love traveling and usually go on a couple trips a year and would like to continue having a decent amount of money budgeted to entertainment.

We got pre qualified for up to $675,000. Which is way above what we want to spend. But a 2 bed, 2 bath small home costs about 350,000 - 400,000. with 3 bed and 3 bath homes costing between 400,000 and 600,000. We don't want a condo or town home with HOAs. Which does remove some options on the cheaper end.

A 2 bed will only last us a few years with a kid, so that rules out the 2 bed homes.  We are wanting to stay between 5-10 years at this house and hopefully ""upgrade"" in the future depending on the market.

I have used the calculators and looked into the % of income rules, but just wanted to ask on here to get an idea of what others think.

We can put 80k down, but that would leave us with little to 0 savings other than the emergency fund. That makes me nervous. 50k (which would be around 10% down) would make me more comfortable to save some liquid cash in the bank.

I think I know where we stand with what we want versus what we should get. ie saving more and getting a worse house or spending more and being more house poor.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts or advice is greatly appreciated. I know this sub likes to tell people to spend way less than we are thinking  here, but there are no homes around that can have us spending only 10-20% of our income on a home like a lot of people on this sub.

250 for payment on current loan

200 current credit card minimum payments (125 for mine, aprox 75 for his)

400 for food

150 for car insurance

250 for gas/parking

50 for phones

90 for dues

For a total of 1945


Our gas costs go down If only one of us is working and i have a 1k emergency fund to cover small gaps if need be, and if we were both unemployed and absolutely had to we may be able work off some of our rent (we are living with my dad while we get our finances in order).



Does the personal loan sound like the best option? I am nervous about charging the medical bills, having all of our credit maxed and being up to our ears in minimum payments. Even though I dont think the new loan payment would be much less than the other payments total, having it be consolidated and not messing up our credit seems like a benefit to me.


Any help would be greatly appreciated!

financialindependence,"[Book Summary] - I finished up Rich Dad, Poor Dad and summarized it in case anyone wants a refresher or hasn't had a chance to read it yet. Here's the summary.","*This is a transcript for a video summary, so please forgive any grammatical issues :).*

&amp;#x200B;

**ABOUT THE AUTHOR**

Robert Kiyosaki is in the businesses of real estate and intellectual property. From what I've gathered, he's made his money primarily through purchasing rental property during recessions and then creating IP such as books, games, and seminars to share some of the best practices he's learned throughout his journey to financial independence.

&amp;#x200B;

**SUMMARY**

Robert begins by explaining how **""Proper physical exercise increases your chances for health, and proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth.""** So keep doing what you're doing right now and continuously educate yourself. To become wealthy, your education cannot stop once school ends. That is when the real education begins, and it's up to you to define your curriculum. Most people don't.

He then dives into the six main lessons that were imparted upon him by his Rich Dad.

&amp;#x200B;

**FIRST LESSON:** **The rich don't work for money; they work for assets.**

What he means by this is that the rich don't spend their days going off and working for a paycheck that they then use to merely cover their expenses. They spend their time and money building and accumulating assets, and minimizing their liabilities. We'll define these a little bit later but an example of investing in assets is exactly what you're doing right now - self-education. A theme throughout Robert's book is that **your mind is your greatest asset**, so you ought to invest in filling it up with stuff that will make you money. He borrows from Edgar Dale's Cone of Learning to explain how reading and lecture without any action are the worst ways to learn something; you need to exercise your knowledge by sharing it with others and actually doing the thing that you're studying. **Action is what educates, not passive consumption.**

Robert talks about how, you need to **monitor your emotions, don't react to them**. In order to monitor, when you feel emotions like frustration or anger or anxiety, delay your reaction, take a breather, and ask yourself, why am I feeling this way? What's the solution? How do I move forward at the lowest possible (time/money/emotional) cost?

He says as emotions go up, intelligence goes down. This has actually been demonstrated to be true in scientific studies and has also been demonstrated to be true in my life.

Robert then asks the reader: What's an example from within your life where you reacted with your emotions?

\[Personal paragraph\] I reacted with my emotions when I decided to purchase my condo. After deciding that I wanted to live in the Los Angeles area, I came out here and rented an office space to live in because I wanted to live downtown Los Angeles without signing a lease because I was shopping for a home; I also didn't want to pay over a grand for an airbnb and I wanted privacy. So I rented out a month-to-month office in a highrise for $800 and lived in it while I looked for a condo to purchase. I had a great view but it was a bit cramped… I was getting tired of sleeping on an air mattress and decided to stop waiting for perfection and just buy something ""good enough"". If I had waited, I probably would have been able to find a better deal. But it was my frustration and impatience that drove that decision.

&amp;#x200B;

**SECOND LESSON:** **It's not how much money you make, it's how much you keep.**

Robert explains how If you want to be wealthy, you have to be financially literate, and to become financially literate, you must study. Something to keep in mind is that most of the people out there driving really nice, new cars and living in really luxurious homes with designer clothes are not truly wealthy. Their lifestyles have inflated along with or even beyond their income - which is not where you want to be.

Someone can be highly educated, professionally successful, well-dressed and have all the trappings of opulence, and still not be able to survive for a very long time if they stopped working. And that's the truest measure of wealth.

Where you want to be is living far below your means and focused on building a foundation. A big part of that foundation, Robert explains, is Accounting. He begins by defining assets and liabilities.

**An asset is something that puts money in your pocket.**

**A liability is something that takes money out of your pocket:** [**https://i.imgur.com/7HZSM9o.jpg**](https://i.imgur.com/7HZSM9o.jpg)

He explains how a poor person generally has income that is used only to pay expenses such as rent, taxes, food etcetera, with no assets or liabilities; just bills.

Then he shows how someone in the middle class generally spends their income on liabilities that they believe are assets, but really aren't - like a mortgage on the house they live in, or a car loan, or credit card debt, or school loans.

Finally, he shows how a wealthy person just has assets generating positive cash flow to cover their expenses. This is the sweet spot that you want to work towards.

Typically what happens is people experience growing expenses as their careers progress - in the form of bigger and better cars and homes, mortgages, kids, hobbies, or maybe medical expenses. **This leaves no margin to invest in the development or acquisition of assets:** [**https://i.imgur.com/omJDVGh.jpg**](https://i.imgur.com/omJDVGh.jpg)

I think we can apply this concept to time and not just money.  ***Invest*** **your time to build assets, don't just** ***spend*** **it** hanging out and shopping and indulging: [https://i.imgur.com/BS7JAyJ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/BS7JAyJ.jpg)

Robert advocates adopting a rule of thumb - **only indulge in additional expenses with cash flow from your assets:** [**https://i.imgur.com/aes6PQn.jpg**](https://i.imgur.com/aes6PQn.jpg)

**It's also important to surround yourself with people who are constantly learning, growing, taking risks, trying new things out, and maybe failing, but relentlessly trying.** These people will form the collective foundation of your mindstuff, and that mindstuff ought to aligned with your goals.

&amp;#x200B;

**THIRD LESSON:** **Mind your own business.**

Robert explains how the rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements.

Another perspective on this is explained in another of Robert's books called the Cashflow Quadrant, where he explains how there are four ways people make money: Employee, Sole Proprietor, Business Owner, and Investor.

**Employee** – Desires job security with limited risk. They pay the highest tax rate. This is Poor Dad.

**Sole Proprietor** – Is their own boss. Their income is tied directly to how much they work and if they do not work, they don’t get paid.

**Business Owner** – hires employees to delegate as much as possible. They systematize their business so it will put money in their pockets even if they stop working.

**Investor** – Makes their money work for them.

So, what I would say is - don't chase raises and promotions within your company to fund lifestyle improvements. Chase assets that will anchor you away from that Employee quadrant. Promotions will only help you become more financially secure if the additional money is used to purchase income-generating assets: [https://i.imgur.com/11M3q7V.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/11M3q7V.jpg)

He also argues that **if you don't love what you're investing in, you won't take care of it**.

&amp;#x200B;

**FOURTH LESSON: The power of corporations**

Another way that the rich make their money work for them is by allowing their wealth to protect itself from taxation in the form of corporation. These corporations are nothing more than legal documents that register a business entity with the government. These documents then allow the owner of the corporation to spend his money before being taxed.

&amp;#x200B;

**FIFTH LESSON: The rich invent money by taking action**

Robert explains how **It's not the smart people who get ahead, but the bold.**

Land used to be wealth and still is in many ways, but Robert emphasizes that information is the truest form of wealth and that bold utilization of that information is what gets you ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

**SIXTH LESSON: Work to learn: don't work for money**

What he means by this is that in your choice of a profession, seek work for what you will learn and try to select something that will give you skills you can use to build assets. When considering leaving one job for another, don't just think about its impact on your income. Think about its impact on your ability to load up your asset column with new skills, experience, or connections.

He wraps up by explaining the three types of income - The key to becoming wealthy is the ability to convert earned income into passive income or portfolio income as quickly as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

**SUMMARY**

The book paints a picture of the conventional earner - someone who endures a formal education that stifles their creativity and passion in favor of obedience and employability. This person generally gets a job, stops learning, and trudges through the gray lockstep of being a salaryman, without ever thinking there's an alternative, an escape.

There is, and that begins with developing your finest asset - your mind. Once you have your salary, treat your job as a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Either focus on earning more from your job so you can invest your money into asset acquisition, or focus on optimizing your available time to invest in asset creation. If you choose the latter, you can optimize your utilization of time through habits, routine, exercising for the sake of mental health and productivity, and working remotely to eliminate commuting and office distractions. This way you can fatten up the time you have to *invest* \- and not just spend.

Don’t allow your lifestyle to inflate until you have assets to fund that inflation. To build these assets, read. Explore. Experiment. Take risks. Try, fail, and try again. You'll inevitably discover an intersection between your passions and market opportunities as you learn how to identify them, and you'll have built a foundation of knowledge and experience to capitalize upon your calling when you are ready and able to hear it. But know that nurturing the growth of this foundation takes consistent action over the course of years.

Your job is a means to an end, and that end shouldn't be death; it should be freedom. Now I haven't quite figured out how to pull this off but I do believe in it whole-heartedly and I'm trying to unravel my passions, and I think we all should.

I think an interesting exercise to further explore this discovery of your passions is to imagine a fully automated, classless world, A world where goods and services are provided by robots that run on renewable energy and everyone gets whatever they want whenever they want it for free - how would you spend your time? What would give your life meaning if the construct of employment no longer exists? Write down what comes to mind and then think about how you can build assets related to that thing.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY IMPRESSIONS OF THE BOOK**

It's important to keep in mind that this book, like all other books, is a product intended to generate high return on Robert's investment, or ROI. So throughout the book, there's a lot of ""cross pollination"" - pitching his other products to the reader. It's both a product generating passive income and a sales channel pushing readers to more of his products and services.

Robert is extremely capitalistic and while admirable, his pride and hunger for more do show, but the core message was thought-provoking and well worth the price of the book. He has a web of cross-pollinated IP products that have served him well, but be mindful of this so that you're not exploited. Be a skeptical defensive consumer; I found the wikipedia article on him to be interesting - ""He is subject of a [class action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action) suit against him by people who attended his high priced seminars and has been the subject of two investigative documentaries by CBC Canada and WTAE USA.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kiyosaki#cite_note-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kiyosaki#cite_note-11) Kiyosaki's company filed for [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy) in 2012."". This isn't all that surprising given the exploitative mindset he advocates in the book, but try to separate the sort of greasy ethos from the positive, actionable insight if you decide to pick the book up.

As far as the actual read - it's very easy to read and it gets you thinking, which is great. The raw material in this book is valuable and at the end of the day, the format he chose got millions of people thinking about personal finance. So I think the net impact on both broad and individual scales is positive here.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE BOOK'S IMPRESSIONS ON ME**

I literally today saw someone post a note on my condo's bulletin board trying to rent out two of the parking spots that they aren't using. I live in Long Beach California which is in the process of gentrifying so there isn't much demand for parking spots in this condo right now, but I think there will be in the future, so I called her up and offered $1000 to buy both spots. She said she needed one of them in December so I told her she could rent one of them for the $50/mo she was renting them for, and she said ok. I've acquired my first true asset, and I acquired it by doing something a little out of the ordinary, all thanks to this book.

This is just a starting point. Personal finance is something you'll want to research extensively on your own, and it may sound boring or daunting, but one weekend spent learning about this stuff could earn you years of financial independence so just suck it up and dive in. It's worth it.

If you aren't sure where to begin, here are a few things I've learned through years of making mistakes:

Start early - the difference between starting in your 20s and starting in your 30s is ridiculous. Compounding interest is extremely powerful: [https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/27/nerdwallet-charts-show-the-power-of-compound-interest.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/27/nerdwallet-charts-show-the-power-of-compound-interest.html)

Avoid consumer debt. Stop buying things that you don't need. Don't use your credit card to buy something you don't have the cash for; use your credit card to build credit.

Live as far below your means as you can to create as big of a gap as you can between income and expenses.

Take full advantage of tax-advantaged investment vehicles like employer-sponsored 401(k), Roth IRA, HSA accounts.

Don't use your HSA; you're better off paying with cash because your HSA funds can be invested and any realized gains are not taxed if they're used to cover past or future medical expenses.

MY only real expenses are a gym membership and some music, tv, and book services.

Ugh. I'm rambling I guess trying to rationalize my own spending. Anyway heres everything:

Credit cards\~ 2.1k

Medical bills\~1.8k

After rent, bills, and transportation I have about $200. And that's for day to day spending toiletries, soap, groceries, etc.

I've been making minimum payments on everything and a little more when possible but the interest makes it impossible to lower the balance on my credit cards. I was doing okay for a while and completely paying of my credit cards every month but things got out of hand.

Should I consider a consolidation loan with an awful, high interest rate. Or do you think I could tighten my belt and pay this off somehow? I mean my interest rate, given my credit score will end up costing me 2k. Is it even worth it?

personalfinance,"$15/hr, $160k in student loan debt","Hi guys, I am posting this for a close friend who is in an ***extremely*** dire situation.

They went to school for 2 years, dropped out due to personal reasons and decided they couldn't finish. Racked up about $160k in loans - $13k federal around 4%, and $140-150k in variable rate private loans (out of state, expensive school and program, young adult decisions with no perspective or guidance).

They now live paycheck to paycheck working 35-37 hours a week at $15/hr in an office with no real upward mobility. Their bills come out to about exactly what they make after tax (about $1900 monthly). They have an extra $2.5k in debts with no interest.

It has been 2 years and they have obviously paid nothing. Some of the private loans are starting to default. Credit is probably sitting at 300-400 at this point. They haven't made an effort to renegotiate (yet - I advised this).

I sent them a bankruptcy firm that does free consultations. Told them to simultaneously meet with an attorney and call the private debtors to try and renegotiate, as the latter will go far in their bankruptcy case.

Reading about the [Brunner test](https://www.natlbankruptcy.com/how-can-i-tell-if-my-student-loan-debt-is-dischargeable-in-bankruptcy/), it is unclear whether they have a shot. Private student debt in this country is a shit show.

I am also open to hearing other options. I have suggested they return to school at some point, but I think it is more pressing at the moment to get this debt wiped if they can... because they will be in the exact same situation after finishing an undergrad degree. They wouldn't be making anywhere close to attorney/medical doctor income.

PF, need your help on this one.

However, I also need a car, and don’t want to blow the savings I’ve built up on it, which means I’ll need a loan. My question is, should I apply for the credit card first, before the auto loan adds to my debt?

personalfinance,"Past NY state (and federal) taxes questions: questions on reducing penalties and interest, what to pay now, etc.","I am finally at 95% percent completion with my tax fiasco.  I am finishing up tomorrow and want to make sure I don't make any mistakes at the end that will cost me.

**Background**

I was an independent contractor in 2012 and did not do my self-employment taxes correctly.  In July I received a notice for a warrant from NY state (the first I had heard about this) for the back taxes.   The original amount due was around $1800, with penalties and interest it is now around $3800.

To add to this, NY State has no record of me filing 2010, 2012, 2013, or 2014.  I have paper copies of my Federal for those years.  I have no idea, but whatever.  I never filed 2017 (I knew they owed me money.)  

I finally got an accountant and he gave me my final numbers today:

State: 

I owe: 2010 $262;  2012 $1305; 

They owe me: 2013 $492; 2014 $421; 2017 $442

Federal: 

I owe:  2012 $310

They owe me:  2017 $4157

NY State Tax Collections office said to call them once everything was filed and they would set up a payment plan/amount for me to pay before collections start **October the 5th**.  I have been saving money all summer so I can pay this off all at once.

**Questions**

1. I always hear people say that they negotiate their taxes.  My ideal situation would be to pay them in full immediately for the taxes I owe and they wave the interest and penalties.   However, the last guy I talked to in Collections said everything was determined by ""the computer.""   Is the billing/collections the people to talk about this to?  The audit department?  How do I go about negotiating?  What if they say no, that I still owe them $2000 in penalties/interest, is there another way to try to reduce?

2. My accountant is filing 2017 electronically.  I have to mail in the previous years.  When I talk to Collections how can they see the conclusions for 2012 if they are in the mail, won't it take them weeks to get it?  They said to call them the minute they are ""submitted"" in order to set up payment.  Do they just take my word for now?  (I also don't know whether to put in checks with the envelopes or wait and pay online.)

3. My accountant has me owing for 2010 State taxes.  This is odd as I have never owed taxes when I worked a just a regular (non-1099) job.  I always claim 0, but he can't see what I claimed that year.  Wouldn't I have heard from them if I owed for 2010 if they are on me about 2012?   So if I file that I owe them, but they have no record that I do, what happens?

4. My accountant has me owing a bit more for federal for 2012.  I filed for 2012 and have a record of it.  I am pretty sure I already paid what I owed a few years ago.  He says I owe more now that he added deductions?   It seems like it should be less.  They seemed happy with what I gave them, but I don't know where to find the record of this.   I don't want to re-file the Federal 2012 (no one asked me to), but he said they may just come after me in a few years.   

That is pretty much the summary.  I am not sure if I am even asking the correct questions.  Tomorrow is the day everything will be finalized so I don't want to have any loose ends.  Thanks so much.",finance

personalfinance,"Starting medical school in a year, what are my options for paying off a car loan?","I currently work weekends for ~11 hr while in undergrad and have a car loan that’s 7,000. It has a 23% interest rate, and a monthly payment of $256 plus $150 for full coverage insurance. I’m going to work my ass off during the winter and summer breaks to try to cut into that, but most of my checks recently have been going towards my interviews. Is there a smart way to try to pay this off before or during medical school, or is there a possibility for a deferred payment/refinancing option that would be better? I just feel like that additional $400 a month (and that 23% interest) on top of other living expenses would be an unnecessary amount to add to my loans.

I have approx. 35k in student debt (fixed with 5.3% average rate) and 16k left on my truck (3% interest) and she has 45k in student debt (4.6%) and 5k in personal loan (15%). Right now we bring in a combined income of about 6k/mo but she has potential for some overtime.


We recently bought a house (I know this isn't normally advised pre-marriage and until debts are paid, but house is in my name and we looked at all factors and owning is cheaper than renting in our market). Mortgage, taxes, insurance and utilities averages at $2000/mo.


My truck payment is $360/mo, our min. student loan payment is $780/mo, her personal loan is $300/mo. Food is approx. $400/mo.

She is putting as much extra money as she can into her personal loan and I'm putting as much into my highest interest rate student loan as we can afford right now, but it still looks like 10 months before we pay those 2 loans off (this frees up $400/mo in cash flow).


I have money saved for a ring already, and I refuse to go into debt for a wedding (we will likely pay for most of it ourselves). It seems like the rate that we are going right now, it will be 3 years before we can afford a decent wedding (if we pay off the loans we are currently working on, then pay minimums and save everything for the wedding). I can feel the frustration in my SO that marriage/family plans are being pushed back due to aggressive loan payments, but she understands we just can't afford a wedding or babies right now.

CryptoCurrency,Federal Court Finds that Virtual Currencies Are Commodities,"Washington, DC — On September 26, 2018, Senior Judge Rya W. Zobel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, entered an order holding that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has the power to prosecute fraud involving virtual currency and denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss the CFTC’s amended complaint.

CFTC Director of Enforcement Comments

James McDonald, CFTC Director of Enforcement, commenting on the ruling, stated:  “This is an important ruling that confirms the authority of the CFTC to investigate and combat fraud in the virtual currency markets.  This ruling, like the one in McDonnell from Judge Weinstein in the Eastern District of New York, recognizes the broad definition of commodity under the CEA, and also that the CFTC has the power to prosecute fraud with respect to commodities including virtual currencies.  We will continue to police these markets in close coordination with our sister agencies.” 

Summary of Order

Agreeing with the CFTC’s arguments, the Court held that the CFTC had sufficiently alleged that the particular virtual currency at issue, My Big Coin (MBC), was a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) because the CFTC alleged that MBC “is a virtual currency and it is undisputed that there is futures trading in virtual currencies (specifically involving Bitcoin).”  According to the Court, the term “commodity” “includes a host of specifically enumerated agricultural products as well as ‘all other goods and articles . . . and all services rights and interests . . . in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.”  The Court specifically agreed with the CFTC that “Congress’ approach to defining ‘commodity’ signals an intent that courts focus on categories—not specific items.”  The Court found that ‘[t]his broad approach also accords with Congress’s goal of ‘strengthening the federal regulation of the . . . commodity futures trading industry,’ . . . since an expansive definition of ‘commodity’ reasonably assures that the CEA’s regulatory scheme and enforcement provisions will comprehensively protect and police the markets.” 

The Court also rejected Defendant’s argument that the CFTC’s anti-fraud authority over MBC extended only to fraudulent market manipulation, holding that the “broad language in the statute” “explicitly prohibit[s] fraud even in the absence of market manipulation.”

These holdings are consistent with the decisions obtained by the CFTC earlier this year in the case of CFTC v. McDonnell in the Eastern District of New York (see CFTC Release 7702-18, March 6, 2018; CFTC Release 7774-18, August 24, 2018). 

The order arises from a CFTC federal court enforcement action charging defendants Randall Crater; Mark Gillespie; John Roche; Michael Kruger; My Big Coin Pay, Inc.; and My Big Coin, Inc.; and relief defendants Kimberly Renee Benge; Kimberly Renee Benge d/b/a Greyshore Advertisement a/k/a Greyshore Advertiset; Barbara Crater Meeks; Erica Crater; Greyshore, LLC; and Greyshore Technology, LLC with commodity fraud and misappropriation related to the solicitation of customers for the virtual currency MBC. 

The CFTC’s amended complaint alleges that since at least January 2014, the defendants operated a fraudulent virtual currency scheme in which they solicited customers to purchase a fully-functioning virtual currency, MBC, by repeatedly making false and misleading claims about its value, usage, trade status, and financial backing.  As alleged in the amended complaint, Defendants lied that MBC could be bought, sold, donated, used to make purchases, and was actively trading.  To give the illusion that MBC was a safe bet, Defendants also lied that MBC was backed by millions of dollars in gold, and would be used to stabilize the economies of twenty-two countries, as alleged in the amended complaint.  The amended complaint also alleges that Defendants misappropriated customer funds by conning people into giving them more than $6 million for what Defendants represented was a fully-functioning virtual currency.  Defendants allegedly used these misappropriated funds to purchase a home, antiques, fine art, jewelry, luxury goods, furniture, interior decorating and other home improvement services, travel, and entertainment.   

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties, restitution, rescission, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, trading and registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the federal commodities laws, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement and CFTC Virtual Currency Task Force staff responsible for this case are Traci Rodriguez, Jonah McCarthy, Patricia Gomersall Hillary Van Tassel, Dan Ullman, John Einstman, and Paul Hayeck.

personalfinance,Scrap or repair car with blown engine?,"My husband drives a 2012 Chevy Cruze with 125K miles, and we found out today the engine is blown. We owe $2800 with a 2% interest rate. Monthly payments are $190. We could replace the engine with a new one that has a warranty for 3-4K or buy a used engine and have it put in for $1500-$2000. The car is a piece of shit to be honest, it's covered in hail damage and the transmission blew at 75K miles but was replaced under warranty. It gets great gas mileage and we intended to drive it until it died and I didn't worry about paying it off early because the APR is so low. 

We live in a condo that's paid off and have been trying to buy a house all year but it's been one huge financial hit after another. I owed a bunch at tax time (small business) and I am cash flowing a 2nd bachelor's degree (in CS) and my tuition is 15K a year. Our dog was diagnosed with cancer in August and had testing + surgery last month to the tune of $3500. 

I am trying to decide if I should pay off the car and then scrap it and buy another car or if we should pay to repair this one and keep driving it. (I would have to finance but could get a low interest rate.) These cars are notoriously lemon-ish but I had hopes of keeping it long term and going without payments for a while. I feel like the used engine option although cheaper might just be inheriting someone else's problem. 

Other relevant info- our combined income is around 100K a year-take home pay is 6K a month. No mortgage/rent. I have a car payment of $400 a month on a 2016 Subaru and still owe around 14K. Interest rate is also 2%. I pay about $1200 a month in tuition. Total monthly expenses are around $3000. We plan to buy a house soon with a mortgage payment around $1200 a month and are also trying to get pregnant so daycare will be an additional $800 a month. Within the next year we should receive a 30K income increase when I switch over and begin working in the CS field.

personalfinance,"Mortgage company violated the law, costing my $7,250 over the life of the loan.","First, I am at fault for not properly informing myself about everything that I need to know about a home mortgage. Bottom line, that's on me.

Here's the deal. My mortgage company received a ratified sales contract on early 9/21/18. I received a form email stating that I would be contacted in 48 hours. I did not hear from anyone until 9/26/18, an hour after the Fed increased their rate. 

It was at that time (late on 9/26) that I first learned I was required to specifically request that my rate be locked. I wanted to get that rate set at the time of requesting a pre-qual, but was told I couldn't lock until I had that ratified contract. I left with the impression that it would be automatically locked at that point. 

Apparently, there is a regulation (CFPB, trid?) that requires contact/documentation within three business days and my mortgage lender admits that they violated this law. When I finally was contacted I immediately locked my rate and this triggered a document dump (the first documents I received aside from pre-qual letters) that explained everything I did not understand, but at a point when that knowledge was no longer useful.

The result is, the interest rate jumped after their legal requirement to contact me expired and they say I'm stuck with the higher interest rate. They say that even though they broke the law, I'm still stuck with the natural outcome of breaking that law.

personalfinance,"Hitting a wall with student loans and graduate school, not sure where to turn.","Hi all, hopefully this fits the submission guidelines, I know there are a ton of other student loan posts here, but I think each case is pretty unique. Without further apologetic remarks, I'll describe my situation below:

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a private, 5-year undergraduate institution and took out both federal and private loans to cover tuition costs (I paid roughly 50% of the total tuition thanks to a scholarship). Still I racked up about $110,000 in student loan debt with the highest loan at 10% interest and the lowest at 6.4% (across 5 loans). This was just for my Bachelor's degree in environmental science. 

&amp;#x200B;

After graduating I moved to abroad for a year under a fellowship and put those loan in interest-only payments for the duration. My federal loans are under income-based repayment (currently $0.00 a month). After coming back, I enrolled in a PhD program in Biology at another private university that pays for my healthcare, tuition, and associated fees. I receive an annual salary of $33,000 dollars (not including taxes) which comes out to about $1,072 biweekly. My rent is currently $1,008 for a small basement apartment that I share with another student (Yay northeastern cities!). Utilities except for cable/internet are included ($25.00 a month additional). I have no car, and typically my only costs are food and toiletries (I don't eat out ever, or drink because of trying to save money). I do have a medical condition that requires extensive medication and supplements (probiotics, vitamins, etc) that averages about $80.00-$100.00 monthly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I now owe just around $120,000 in student loan payments that are currently in forbearance, but will end at the end of this month. Monthly payments are projected to be around $1,500, which obviously I cannot afford. I have been rejected for loan re-consolidation from multiple lenders (even with a cosigner income of $90,000). One lender will not allow me to do an in-school deferment, and I have to be approved by the other for in-school deferment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could consider petitioning my program to allow me to work a second, night job despite the psychological strain this would put on me. I don't really have any service job skills that would allow me to pull in tip money at a higher end establishment which is a problem. Honestly at this point I'm worried about having to give up this apartment and potentially drop out of the PhD program to take up a really full-time job or two to make those monthly payments. I am planning on calling both lenders tomorrow to see if they have income based repayment plans, but I'm not too hopeful. Best case I can imagine is paying on interest for eternity which is at least something.

***Question:***

I want to access the equity I've built in my house in the last two years and use it to renovate my house extensively. The cost of renovations is unknown at this early stage but I expect to spend in the neighborhood of $50,000. Let's assume this number is fairly accurate as I remodel homes for a living and I've done some napkin math. I'm 27 years old and I know a little about mortgage refinancing, HELOCs, and second mortgages, but I'm not sure what the optimal play is here and hoping for some advice from someone who knows the ins and outs of home loans. I'm considering my options currently as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1.) Refinance. My original loan provider does not have any free refinance programs etc. so it would cost me the full service fees etc. to refinance the home. I think I can do this at 80% LTV which leaves me with a maximum of $79,114.89 I could take out. In doing the refinance I would eliminate Post Mortgage Insurance which is an instant $122.02/mo savings. I then have no monthly payments towards interest on borrowed money other than my new home loan. Problem is I lose my amazing interest rate of 3.25% and swap it for \~5%.

Option 2.) HELOC. I'm not familiar with these much at all, it's like a giant credit card but with a more reasonable rate as I understand it. This doesn't solve my PMI problem though.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3.) Second Mortgage. Someone told me that I should look into taking out a second mortgage, taking out enough money to pay down my first mortgage enough to get rid of PMI and then I could keep the lower interest rate on my first and only have the higher rate on my second. Sounded good to me, however I think someone else told me that because my initial loan is FHA First time home buyer, I can never get rid of PMI from the loan unless I refinance to conventional.

&amp;#x200B;

***Summary:***

So I guess I'm just looking for some advice here. Which option should I take, or maybe a combination of options perhaps? Maybe there are options I'm not even aware of, I just don't know and there is so much advertising and spam related to the mortgage industry online it makes it really hard to research specifics.

personalfinance,Got rehired at a firm and am kicking myself in the ass a year later about the salary I agreed to.,"A little background - Started working for a construction management firm in my sophomore year of college as a paid intern. Busted my hump through school and they sorely needed some younger driven employees. I kept getting increased responsibility and relatively conservative raises for 2.5 years until I got fed up with how much I was responsible for and how little I was being paid. I asked for a review and got a very nice dinner and extremely long praise from the owner and VP. Come time for the actual salary discussion and the needle barely moved. I got fed up with being shit on because I am young and put in my notice that I was leaving. I worked at another company for 6 months and hated the job I was doing and texted the old company asking if they would entertain discussion on rehiring. They were through the roof happy and gave me an offer that day (decently higher than what I was getting paid when I left)

Now what I should clarify here is that construction managers in my area (New York - not the city) make very good wages. Superintendents (my position all along) make anywhere from 75-120 depending on experience and project managers make anywhere from 100-150+ 

So anyways, got rehired at about 74k as a superintendent. Immediately was assigned to a TREMENDOUS project (over $20M) in a school district. My boss (project manager and VP) had no time to dedicate towards my project because he was nursing other superintendents. We’ve had several discussions and he acknowledges time and time again that I am working so far above my head and blah blah blah. I went in for a mid July review and got a 7500$ bump. I had no chance to negotiate or make my case for more money. I was promoted to “Assistant Project Manager” along with 5 others in the company (of 40 superintendents).

I had a very successful summer program and completed all the work that was slated without any help from my boss whom is technically the project manager. I feel like an ass walking in there and basically asking them for at least 110K but realistically based on how many hours and how stressful and skilled the job is, that is the minimum amount that should be paid for the same. I’m at the point now where I am sharpening my resume to go fish for other offers. Any idea on how to approach this dramatic raise? Or best tactic for backup?

TLDR; company is manipulative because of my age even though I am a top performer. I am being paid WAY less than a competitive wage and am looking elsewhere. Need advice.",finance

My problem with the game isnt the game itself its the people playing it. 2 players who are clearly griefers by names &lt;blank&gt; and woron griefed players with tanks and spawn killed them over and over. Though the games been out less than a month the fact these cheaters are still there is sad.

I can say their names because they chose ones that are hard to find due to being very common( i went through 40 pages to find and report them to no avail. The devs dont seem to notice despite being a small studio. This kind of behavior should worry them if thats how people will act.

In all the game itself is sound and well built but the player base is less than 50 people and typical server no more than 17 players, most common is 6. Having cheaters run a muck is a quick way to kill that tiny player base off. I dont get why players feel the need to act this way, they dont get anything usuful out of it except for the enemies they make and the bans they get.

i even voiced this on discord where the devs are. Its been 2 days and nothing from them.

Is that worth putting majority away in the 401k (and a portion in regular checking for ""big purchases"") rather than trying to pay down the relatively low interest loans?",finance

personalfinance,"laid off, expecting large severance check but company won't allow me to contribute any of it to 401k. Any options?","I was laid off recently and am expecting a severance check equal to 3 months pay.   Googling ""what to do when getting laid off"", I came across a Forbes article which says one should max their 401k % contribution, to try to get as close as possible to the max ($18k + $6k ""over 50"" catch up).  

&amp;#x200B;

I did that, but my (former) company has a ridiculous policy that it takes 2 pay cycles for the new 401k % values to take effect.  Furthermore my company says that the severance check is not considered W-2 wages, so the new 401k %'s won't apply :-(    This means I'll effectively end up paying approx $3k extra in federal income tax that I won't be able to recover

. 

Additional relevant info:

 \- married, filing jointly.  Wife is already maxing out her 401k

\- wife has a high deductible health care plan, and is already maxing out her HSA contribution

\- our combined incomes for this year will be slightly above $200k, which makes a traditional IRA not a viable option.

personalfinance,Should I put a lump sum into my student loans before or after refinancing?,"I just made an extra $12k from stocks that I was planning to put all towards student loans.  Currently I have a 5.615% fixed interest rate at about $79k debt in total.  I have plans to refinance for a second time and as I know of I can shave down my interest rate at the very least about .75%. I was wondering if I should put this lump sum into my loans before or after refinancing.  My reasons thinking that I should do it before is that maybe my lower balance might get me a better rate for the refinancing.  Is this something they take into account?  Or should I refinance first, get the lower interest rate, and then deposit my $12k?",finance

personalfinance,Growing emergency fund vs paying off Student Debt,"Hi all,

I'm 24, and I have been able to save a decent emergency fund ($18K, about 9-10 months of expenses), and now I'm thinking it might be time to get ahead of my student loan debt ($22K, all Federal loans between 3% and 5%). My monthly student loan payments are a manageable $250. Is my emergency fund too large, and should I consider other savings before paying off the debt?

Other relevant stats:

**Monthly Post-Tax Income**: $2600

**Monthly Expenses:** $1600-$1800

**Retirement Savings (403b):** 12% unmatched employer contribution (~$400/mo)
****

Thanks!

Edit: My savings are in a 1.85% interest savings account

Edit 2: Hi all, thanks for the feedback.

What I'm thinking of doing is paying off my student loan with 5% interest (currently $9.2K), and then applying that $120/mo payment towards additional retirement savings. All other loans are 3%, and with my current savings rate I would probably be able to get ahead of those in the next year or so.",finance
personalfinance,Consumer Credit Union interest taxed at end of month?,"I tried searching through the sub but didn't find an answer. Google seemed to yield some answer but I want to make sure.

I recently opened up a Consumer Credit Union account to try out the higher interest and to store my emergency fund, and last month was the first time I hit the 3.09% interest. I took a look at the bank statements today and noticed the interest is lower than I expected. I did the math, and it's about 22% less than what I calculated, which I suspect is the income interest? Googling seems to suggest that if the interest is categorized as a reward, then it might be automatically taxed.

Can someone who holds the same account verify if this is true?

Edit: Another question, assuming this is the income tax, I'm not in the 22% bracket. So when the bank gives me the document to hand in for tax return, would I have to adjust it to my bracket?

2nd edit: so I was wrong in my calculation. Called during my break to ask. I thought that the interest would be calculated as 3.09%/12 months for each month.  What I didnt know was it went 1 step further and calculated per day too. So there were some days that I didnt have my funds in the account yet. This will account for the lower interest rate. 

Thanks everyone for the feedback !",finance

personalfinance,Raising a Credit Score + Best Way to Buy First Car,"Hello, all!

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started making positive changes on my credit score. Beginning March 2018, I started working with a free non-profit credit agency. They helped my consolidate old credit card debts, payday and installment loans. They packaged this as a credit builder loan, where I pay them a set amount per month and they report to all 3 credit bureaus. The outstanding debt is paid in full as well. I opened a secured credit card ($200) limit, and 3 unsecured credit cards ($300, $300, and $500.). I have no balance with these cards, and my utilization stays under 20%. I also have old late payments to Fedloan from 2015, ( 90 day and 120 days). I have had over 2 years of on time payments since then. My score was at 569 for TransUnion and Equifax around march 2018. They currently sit at 649 and 573. I just looked at my Experian score which is 613. I have a student loan balance of 11,000 and 830 left on the credit builder loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I want to have a 700+ score that I can use to open a credit card I really want.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, within the next 8-12 months I want to but my first car. I'm a 26 year old female with a first year diver's license. I have  no savings for this just yet and I wan keep my payments as low as possible. My monthly income is about 3k per month, 8 months out the year, then it dips to around 1.5-2k.  My monthly obligations total around 1.7k give or take a purchase. not sure what to expect or how much to save for a car.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: My Monthly obligations just changed dramatically, I lived on my own until last week. My boyfriend and I live together now and split almost everything 50/50. I also auto save $60 a month to a savings account with my work's credit union. Due to a major theft recently I had to empty this account, it has $100 in it now. I plan on getting my auto loan through them as their rates are better. The threshold for 2.99% with them is a 650 credit score.

A quick question about tax withholdings. I am a public school teacher. Last year, I had 1 or 2 withholdings listed on my W4 (I am married, not sure if I had chosen 1 or 2 though). We ended up owing a lot of tax at the end of the year, so I decided to change to 0 withholdings. It was our understanding that this would cause more tax money to be withheld, so we would not be hit with a big bill come tax season. 

However, since I switched (April 2018), I have had about 20% less federal income tax withheld. Medicare and OASDI went up very slightly. I live in a state with no state income tax.

Have I done something wrong? I just don't want to owe a ton in the spring.

financialindependence,How can we improve?,"Getting married next week and want to see how people think the wife to be and I are doing and what we could be doing better.  I know we are doing solid overall as we are both financially responsible but I want to make sure we are doing the proper things to be FI as early as possible.  My reasonably achievable goal for us is to hit a million and be comfortably FI before we are 45 so about 15 years.  I turn 30 in about a month and she's a few months after that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Status**

Wife is a teacher at a private institution making very low 50's.  Call it 50k a year for simplicity.  I am self employed and my income is variable.  For simplicity we will assume I only make 50k a year but it's usually more than that.  So we will assume a combined 100k a year, everything else we make past that from our incomes is gravy that can just be auto invested in mutual funds.  It appears with current fed/state tax that about 20k a year is lost to taxes on 100k so we will take home about 80k/yr until the brackets change (not factoring in that we will save some from pretax 401k investments and other small things).

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Assets**

\~70k cash

\~50k equity in our condo

\~10k crypto

\~52k fidelity taxable acct all invested in FSTVX

\~5k vanguard invested in VTSMX

\~4k in some teachers retirement thing when she was in public schools

\~15k in roth IRA all invested in FSTVX

\~16k in an IRA BDA all invested in FSTVX

\~13k in 401k in mostly VIGRX

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Liabilities**

\~137k and 29 years left on mortgage at 3.5% (condo worth around 190k)

\~14k on car loan at 2.5% (car worth around 17k)

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses**

We spend roughly 45k a year, let's call it 50k to be safe because unexpected things like car fixes/house fixes/medical expenses aren't included in that.

\------------------------------

**Our Plan**

So basically worst case scenario on our income and expenses each year we expect to save 30k, potentially more and are currently at about 240k net worth.  About 110k of that is invested in retirement/brokerage accounts almost 100% in mutual funds.  Our goal is basically to at minimum max out her HSA, 401k, and two roth ira's each year invested in FSTVX/VIGRX or similar.  Even at a very conservative 5% return over the next 15 years that brings us to just over 1mill net worth by the time we are 45.  We will have most likely one but potentially two kids at some point in the next 3-5 years but I am hopeful that we would still be able to save 25k+ once having a child.  Wifes job would get us half off daycare programs and we also have grandparents that are fully retired and would be able to help here and there.

&amp;#x200B;

Are we doing what we should be doing to reach our goal?  Are there smarter things we can be doing in terms of where we invest the money?  Most of our expenses are necessary and not cuttable (mortgage/insurance/etc), we could cut a couple thousand a year going out to eat less and buying a few less things but ultimately I think we lead a reasonable life that is enjoyable and upping our savings by 2-3k a year wouldn't be worth giving up these cuttable things.  

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for any advice on how to improve our investment strategy.

personalfinance,"Considering bankruptcy, I don’t see any other options. ~$35,000 USD total debt. Bulk of info in description. Long, lots of detail.","25 yr old, live in East Montana. I lived in Minneapolis from Jan 2012 - August 2017. I was a full-time student for 3 years, accruing ~$15k from credit card debt to pay regular bills, and ~$20k from federal student loans. The credit card debt is spread out between 3 cards and a personal debt consolidation loan. 

So long as I lived in Minneapolis, I could make payments and was doing fine, figuring I’d finish with a degree, a career path, and be able to pay off my debt (like most American students do). All aspects of my life fell apart in the space of 3-4 months leading up to me moving back home last August. I lost my girlfriend of 2 years to someone else, found out I needed another year or two of school to get transferred to my school of choice due to a terrible advisor putting me on a bad path, and lost my landscaping job. In short, everything was fucked, so I moved back home to try to reset. I floated between jobs for a couple months, finally landing with the one I have now. 

I make $1,600 a month, and after working here officially for ~6 months, the only “assets” I have are those I brought back from Minneapolis, a ~5 yr old macbook, my car, my phone, clothes, and the minimum furniture needed to live I’ve purchased since. The highest possible value of absolutely everything I own is ~$3,000 including all furniture, clothes, etc.. $1k for car (dying, has 155k miles, transmission is starting to go), $500 for laptop, $500 for phone, and $1k for furniture, clothes, etc.. 

Total expenses a month are about $1,300 with rent, phone, utilities, food, car repairs/insurance (alternator died, timing belt needed swapped, etc), and not including any debt payments. 

Mentally, I’ve struggled with suicide for the past year, and can’t even really afford help there. I’m considering bankruptcy to help financially at least a little, as I don’t see any other options. There isn’t a better paying job for me around here, a part time job isn’t feasible due to a non-set schedule, and I can’t take the phone calls, letters, emails, any of it anymore. Idk what to do or who to ask.",finance

I did sign something - I may have only skimmed it and I was definitely a few glasses of wine deep.

I have existing 529 plans for two kids (one in HS and one just starting college) that need to be re-allocated and I have a recent windfall that i want to place in it (state is VA that has state income tax deduction).  I do not use the age-based plans due to higher expense ratios, rather use the individual passive index funds (mostly Vanguard) and re-allocate as needed.  I'm a little behind moving to lower risk funds.

The standard allocations for their age include bond fund (VPMX), but given current performance (down for the year) and rising interest rates, should I avoid this fund and just go with a lower risk option (stable value, money market, etc.) for both?

personalfinance,Fighting credit card debt... need advice.,"Sorry I understand its abit of a read, thanks for understanding and taking the time to read through it.

Tl;dr skip to the asterisk for my debt and financial income. 

To start off, I was taught credit card management by a coworker, and managed to keep it pretty well(around 780). 

A while back we found out my mom had cancer (she beat it!) And I decided to pitch in as I'm the oldest son and my father was struggling with the Bill's after insurance.  

About a month or so another suprise hit my family, me and my wife were having a baby! So 9 months of doctor visits and preparations led to a beautiful baby girl. All the while I was struggling to keep paying the credit cards, when my wife got pregnant she was stressed at work everyday so we decided to have her stay home and relax.

My wife now stays home full time and while it's nice to have her watch the baby, missing out on her income hurts financially,  I understand babysitters might cost a decent bit so I'm not sure which is more worth it.

*
The grand total I'm sitting at right now is 12,734 dollars in credit card debt with no other debts in other forms and no savings to speak of.
(I have been throwing everything I made towards the debt, and it still increases.)

Our Bill's per month include (an estimate for me, my wife, and baby)
Groceries.        $350 (including diapers and formula)
Car insurance $245
Car payment.  $251
Rent.                 $1210
Internet.          $79
Electric.            $141
Phone.             $140
Gas.                  $100

Which puts us at $2,516 per month without paying towards the credit cards or interest.

Credit card wise we owe
Chase - 2,088.24 at 20.74%apr
Amex  - 5,991.94 at 29.99%apr
Discover - 3,304.98 at 20.74%apr
Capital1 - 1,871.24 at 26.49%apr

With just minimum payments, I'm looking at another $385 per month
Each interest rate equals out to around $273 per month

So all and all I'm looking at $3,173 per month with an average debt pay off rate of 2-3 years, right?

My biggest issue is that Im a chef and I make roughly $1200 a check, every 2 weeks. 

How would you guys go about settling this credit card debt as fast as possible?
Is a loan a good option? Perhaps going for the amex first would work? Or maybe I should try to renegotiate my apr and see if they wont lower my rates.

It seems that the interest rate when some of the bonds were purchased was only about half a percent so I was wondering if there is some sort of investment I can put those towards that has higher rates of return.

personalfinance,"The old ""10/1 ARM vs 30 yr fixed"" question with a twist","Usually, I'd agree with previous posts on this sub that state that a 30yr fixed at today's interest rates wins almost every time between the two. 

However we've found a lender who's 10/1 ARM comes with the added benefit of no PMI if you have at least 10% down. We had been planning on paying only 10% down as our rent has been climbing higher than a mortgage payment.

Online calculators say it would take about 6 years of normal payments to pay off PMI, so that could be a savings of $5-$7k+. Of course if our rate jumps after 10 years and the housing market goes down or we don't want to sell, the rate increase could make us pay all that back in less than 2 years. 

At the same time all that savings could be applied directly to principal and we could come out massively ahead if we sell sooner.

personalfinance,I think I'm finally on the right path,"Hey everyone, I hope you all had great weeks.

I wanted to tell a quick story and gauge this subs' thoughts on it, so bare with me on the long post and thanks in advance for reading it!

Background: my current debt I believe is about $12,000, all in credit cards or personal loans. It started when I moved to a big city in the northeast immediately after college after spending my first 22 years of life in a medium sized town in Texas.

Needless to say, the cost of living difference was a shock and I never truly got over it or adapted to it. I moved there for work after getting a good job in a high profile industry that would surely open up a lot of doors for me, which it has. The issue is that, while the industry is high profile and opens doors, the pay is awful AND I only got paid monthly. It was super difficult to budget for a full month and I never really figured out how to do it. I was also young and in a new place and wanted to go out and have fun and meet new people and have nice things. I wasn’t rational about my spending habits by any means.

This was a typical monthly timeline for me: I would get paid (again, once per month on the last business day), pay my rent and bills and then have a really good/fun weekend and basically be broke for the rest of the month, which is where the credit cards came in. I started out with just a couple of small ones that had about $300 limits.

After living there for five years and basically doing that same song and dance every month despite getting bonuses and pay raises along the way, I finally had enough. I tried to pay off my debt with consolidations, discipline, etc., but didn't succeed.

I suppose this is where the optimistic part comes in. I recently took a job back in Texas that pays better, has better benefits, and is still in a really good career field with a lot of advancement opportunities. I'm living in a big city and opted to live in the city to be near friends and other young people rather than in the suburbs, which I realize isn't ideal for someone who is trying to get out of debt. I analyzed it and justified it for mental health aspects. Being far outside of town would have made my commute 1-2 hours, which would have added a lot of stress to an already stressed person, and would have made seeing my friends regularly much more difficult. I signed a one year lease and am open to moving outside of the city after that, but wanted to spend at least one year living in a fun, busy area.

I have only been here for three weeks and have only gotten one paycheck, but I can already feel the difference. With my first paycheck I paid my rent, all of my credit card payments, all of the bills I could, fulfilled all of my monetary obligations (wedding present for a friend, etc) and still have had enough money to enjoy myself and live comfortably. All this, PLUS I get paid again in a week! The weight that gets lifted off of your shoulders when you go from a job that pays you monthly to bi-monthly is huge. It's so much easier to budget and plan spending for two week periods than for a full month and it isn't even close.

My plan is to pay a little bit towards my credit cards each paycheck, so twice a month rather than each month, until they’re all paid off within a few years or so, then close the small ones (I have four that each have a limit of $300) and only keep the high limit ones with good rewards and lower interest rates (I have a $4,500 limit card and two $1,000 limit cards).

I'm also trying to be more frugal. While I want some new furniture (my new apartment is much bigger than my last one), to change my oil and tires on my car, some new suits/dress clothes for work, I haven't purchased any of this when in the past I would have in a heartbeat. I should also note that my brother is getting married in the Spring and I'll need to spend a bit for his bachelor party, so I'm trying to save for that as well.

Sidenote: I'm also trying to add a few hundred per month into my savings, which I'm not sure makes sense given my debt situation - would it be better to worry about savings after I've paid off my debt? Would it be better to just pay bigger monthly payments on my credit cards instead of putting money in savings?

I know I’m early in the process, but I’m so excited. With the cross-country move and huge change in practically every aspect of my life, I feel like I have to make a real difference and get my financial situation on track. It's like a new start and I can't afford - literally and figuratively - to get it wrong.

Anyways, I just wanted to share this with y’all! I’m super excited.

Any advice, thoughts, questions or concerns are absolutely welcome. Again, I know I’m early in the process and have a lot of work to do, but I feel like I’m finally on the right track to get out of debt.

Thanks in advance for reading and commenting!",finance
personalfinance,"Financial Check-Up: Sharing my process, looking for a little validation, and asking a few questions.","I’ve been planning this post for a while. There is a lot I want to include, but I’m going to do my best to make it succinct and structured.

**Where I started:**   
Three years ago, I had little to no savings, no budget, and lacked any sort of structure. I paid my bills and loans more or less on the basis of “Oh shit this is late, I’d better pay it soon” and didn’t have any kind of big-picture awareness of my financial situation. Something motivated me to start paying more attention to my finances, and so I started by checking my credit score: 523. That hurt. I looked into it, and there was a $140 dentistry debt that was 4 years past due. I paid that immediately, and then within a few weeks, my score jumped up about 40 points. That was a good start.    

My next step was to create a structure that I could follow to track all my student loan payments, since that’s where a lot of my money goes. I made a spreadsheet that listed the loan, the minimum payment, and the day of the month that it was due. That way I could pay them in order (Before this, sometimes I would arbitrarily pay a loan due at the end of the month and then have no money for the one that was due the next week). This was the beginning of my financial reawakening.    

Gradually, I added to the spreadsheet other expenses that were routine and predictable. Internet payment, utilities, etc. Then I added amounts and dates for things that auto-pay (like Netflix and Spotify) so I could plan and account for those too. Then later I added columns that represented months, so that I could check off payments as I made them, go down the list over the course of the month, and then move to the next month.

By this point, I was now making all my student loan payments on time, and my credit score was slowly going up. It was tremendously satisfying and motivating.    

Next I filled out a new direct deposit form at work and diverted 10% of my pay to my neglected savings account.    

Time went on.

**Where I am now:**    
Since then, I’ve gotten a better job, and my spreadsheet has grown to include: an ambitious-but-attainable budget, a comprehensive breakdown of where all of my money is going, and a spending tracker that lets me categorize all my expenditures and compare that expenditure to previous months. It’s tailored for my needs, and I’m quite proud of it. Here is a link to some Imgur screenshots, with some descriptions in the album: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/x1GZNAJ)

I’m saving $500 a month automatically, in addition to my modest 401k and HSA contributions. I’m doing my best to follow the wiki’s prime directive.    

The figures in the linked spreadsheet are factual. As you can see, I don’t really have much of a cushion. Literally 99% of my income is accounted for. Granted a fair amount of it is discretionary spending, but I’ve hit a ceiling and can’t really grow from here. I’m trying to continually optimize to give myself some wiggle room. You can see on the graph on the cover page where I decided to cut costs as much as possible (with the exception of Shopping, where I bought a new bike for exercise and transportation). I cut $600 of discretionary spending from August to September.    

I check my credit score every week on CreditKarma, and my scores per CK are now 687 and 659. Not great, but getting better. My shoddy payment history is the only thing holding me down. All my accounts are in good standing, I have no derogatory remarks, &lt;15% credit utilization, and a good long age of credit history. I just have to wait for the late payments to come off over time. 

**Looking forward:** .   
I’m not due for a raise until next year, so I have to work with the income that I have until then. I’m considering additional part-time work for beer money and breathing room.    

My girlfriend and I are moving in together around January, at which point a lot of my expenses (like rent) will be cut by roughly half. I’m looking forward to re-optimizing my life when that point comes. She has said she’s going to supplement my loan payments a bit when we live together too, so that’s just lovely.

I really, really want to refinance my student loans. I’d be happy if my monthly payment came down a bit, but I really want a lower interest rate, and only one monthly payment. I think my score needs to be higher before I have a reasonable shot of that happening.

I’m going to scale up my 401k contribution as my income and budget allows, and I’m going to keep throwing a bit of money into my HSA every paycheck. I’m still new at my company, and won’t be eligible for an employer match until next year (which is why that area is grayed out on the spreadsheet).
	 
**Questions:**

* What is my best strategy for student loan refinancing and consolidation? I’ve perused the [Student loan hero](https://studentloanhero.com/5-banks-to-refinance-your-student-loans-0113) breakdown, but what should my credit look like before I attempt an application? Who have you had good experiences with?

* My girlfriend and I want to open a shared credit card for shared expenses once we are living together. She has wonderful credit, and good financial habits. What would you look for in a shared credit card?

* Do you see any opportunities for me to cut costs? I meal prep my breakfasts and lunches for work, shop responsibly when I can, etc.

* Are there any other ways I can bring my credit score up? I sent each of my lenders a request for a goodwill credit adjustment, but one said they couldn’t do it and the other two never replied. So womp womp. Is there anything else I can try? As stated above, my payment history is the only negative contributing factor to my score.

There’s lots of information here. I’m happy to answer questions about my spreadsheet, my history, my goals, etc.

personalfinance,Fresh out of College and Dealing with Analysis Paralysis - Looking for Some Advice on My Financial Plans,"Hello everyone! I've been lurking this sub for a while, and am finally posting. I've had to pave my own way through life, so everything I know about money and personal finance has been self taught. I would REALLY appreciate some guidance/advice on my short/medium term plans. Right now i'm suffering from analysis paralysis, so I hope that engaging in this discussion can help me break out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conundrum:**

* Need a new used car. I've had my current shit pile for 6 years. Its almost 20 years old, is rusty, bad struts, AC went out, sketchy to drive. I no longer feel confident in the integrity of the car in the event of an accident.
* I also have some student loan debt.
*  I'm too financially conservative and was never taught anything other than to utilize a savings account. I am Smarter than that so I have been researching personal finance, which is how I found this sub!

**My situation:**

24 years old. Just finished graduate school and got hired on at the tech company I was interning for. 

* **Salary:** $45k/yr
* **Savings:** $24,000
* **Credit score:** \~740 (Not very diverse. All from wisely using credit cards)
* **Retirement:** 15% Roth contribution 5% employer match
* **Location:** city with low cost of living
* **Debt:** $9,000 in student loan debt (worked my ass off to pay most of my tuition out of pocket)
* **Expenses:** $750/mo including rent, utilities, groceries, bills, etc... Student loan payments will start to kick in soon, so this number will go up.
* **Need/Want:**  New (used) car. Budgeting for around $10,000 -$14,000 to have somewhat modern amenities and safety equipment. I know cars well and would be buying a car that has already seen the bulk of its depreciation hit.
* **Frugal-ness:** Paying $10 for a pack of socks nearly kills me. 

**I'm debating if I should:**

* A. Pay off my student loan debt in whole and take out a loan on a car with a $3,000-$4,000 down payment. Invest the rest of my savings minus emergency funds. Aggressively pay the car loan and likely pay it off in a little over a year.
* B. Pay for a car in cash and continue to pay down the student loans. Invest the rest of my savings minus emergency funds.
* C. Pay off the loans and pay cash for a car. Invest nothing now because I would only have enough left over for an emergency fund.

**Financial plans:**

* Interested in wisely investing some of my money in the stock market 
* In the very near future I would like to purchase a duplex or a tri-plex. By having a roommate and having a tenant(s) would cover the mortgage and capex allowing me to save more for future saving and investing. I know a lot of people in this industry and I could see myself turning this into a business depending on how I like it. I've done a lot of research, so i'm not blind as to what I could be getting myself into.

**Additional Questions:**

* I haven't shopped around for auto loan rates yet, so I don't know what kind of interest rate I could get. I am wondering what kind of hit to my credit score I could expect to see with an auto loan inquiry?
* Would the diversification of my credit via auto loan be worth paying the interest on the loan for a year (before paying it off)?
* When it comes to a mortgage, would my DTI ratio look better with student loans, or an auto loan?
* Seeing as how I might be taking out an auto loan and/or a mortgage within the next year, would now be a bad time to apply for another credit card? I would like to up my overall credit limit, but now might not be the best time.

I'm pretty harsh on myself and feel like I am falling behind where I should be financially. As you can probably tell from this post, my mind is pretty scrambled. I've had to figure all of this out on my own and it hasn't been easy. Lately I have been in a rut and haven't been making any moves because I am trying to plan everything out too perfectly.

Even if nobody replies, I think that just writing this out has helped. However, I cannot express my gratitude enough if there happens to be somebody that can chime in and give some advice!

personalfinance,Taxable accounts vs IRA/401k,"I'm just curious what the real difference is between taxable accounts and non-taxable accounts. 

Let me make sure I understand this correctly:

So if I sign up for a roth 401k, money will be taken out of my paycheck and put into the 401k account through my company and I won't pay taxes on that (federal, state tax... etc), but if I sign up for a traditional 401k it will be taken out of my paycheck and I will pay taxes on this based off of what tax bracket I'm in.

I'm also confused if I sign up for an IRA, I will be taking money that's in my bank account (already taxed through my employer) and then based on if it's a roth IRA of tradition I'll be taxed based off of what tax bracket I'm in when I put the money in/take it out.

BlockChain,The beginning of the IUNO project,"## THE PROBLEM

For centuries banks have exercised a stranglehold on the underprivileged and created a system of suppression and exploitation. In order to be able to participate in the banking system people were forced to hand over their assets to a group of irresponsible gamblers at best or white collar criminals at worst. Banks designed a system to punish people who own less and subsidize people who own more. The less money you have, the higher the costs to access banking services – from interest rates to account fees. If you are wealthy, most fees are waived and interest rates are low. This dichotomy keeps the underprivileged trapped in a vicious cycle out of which there is no escape.

personalfinance,Is it worth it to refinance my car?,"I purchased my car two years ago while I was still rebuilding my credit. I understand the recommendation against buying a new car but, with the amount of driving I do for work and the difference in income from my previous job it was the best option available to me. I owe about $18,000 on the car right now with a 6.125% interest rate and 50 months remaining and my payments are $414 per month. With my current credit score (~680) and history I can probably refinance at 3.5%-4% interest, which will be $413-$417 for 48 months. I generally pay an extra $36-$86 per month on my car loan.

I'm still rebuilding my credit but have no plans to make any large purchases in the near future, but I know that refinancing will impact my credit somewhat by reducing my average credit age as well as any impact from the inquiry. Does it seem worthwhile for me to refinance? It looks like it would save me the last two car payments (48 months vs 50 months at $414 or 44 vs 46 if I continue to pay $450).",finance
personalfinance,"College tuition and going to court to appeal to be ""financial independent"" for financial aid?","Hi,

So I got a little situation, my college institution refused to give me the full award amount on my current semester because I reported that my parents made a lot more in 2016 than the year before (I was fully covered tuition wise last year for both semesters), so I ended up having to pay half of the tuition for my current semester. Now that the next semester is almost here and fafsa is open for re-processing again, they asked for my parents' income in 2017, which, they made EVEN more money (85k before tax), after I submitted it 2 days ago and received an email today saying it was processed succesfully, I no longer see the line where it says I am eligible for a federal grant of xxxx, only that I can use Direct Stafford Loan, I'm assuming I'm screwed and will have to pay everything out of my pocket.

&amp;#x200B;

My situation is that my parents literally do not help me pay for my college nor any expenses, I'm paying for my own car, my own car insurance(that is in my name, I'm 19y.o so it's expensive), and my college tuition, I'm currently working 25-30hours a week while going to college full time, 5-6 days a week, and I currently have no medical/health insurance. After I submit my parents' transferred IRS to fafsa, the EFC(Estimated Family Contribution to my college) is around $10,000. I'm currently on my 2nd year, and have at least 5 semesters to go (2 more years), I am already studying in a community college, but I will be transferring to a 4yr university after the next semester here to do my last 2 years for a Bachelor and the tuition cost is going to be even more expensive. My family situation is a bit complicated, my step-dad is an odd man and I've only lived with him for a little over a year but we never talk, he makes a bit more than my mom, my family has 3 kids, me, and 2 other siblings in middle school, they just recently bought a house, and my step-dad has horrible credit score and owe a considerable amount of money on a Honda Civic still (he bought it brand new years ago is what my mom told me), so it's safe to say that he helping me is out of the picture, meanwhile my mom says she barely have any money left after bills and expenses. And my mom and my step dad's situation is quite unstable and they might have a fall-out anytime.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend suggested that I go to court and ask/appeal to be claimed as financial independent so I can file that on my fafsa and gets the grant, but I haven't been able to done so, as just my luck, my car was stolen 4 weeks ago at my own college at exactly noon (that literally has cameras everywhere, the camera quality is just bad and it could not catch the face of the thef, and the furthest they were able to trace it was to main street), and haven't been recovered, so I haven't been able to go to court to do this, only time when I can have a car to use is weekends when my parents don't work, but courts are closed weekends, I've been Uber-ing myself to work and school (insurance told me I must wait 30 days since the date of thef to allow for possible recovery, only then will they negotiate a payout). I read online that you have to meet certain requirements before you are eligible to be deemed financially independent, and I don't meet any of those, yet my friend suggested that I do anyway as he did his and was able to received it, anyone has any experience in this? Should I just go to the financial aid office of the school and talk to them instead? I was planning to quit school for a year after this next semester and work full time for that duration so I have enough money to pay for my last 2 years but I was expecting at least the same amount of financial aid that I received for this semester so I can at least grind it out but looks like I'll be getting $0 for fin. aid whatsoever.",finance

investing,Question about bond ETF’s as interest rates rise,"I understand that as interest rates increase the value of already issued bonds decreases because a $100 bond issued at 3% is worth more than a $100 bond issued at 2.5% and no one will buy the latter when they can get the former.

My previous company was small so I'm unaware but I think 16 days is a lot or at least more than average. How do I go about negotiating benefits or should I just negotiate the base salary?

personalfinance,Will making payment on defaulted student loan improve my credit score?,"My student loan went into default a while ago and I just spoke with the collections agency to setup a monthly payment. The agent offered me a settlement and I said no. I asked if paying on time monthly will improve my credit (which is being hurt by 12 months of missed payments) and was told no, my credit wont improve until I pay the entire balance. 

I agreed to a monthly payment and i wanted to ask if there was any reason to believe the agent that making the monthly payment wont improve my credit. After some time, it would just look like a normal loan and the missed payments would be removed from my credit report over time right? 

I tried to clarify with him, but he was being confusing and I think he was just trying to get me to agree to the settlement amount. 

Its a perkins fed loan and in collections. Thanks for any advice.",finance

personalfinance,Should I buy a Tesla Model 3 for $57k when I only make $65k a year?,"Stats - 27, make 65k a year, with reasonable expectation it will be 70k next year, 75k the following year, and 95k the year after that.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no debts, own a $300k home free and clear, and drive a $5k Honda that I own as well. I have \~$200k in savings (401k, investments, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I net $3500 a month after 401k matching of 6%. My budget is as follows:  
\- $300 a month for my property taxes and home owner's insurance (paid annually)  
\- $400 a month for utilities  
\- $1k Living expenses (food, spending money, household goods, etc)  
\- $350 car costs (fuel, insurance, maintenance fund)  
\- $650 for eventual travel expenses (based on historical cost of my recurring annual trips/vacations)  
\- $300 for a house maintenance fund  
\- $500 a month into savings

&amp;#x200B;

The car is expensive. No question about it. It would be $50k after a $7.5k federal credit (which I have the tax liability to benefit from). The credit expires at 12/31/2018, which is why I'm kind of in a hurry to make this decision.  


I would put $17,500 down and have a $630 a month car payment for 72 months. I would save on fuel and maintenance costs, but pay more in insurance. The end result would be my car costs budget would go from $350 to $800, a $450 increase. The increase would come from lowering savings to $200 a month, and lowering living expenses to $850 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

Is that stupid of me? I know, I know, I should be saving more money, but I think I'm fine financially (I got lucky). This is a bad ass car that I would love to own and I would pretty much drive it into the ground (which it sounds like is a long time given the track record of Teslas).",finance
oil,How Petrobras Built the Worlds Most Expensive Bribe Refinery,"Brazilian politics over the last few years have been a roller coaster ride. Former president Dilma Roesseuff was impeached from office, once beloved president Lula is imprisoned for illegally accepting an apartment from a powerful construction company, and the current Brazilian president the least popular president in the Americas. Operation Car Wash, a major anti-corruption probe has implicated 28 powerful corporations, and almost all of the nations political class.  Ordinary Brazilians are fed up with the corruption of their elites, and the upcoming elections in October of 2018, are expected to be the most volatile in modern Brazilian history. Today's podcast episode is about the scandal at the heart of the crisis, the massive corruption scandal at Brazil's state owned oil giant, Petrobras. The podcast will cover the history of Petrobras, the broader political system in which it functions and the incentives it creates for corruption, and the scandal that destroyed Petrobras's reputation.

Petrobras, at first glance, is the last state owned company one would expect in the middle of a corruption scandal. It has a long standing reputation for honesty and good governance. Brazilian politicians, both civilian and military, have allowed it to hire the best and brightest engineers without political interference. It has long been a trail blazer in deep see oil drilling, winning awards for its innovative approach for squeezing oil out of Brazil's challenging geology. It, despite the current scandal, has the lowest costs for recovering pre-salt oil in the world, with costs of extraction only at $8 per barrel. Moreover, the Brazilian government partially privatized Petrobras  and opened up Brazilian oil fields to international competition in the 1990s, reducing the scope for politicization of decision making, and forcing Petrobras to invest into maintaining global competitiveness. By 2009, Petrobras was the 25th largest corporation in the world, with a market capitalization of $110 billion, and annual sales of $90 billion.

However, Petrobras could not permanently escape to institutional weaknesses of Brazil's political system. The root of this problem lies in Brazil's political system, especially its electoral system. The 2014 Brazilian election cost somewhere between $ 2 billion and $ 4 billion USD. On a per capita basis, Brazilian elections cost almost as much as American elections, despite the fact the Brazilian economy is much smaller than that of America. Corporations the rely heavily upon government largess, especially Brazilian construction giants that rely upon massive public works projects, that donate most heavily to politicians. Brazilian politicians often represent their donors more than they do the voters who voted them into office. Once in office, politicians show little loyalty to party or ideology. Instead, they are most interested in reelection, pork-barrel politics, and scratching the backs of the corporations that financed their election campaigns. Unsurprisingly, Brazilian politicians find it easier to simply bribe politicians to vote the right way. In 2005, Brazil was rocked by a scandal when it was discovered the workers party paid $12,000 a month to opposition politicians to vote the right way. As Petrobras grew in scale and power, it became harder and harder for it to avoid this corrupt political system.

The major discoveries of oil in the late 2000s changed Petrobras's relationship to the rest of the Brazilian state. The government desired Petrobras to build oil refineries in the poorer regions of the country, ships built using unionized labor, and local content requirements to bring high technology manufacturing to Brazil. In order to accomplish these goals, the government appointed technocrats beholden PT, who didn't necessarily think of the profits of Petrobras first in its decision making. However, these politicized technocrats were quickly enmeshed into the political system. The basics of the Petrobras scandal was quite simple. The major Brazilian construction companies organized themselves into a cartel to bid for contracts. The companies would receive inflated contracts, and would in return donate 3% of the value of these contracts to politicians. About 2% would got the PT, with the rest shared between other parties, money launderers and the technocrats. The total costs of the Petrobras proved to be massive. Petrobras lost fife sixths of its market capitalization since 2008. Petrobras lost $1.8 billion in bribes, and fined $2.1 billion by the FCC for misleading investors. The Abreu e Lima refinery, supposed to be the largest refinery in Brazil, saw costs quadruple due to corruption and mismanagement. The massive scandal at Petrobras turned what should have been a golden opportunity to modernize the country into a fiasco.

personalfinance,Is it possible to lower ACA MAGI when only income is Social Security?,"Hey /r/personalfinance I'm looking for some advice for my mother. She just turned 63 and her only income is Social Security (survivors) where she collects $1,404 a month. She has a myriad of health issues and has been getting her health insurance for the past few years from the state (Healthy Michigan Plan). Well this year her Social Security was raised by a few dollars per month which resulted in her ""making too much"" by a whopping $95 over 138% of the federal poverty level (single adult) so the state is dropping her health insurance coverage. This will mean she will need to buy a plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace and even though she qualifies for Silver with the maximum cost savings she will still end up paying thousands per year for making only $95 over the limit.

My question is (after doing lots of research): Since the state determines her income based on the ACA MAGI rules, is it possible to lower her MAGI for next year when her only income is untaxed social security? (I know if she made income she could contribute to an IRA but she doesn't). I want to try to put her back under the income threshold to qualify again for state health insurance. We would only need to do this once or twice since she will be turning 65 and joining Medicare in two years. Thanks for any advice you can offer in advance.",finance
personalfinance,140k student loans,"So basically I have 140k in student loans. 110k in private and 30k in federal. My big mistake my freshman year was taking out a 45k Loan with an 11 percent interest rate. I since had to take out 2 more private loans at a 9 percent interest rate to total it out to where I am now. 

I recently refinanced and consolidated my loans to 5.5 percent and pay 1100 a month for the next 15 years. 

I have just gotten a good job starting at 4400 a month and will go up in 6 months. I’m lucky enough to live at home so I don’t have any bills to pay besides my car payment and my student loan payment. 

My question is. What would be the best way to pay my loans? Since I live at home I could pay a little more then double the payment for the next few years until I move out. Or I could stay in my auto payment of 1100 a month and really save the rest for emergencies, a house, etc. I’m not sure really sure which is the best long term plan. 

Edit 1. Would refinancing again be an option? I refinanced when I didn’t have the best paying job so my interest rate is still kind of high. I make a lot better money now but I first refinanced less then a year ago. My credit score is also 760.",finance
personalfinance,Credit card is offering to deposit my available credit for a 1% fee and 0% interest rate until January 2020. Is there something useful I can do with this?,"Today I got an email from Barclays with a promotional offer to transfer my available credit on my Uber Visa card to a checking account for a balance transfer fee of 1% and a 0% interest rate until January 2020. My available credit is $12,000, and I plan on continuing to use the card so I wouldn't want to transfer more than $11,000.

The fine print is pretty simple, it doesn't look like they will back-charge the interest if I do not pay off the balance by the end of the offer period (which I've heard can often be the case with promotional interest rates), but I don't plan for that to be a problem anyway. I do not plan on purchasing a car or taking out any other loans or opening new credit cards throughout the year, so the available balance hit to my credit score won't matter. 

I am doing just fine, my only debt is a mortgage, so I can't pay off anything with this offer. My bank account has a 1.85% APY right now, but I don't know if the hassle is worth $93.50 (.85% * 11000). I could just dump the balance straight into my brokerage account (60/40 VTI/VXUS), and pay it back throughout the year. This would make sense from a lump sum vs cost averaging perspective, but it is a little risky, as there is an opportunity cost if the market drops and I'm stuck paying back the balance instead of investing with every paycheck like I normally do.

I dunno, what do you guys think? 

**fine print:**

&gt; ^1 Eligibility for an ACH is dependent on receiving a Promotional Offer, account in good standing, and other risk criteria. Only 1 ACH per month allowed.  

&gt;Please consider your available credit and the transaction fee when determining the balance transfer amount. 

&gt;*Disclosure information for balance transfers made under this offer: 

&gt;**Promotional APR for Balance Transfers under this offer:** Promotion APR of 0% through the last day of your statement that closes on or after January 1, 2020. 

&gt;After the promotional period ends, the APR for these transferred balances will be the standard APR, which is currently 16.74%. This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate. The standard APR for balance transfers noted above is current as of September 26, 2018. 

&gt;**Post by Date:** Your balance transfer must post to your account by December 3, 2018 for this promotional APR offer to apply. If the balance transfer posts to your account after that date, you will not receive the promotional APR. Instead, the standard APR for balance transfers will apply. 

&gt;**Balance Transfer Fee:** Either $5 or 1% of the amount of each transaction, whichever is greater, for transactions that post to your account by December 3, 2018. 

&gt;If the balance transfer posts to your account after December 3, 2018, the Balance Transfer Fee will either be $10 or 3%. 

&gt;**Paying Interest:** We charge interest on purchases, balance transfers and cash advances beginning on the transaction date. You can avoid paying interest on purchases if you pay your entire balance (which includes all purchases, cash advances, and new and existing balance transfers) by the payment due date each and every month. This offer includes a reduced APR on balance transfers during the promotional period. You can avoid interest on purchases without paying your entire balance. Instead, you can pay, by the payment due date, your entire balance minus this reduced APR balance transfer balance. To avoid a late fee, you should pay at least the minimum payment due on your account each month.",finance

investing,WTF Bonds?!?,"Reddit! Help an investing idiot make sense of bombs, I've been trying on my own for months. Basically, I can't wrap my noggin around the whole world is interest thing.... Obviously a hot topic right now. 

Basically, what I THINK happens is the yield goes up, which means those bonds will pay the bearer more. However, for some reason (I'd be interested in hearing why)  the fed can't actually let bonds be too good of an investment, so when the bond yield goes up, they attempt to balance that out by raising the interest rates, which makes it 'more expensive to borrow' whatever that means.....

 Like, if the yield is going up, isn't it already 'more expensive to borrow'? Since when I buy a bond they're borrowing my money, and when the yield goes in they pay more and I make more, right?

So is it the interest rate increasing that effects this, or not? 

Also, is this good or bad for bonds? I know that's stupid, but seriously, if the yield goes up my bonds should pay me more, but then if the fed raises the interest in response, THAT makes the bonds worth less? But if one is done in response to the other, why wouldn't they just balance, and it would be a net nothing? 

Is what's happening right now good for bond buyers or bad?",finance

financialindependence,"Anxious, about to pull trigger and leave job...","Hi Everyone, 

First a huge thanks to this community for all of your support and advice.  Even knowing the math and having read voraciously, you sometimes just psychologically need other humans to confirm they get the same answer as you.  This community has done that for me time and time again.  On to the reason for my post:

In January of this year, I posted about leaving my job in 2019 to pursue/finalize my Phd.  I have a fellowship that means I'll have free coursework, and earn a very small stipend that essentially covers a few lunches out a month and some walking around money.  This is my version of CoastFIRE for now, though I'd like to go back to work in 2-3 years.  That said, I've emotionally prepared myself to accept that getting back to work at the same pay level may be difficult due to job market, etc.

My husband is employed, and plans to keep his gig.  We can live off of his single salary while he continues to put the federal max away into his 401k each year.  We have healthcare through his employer.  He plans to work another ten years.  

Here are some assorted facts and numbers, and we live in a high cost of living area (to put the numbers in perspective):

1) We want our 4% WDR to give us 160k per year to live comfortably in this same high cost of living area, after tax.  This gives us out-of-pocket health care premiums until we qualify Medicare, and it also means we spend more in retirement than we do today.
2) We currently spend about 80k per year after tax.
3) We have saved (total as of today, together) 2.35Million in various accounts.  
4) For simplicity, let's say 65% is in nontaxable accounts.
5) As of January 2019, we will continue to save 25k per year on his one salary.
6) Note: If I keep working, we can save 60k per year.
7) Our FIRE number is 4M (to get 160k at 4% WDR)
8) We are choosing to not factor in SS and a small pension I have coming to me (emphasis on small)

My questions are these:
1) With the above info, do you agree 4M is our fire number?
2) By my calculation, I understand we will get to 4M in 9 or 10 years even if I Coast Fire in January - assuming no major issues/interruptions.  Do you agree? 
3) Am I silly to CoastFire/BaristaFire now given the expectation of a recession?  

Notwithstanding all of the above, I just have so much anxiety about walking away now but I really need to do this.  I am afraid I am suffering from ""one more year"" syndrome.  I really am miserable in my current situation and something has to change, so I'm 90% sure that I'm walking come January.  I think I'd like another gig later, but worried that I'll never get one.  I know this is all silly, but....

Thanks in advance!",finance

Bitcoin,"Fidelity CEO’s Comments Regarding Bitcoin. From Barron’s Newspaper, October 6 2018","“Fidelity spends $2.5 billion a year on technology, with a workforce of “10,000 technologists around the globe.” The results aren’t apparent in whiz-bang features like virtual-reality tools or computer-generated financial advisors—yet. But it drives down operating costs and pays off in the background. Many registered investment advisors choose to custody assets with Fidelity because its platform works so well, says Lowell. Fidelity isn’t a tech disrupter, he adds, but “among the major financial houses, it’s one of the most tech-oriented and progressive.”

Fidelity develops much of its own financial tools, apps, and trading technology in its incubator, Fidelity Labs. On a recent visit to the Labs, the firm showed off augmented-reality goggles that it’s developing for 3-D charting. A team was working on a Bitcoin service (tightly under wraps) that Johnson says she “hopes to have commercially available by the end of the year.”

If Fidelity does launch a digital-coin exchange, it would, as is often the case, not be the first. In February, Robinhood started offering commission-free trading in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, now allowed in the 17 states. An exchange called ErisX, backed by TD Ameritrade Holding (AMTD) and Virtu Financial (VIRT), recently announced plans to trade digital currencies and related derivatives. ETFs may be coming soon: The Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing whether to approve nine Bitcoin-related ETFs over the next few months.

Fidelity investors can see Coinbase balances on Fidelity.com and donate digital currency to the Fidelity Charitable Donor-Advised Fund. And the firm is experimenting internally. Some company cafeterias accept Bitcoin as payment, and a Bit &amp; Blocks club (2,600 members connected with Fidelity’s blockchain incubator) sponsors an annual Crypto-Asset Portfolio Challenge for employees (using hypothetical currencies).

One thing Fidelity learned? Hardly anyone uses Bitcoin to buy lunch because the currency could appreciate so fast that a pizza could end up costing the equivalent of $50 by the time you’ve finished eating. The firm also found out how easy it is for computerized cryptocurrency traders to beat people: Indian programmers developed trading bots for the in-house contest, prompting Fidelity to put constraints on the strategy.

Bitcoin, says Abby, is an “extracurricular activity for me.” But she’s well versed in the lingo. “You start hashing the blocks and hope to hit one first, which is when you mine your coins,” she says, describing the mining operation. Fidelity dipped into mining Bitcoin, through a small venture launched in 2015. “This was Fidelity writing a check to buy a bunch of computer equipment,” says Johnson. “We expected to lose money on it. But we were making ridiculous amounts of money at the peak.” Fidelity is exploring more “use cases” for Bitcoin, she adds, while waiting for federal regulators to issue more trading, tax, and anti-money-laundering rules.”",cryptocurrency

Thank you for any advice",finance

financialindependence,Canadian FIRE?,"Lots of really great posts here regarding 401ks and all that, but I'm wondering what's the best course of action for Canadians?

It seems that for Americans, the quickest (reasonable) route to FIRE is sinking as much as possible into a 401k. Would this mean that a similar route for a Canadian would be to sink as much as possible into an RSP? At the moment I have a TFSA, mutual funds, and an RSP. Which should get prioritized? The internet tells me maxing out the TFSA isn't necessary but all my co-workers who are FIRE-minded say to max out the TFSA first thing.

Looking to properly get started here (I'm 25). What's the best route to take?

EDIT: TD also has an ""ePremium"" savings account with an interest rate of 1.05%. Is this relevant?",finance
personalfinance,Is it possible to remove delinquent student loans from my credit report if they have been brought current?,"While in college I took out a number of student loans to pay my way. Long story short, after college I was unable to make my payments and instead of dealing with it responsibly I froze up and simply let it go delinquent. I have since consolidated my student loans the old accounts have be closed out with a $0 balance. 

My credit score did take a sizable leap after that but it is still rather low. Although they have been corrected, I still show delinquent accounts and my overall ""on-time payments"" % is rather low.

Is there anything I can do about having them removed from my credit report?  I know some institutions will do that but I also know there is no requirement for them to do so. The reporting agencies are US Dept of Education and FedLoan Servicing.",finance
personalfinance,How do I best utilize damages from a law suit?,"Long story short, I was awarded $180k (had to sign a NDA so I can't get specific). My financial house is pretty squared away, the only debt my wife and I have is our house. We owe about $85k on it but our interest rate is pretty low (3.25% fixed for 30yrs). Vehicles are paid for and are in good working order. House is in good shape (new furnace, roof, insulation etc.). Investment account for our kids college fund is on track. My wife and I both have a good chunk set aside in our retirement funds. We also have just over a years combined salary in savings.

What's the best way to make this money work for our family? An annuity, CD's? Not sure what to do other than putting it into a saving account and let it sit. There's got to be a smarter way of handling it. 

Thought I would give this a shot before I made an appointment with my accountant/financial planner.

Any advice is appreciated!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Is the beginning of the Stock Market CRASH?,"The Dow Jones went down 200 points in day, people are starting to panic, interest rates are at an all time high, trade war with China still on going, dollar value at risk of falling...

All make for a perfect storm for the next recession, there’s one every 10 years, last one was in 2008, I was expecting it too start in 2019 but by the looks of it’s starting now, Q4 2018.

What does this have to do with crypto you ask, I think once the next recession hits the crypto market cap will hit an all time high, talking trillions. Because everyone will put their money on digital currency like bitcoin as a store of value or because of the technology behind it like ethereum or EOS.

personalfinance,"Is it better to make a large payment to principle of auto loan, or make a year of advance payments and a smaller payment to principle.","I recently settled for a car accident from a couple of years ago. Due to the accident, I had to get a new car. Right now, I have $10,000 left on the principle, a 4.9% interest rate, and make a $250 payment each month.

I paid off a relatively small credit card balance because it had the highest interest rate, and also paid off a medical bill just to get that over with. This leaves me with approximately $5,000 to apply towards my car.

I am working part-time this year until I finish my Masters Degree in May. I can afford my car payment but it is a big chunk of my monthly expenses. Because of this, I wonder if it is best to make a year of car payments up front ($3,000) so that I don't have to worry about that until I go back to work full-time and then put $2,000 on the principle. This is opposed to putting the full $5,000 on the principle but I assume I would have to continue to pay my $250 car payment each month.

I have never had such a large amount of money to work with, so want to make sure I use it wisely. Any advice appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,"Buying a Condo - Dealing with Student Loans - Have extra cash, where should I put it?","Hi PF,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the process of purchasing a condo with my wife (she has no debt) in NYC (Manhattan), and working to get my finances in order. Additionally, I have some significant student loans I'm dealing with. I will have about 30-40k available after closing (while still maintaining 6mo of mortgage / tax / HOA payments), that I'm looking to use to pay down some debt. I'd love to reduce my monthly payments, as well as reduce the overall interest paid (though a focus more on reducing my payments). I also want to do it in whichever way is most tax advantageous. We plan to stay in the condo at least 7 years, more likely 10-15 years, but of course this is all conjecture.

&amp;#x200B;

Mortgage - 764k @ 4.25% (1 point would bring the rate down to 4.00% at a cost of $7,640) - $3,758/mo

Student Loan 1 - 35k @ 4.375% (federal loan) - $414/mo

Student Loan 2 - 88k @ 5.05% (SoFi, variable rate) - \~$830/mo, but keeps increasing due to variable rate

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeing several options here, or some combination of options:

1. Reduce the mortgage by $14k so that the size of the loan is at the mortgage interest deduction max
2. Pay a point towards the mortgage which reduces the monthly payment by $110, and is tax deductible
3. Pay off all of Student Loan 1 (would be nice to clear something out completely)
4. Pay of part of Student Loan 2, then refinance
5. Hold on to the money as an additional fall back just in case and invest it

Options 1 + 2 are great since they both have advantageous tax consequences, though neither of those consequences are huge. Option 3 is great because it wipes $414/mo off of my monthly debts, and it would be really nice to clear something out entirely. Option 4 is great because it's the highest interest rate. I will likely refinance that loan regardless, once I close on the Condo.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be great. Thank you!

personalfinance,Seeking advice on high interest auto loan,"I have a loan on my car with an interest rate of 16.49%. It's an insane rate that I never should have agreed to. However, at the time i had the money and needed the car. Without previous credit history or a co-sign I accepted the loan. The loan now costs ($3,232.35) more than the car is worth according to KBB ($3,100). I've looked into refinancing and have yet to find a lender willing to pick up the loan as the amount remaining is &gt;$5k  and the mileage is over 100k. So, am i screwed? Am I just going to have to continue with this loan until its paid off? Should I make larger payments to balance out the cost of the loan and then sell? Thank you for reading. Any advice is appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Review My Beginner's Budget + Advice on Uncertain Future Goals,"**Part 1: High-Saving Budget Advice**

I'm 25yo making 110k/yr. I want to save aggressively so that I can be FI (but not necessarily RE). My current planned annual budget:

* 26.4k for rent/utilities (2.2k/mo)
* 7k for food (estimating more than 500/mo)
* 18.5k to max out 401k
* 13.75k to max out my ESPP (12.5% of salary) and sell asap for instant 15% profit (minus tax)
* 1.45k to max out HSA (company provides 2k, so I only have 3.45k max limit - 2k match = 1.45k to contribute?)
* 5.5k in Roth IRA
* 33k for all taxes/SS/etc with 401k deduction (estimating using online tool but not sure exactly how to calculate all this)

Note: don’t have need for a car currently.

Left over: 4.4k + ESPP return from previous year so ~20k/yr of fun/travel/“idk what to do with” money. I currently have 30k in a savings account as an emergency fund.

Does this seem like a reasonable high-level plan for someone who wants to save well? Obviously I’ll need to adjust as I go through expenses since I’m currently only estimating.

**Part 2: Unknown Long Term Goals**

My biggest issue is that I don’t know what my future goals are. Will I have a partner one day? Will I own a home one day (definitely not in California…)? With all these unknowns, I’m not sure if dumping everything into retirement accounts is a good idea, although I still like the idea of being FI. 

f I ever wanted to buy a home, I’d have to save enough cash for a downpayment, but don’t know if/when/where that’ll happen. Simply saving a bunch of money each each in a at-best 2% interest rate savings account seems like a waste if I decide to rent for a long time and could’ve had the money invested.

Would appreciate some advice on how to deal with this uncertainty.",finance

gaming,Best place to farm for souls in Dark Souls Remastered,"Finally playing through this game! It's been a great summer for gaming, even if I had to get cancer (finished three months of chemo and I'm told I'm cancer-free, knock on wood, all things considered). I've played through Fallout 4, Uncharted 4, Call of Duty: Infinite War, and even finished the main storyline in The Witcher 3 for the first times, and now I'm giving Dark Souls my all! I played on PS3 for a handful of hours years ago, remember ringing the first bell, but kind of gave up out of frustration. Now, I'm playing through again on PS4 with the remastered version, and it's been great. Just this morning, I rang the second bell and opened up Sen's Fortress (stepped close enough to lure out and kill two lizard guys inside but haven't gone any further).    

&amp;#x200B;

So, I guess what I'm asking is if there's somewhere best to farm for souls. It got a little frustrating venturing around Blighttown then losing the 10,000 souls I'd gathered. Level upgrades cost just over 10,000 souls right now. Just found the Iaito sword, fed a bunch of things to Kingseeker Frampt and leveled it up to +6 (I think), so that's what I'm using right now. I've got Quelaag's soul. Got lucky somehow and glitched/killed the big lava squid thing below Quelaag's lair in a few hits, but those fire demon guys below kick my ass. I've explored quite a bit but haven't been the to Depths or explored much of New Londo Ruins (got to a room at the top of the steps with like 6 ghosts and they wiped me out the last time I was there, but that was a while ago and I feel a lot stronger).    

&amp;#x200B;

Roundabout way of saying I'm really enjoying the game now that I'm not dying every few minutes like I was when playing through on PS3, and I'm looking for a great place to farm souls. Thanks in advance!",technology
personalfinance,Best way to build up savings (canada),"So I have just started a new job at a concrete manufacturing plant 

After federal, provincial, cpp and Ei Deductions and the essential bills (350$ CAD a month for insurance, 250$ a month toward a debt I will have paid off by Christmas and 220 a month towards gas) I will still have over 1500$ left over each month so let's say 1350 $ since I have to live a little right?

What's the best way to start saving money and how much would you recommend putting into savings or other accounts if there are better ways of saving or making money off my money beyond interest 

I'm currently 18 and I have a car that my parents own that I am the primary driver on and I live at home and will most likely be paying that 250$ a month for that debt that will be gone by Christmas toward rent or groceries to keep my parents happy after i pay off the debt any I don't have any forseen upcoming expenses at least for a year or 2 until I go back to school

personalfinance,Consolidating student loans into lower interest rates seems to be prolonging pay off period and increasing interest paid,"My girlfriend and I are working on creating a budget and paying off student debt.  I have been using unbury.us to try and decide which pay off method would save us the most money and pay off our debt quickest. The first scenario I created has all of the loans as they currently stand, with a projected pay off date of Nov. 2023 with a total of $19,800 interest paid.  The second scenario has our loans (with the exception of 3 of my girlriend's federal loans) consolidated with anticipated interest rates and has a projected pay off date of Mar. 2024 with a total of $20,036 interest paid. 

We are both confused as to how consolidating our loans into lower interest rate loans can prolong and increase our repayment, specifically because my girlfriend would be dropping two $16,000 loans by roughly 2.5%.  We are both atrocious at math, would anybody be able to provide some insight as to why this may be?

investing,is the cheap money policy of central banks going to finally end?,"been very interested in anything related to investing, and it seems like 95% of all asset classes I have checked out, profited one way or the other, from cheap credit, be it real estate, expensive art, rare cars, even rare synsthesizers, basically everything with any hope of holding value while the base currency these goods are traded with, got swamped with cheap liquidity. so now we see global real estate markets sky high, people not able to afford housing, housing even vacant as their owners usually are big investors, then we got highly overvalued stock markets, and maybe even the cryptocurrency markets might have profited from a dollar that keeps inflating everything, right?



of course europe and other central-bank-controlled nations, have been behaving similarly lax with their fiscal policy.



**now my big question to the pros**: what kind of necessity is there, for central banks, to hike interest rates, as so many are expecting, cause I don't get it...why can't they just keep printing money? who can, and who must pop this bubble, and if so, why?

personalfinance,"Backed into a financial corner, on the verge of graduating.","I have put myself in a bind. I have struggled to pay for college for the past 7 years and have taken out loans and money anywhere that I can get it and am drowning in minimums and unable to pay for my final year of college. 

I am in my final year of a professional healthcare graduate program. I spend 40+ hours a week in rotations. I pay for college by maxing out federal student loans, help from a small scholarship, and working a part time to pay the rest. I need to pay another $2000 to the university by the end of this month or I will be unable to go to rotations for Spring 2019 (and thus be unable to graduate). I have begged the school for financial help. They told me to go apply for private loans. I do not qualify for private student loans and I do not have a cosigner. No one in life to borrow money from. Work also contributes a little bit to a retirement plan even though I am not currently contributing anything myself.

I make around $1000 a month from part time job. 

Credit Karma Score: 583
No late payments in 4 years, no collections, 4 inquiries, 2 year credit age, 121% utilization. 

Current Debts:

- Credit Card #1: $146.66 ($25 minimum, 24.65% APR) ($200 limit)

- Credit Card #2: $782.25 ($27 minumum, 24.65% APR) ($750 limit)

- Credit Card #3: $952.26 ($30 minumum, 24.65% APR) ($1000 limit)

- Credit Card #4: $2781.18 ($95.52 minimum, 28.74% APR) ($2000 limit)
- Retirement loan: $779.19, ($20.64 minimum, 4.75% APR, auto deducted from check) (from above mentioned contribution)

Not late on anything. Only paying minimums. CC4 minimum hurts. CC2 is over limit because of annual fee. CC4 is over limit because I used a 18-month-no-interest deal to replace my broken computer and didn't pay it off in time. 

Current Expenses:

- Rent ($200 for my half)

- Parking Lease for Apartment ($35)

- Cell Phone ($95)

- Gas/Electric: (Up and down, sum of both on average is $88 for my half)

- Cable/Internet: ($80 for my half)

- Groceries ($250)

- Car fuel (driving to rotations/work): $150 

Probably won't find cheaper rent. It's already below average for the area and the landlord is quick to solve problems. On a lease anyway until May. 

Cell phone is already on cheapest plan. Must have a smart phone for rotations (expected to look things up on the fly). On an installment plan, so nothing can be done here.

Gas/electric is about as cheap as can get it. Already freezing in winter and sweating in summer in my apartment. Have tried to get cable cheaper. 

Comcast refuses to budge on price. No other internet options. Have a mediocre tier plan. Just goes up in price constantly. 

Grocery budget includes everything from food to cleaning supplies, hygeine, etc. 

Public transportation isn't an option where I live. Mostly non-existant. 

Need to pay $2000 to school for rotation credits by end of October or I can't register for Spring 2019 rotations and thus can't graduate. This is the big thing I need to pay, but I can't do it without destroying my credit on everything else and falling behind. Probably don't qualify for any balance transfer cards. I have managed to borrow and borrow my way through school but I have hit the point where I have nothing left to borrow. Was also supposed to trade in an old phone to Verizon, but I ended up selling it for more than they offered me. Still need to give them $500 (sold phone for $750) to cover. Been holding the cash because I'm tempted to put it on school and deal with Verizon later. 

Current Cash: $1450

Not paying the $2000 means I have to stop attending rotations until it's paid, and then I'd have to wait for the next academic year to start over. Not allowed to just start rotations whenever I want.

65,000annually take home from work
20700 annually from renters (which will not last forever)

I've seen a few articles saying that there are ways around this and one is to prove paying back the loan would be an undue hardship. It seems like a long shot but I'm wondering if anyone out there has advice or has done this and can speak from personal experience. In a chapter 7 or chapter 13 bankruptcy. 

I know the best advice is to contact a bankruptcy lawyer but I  thought I'd send a shout out into the Reddit void for advice first. 

Context: my partner has developed/been diagnosed with bi-polar 2 since he took out his student loans (to attend law school) he can no longer work as an attorney due to his illness and any of the jobs he has had have been around $8- $15 an hour. Over the past year his diagnoses from depression to bipolar 2, and switching to a more appropriate Med plan has helped him tremendously. His loans have already accumulated almost $10,000 in interest (started at about $100.000). And even if he is able to continue working these jobs He would never be able to pay off the loan completely. His currently plan is an income based repayment where he pays  $0 every month. He may start to make nominal payments from $22-$200 a month if he can stay healthy. But he would still never pay off the total loan. It's a 20 year loan, and I am not sure if it's a federal or private loan.",finance

I'm currently on a Graduated Payment Plan (current monthly payment is $195). When I make my payment, it automatically breaks the $195 down and pays some of each loan, prioritizing the one with the highest interest followed by the others.

But I also feel like it was written from the perspective that if a person in given a credit card they will automatically spend more than they have. I have no problem believing that's true for most people but it's not true for me. I tried to explain that I would use it responsibly and how building credit was essential and they gave me the ""No one needs credit line, rich people buy their houses cash."" Well I told them they've surely didn't buy the house cash and while some rich people like Dave Ramsey buy their houses cash it's a huge waste of money for others who can just make the down payment and invest the rest. J didn't get anywhere with the conversation and eventually we all just got frustrated and my mom said something along the lines of ""Look we're just trying to help you, and if you bury yourself in credit card debt we don't have the money to bail you out"" and frankly that made me pretty livid. I have NEVER asked my parents for money. And while I understand that most kids my age you their credit cards to buy alcohol or take a spring trip to Europe I'm not them. I would just my credit card primarily for gas, books and minor wants that I would buy anyways with my debit. I know interest rates are insanely high on student cards but I will make the full payment every month. I understand that they are just trying to help me but I still think that family can have honest intentions and still be wrong. 

So instead I decided to ask a bunch of random people on the internet and see what the general consensus is :) If I hear that I'm wrong from a bunch of people on Reddit I'll be more receptive than just hearing it from my parents.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loan?,"Hello!

I am working on reducing my debt and have successfully paid off several credit card balances which drastically improved my credit score. Now that I have tackled that debt, I am working on paying off my student loans. 

I have about ~11,000 in student loan debt with a 3.86% fixed interest rate. At first, I thought I should start paying off large chunks of this debt to eliminate it as fast as possible. However, I have been reading some things in this subreddit where people have advised to invest the extra money rather than make larger payments towards their low interest student loans. 

I have calculated that I can comfortably pay off my student loans by May 2019 with the larger payments (~$500-2000 per month). The required (minimum) monthly loan payment is $135. 

Would this be the type of situation where it would be better for me to invest that money instead of paying off my loan? I still would plan on paying more than the minimum payments, somewhere between $200-400 per month, depending on the month. 
Also, if I did pay off this loan by May 2019, would that negatively affect my credit score since the account would be closed?

Taking everything into account, I have around £150 to spare per month which I could use to put towards my debt (approx 10k). The majority of these debts have probably been paid off with interest but with the extortionate interest rates the original amount owed has doubled.

So should I save to make an offer to clear the debt or should I up the monthly payment? My goal is to clear these debts as quickly as possible. If the former, what would be the recommended percentage of the outstanding debt I should offer?

I appreciate 150 isn't that much but with a pay raise due next year, I'm hoping to increase this further.

personalfinance,Am I doing this debt managment thing correctly now?,"So when I was younger (like 18 to 23) I had credit cards and made the all too common mistake of spending like crazy. Now dont get me wrong, things I bought, I used and valued but ultimately didnt HAVE to have at that very moment. Fast forward to 3 years later and I'm engaged and planning for my future and working on my career. I've become much more financially aware but credit companies dont exactly forgive your financial misdeeds of the past. So I wanted to lay out my plan here and see if I'm doing this right and if I can get some tips.

Background: My net income is around $3300/month with expenses (including food and gas) equating to about $2000. I currently have, brace yourself, about $24000 in debt between what I refinanced (for lower interest rates) and the cards I've frozen (again to avoid increasing interest). I have 3 credit cards I'm currently paying down.

 Its alot and frankly if I think about it too much it's an overwhelming number. I take comfort only from knowing others have much more than that and my career path will lead me to a six figure (at least upper 5 figure) income in the next 10 years. 
So with that other 1300 a month I've been paying minimums on 2 cards and paying the rest (about 700/month) on my highest interest card.

Some decisions I've made in regular expensis:

Currently I have a cracked screen on my phone but it's still operable (and the crack only removes like 5% of the screen space off to the side) so, as tempted as I am to fix it or upgrade, I've decided to just pay the rest of my phone off to lower my phone bill and use it as long as I can (at least another year)

My employer pays for one of my meals per day (lunch) and I've been taking advantage of that more offten now (even if the food isn't exactly gormet) 

I got a Costco membership and cleaned out the fridge and pantry and now in stead of eatting out 5 time a week or more my fiance and I cook our meals at home (I'd estimate this cuts our food cost roughly in half).

As far as entertainment I play video games and watch movies online. So we do pay for a hulu account and the game I play does cost me $15/month. The later is being reduced by a deal I got where I saved about 3 bucks a month from paying for 6 months of it in advance (it's not a huge savings but I'm saving 12 bucks on a payment if be making anyway. Its pretty much the only game I need right now so it's a cut from the $60 a month I used to spend on videogames.

I live in a city so I'm thinking of dropping the roughly $100 it would cost to fix up my bike and cut costs on gas whenever the weather and circumstances allows me to ride it.

I dont know I feel like I'm getting back on track but I wanted to post my story and maybe get some tips or hell even some reassurance that I AM on the right track. Lemme know and thanks for any constructive feedback",finance

personalfinance,Why does my $16k car cost me $26k,"I bought a used Mazda 3 last Sept. for roughly 16k (the dealer agreed to waive some documentation fees so lowered the price to $15500). I recently decided to take a look at the paperwork and realized the ""total balance I must pay"" is $26 497 !!! I have gone over all the costs in my head and have no clue if I'm being ripped off or this is normal... I'll show the breakdown below 

Cash selling price of property and related services being financed = ( $2828) + ($2108) = $22799

Unpaid balance of cash selling price and fees to be financed = $22 888

Interest charges - fixed interest rate at 4.99% for 72 months = $3608

Cost of borrowing / cost of credit = $3666

Total balance you must pay = $26 497

This is my first time buying a car from a dealer so I'm unsure if all this makes sense. 

Any help making sense of all this is appreciated !! :)",finance
investing,Am I Too Bearish?,"I am wondering if someone can lay out the bullish case and/or dispute my current and personal view of the current market conditions as I see it. Not looking to push my opinions, rather to let me know am I being too bearish.

This is the bear case as I see it.

    \- Baby boomer retirement and the resulting pension crisis and levels of debt must result in money printing. 
    
    \- Unknown effects of quantitative tightening; whereas quantitative easing resulted in the rise of asset prices, tightening might result in the opposite. Tens of billions of dollars every month destroyed by the FED.
    
    \- FED hiking risk-free rate.
    
    \- Trade tensions.
    
    \- Peak(?) economic growth.
    
    \- Ill-timed fiscal stimulus, during the late bull phase.
    
    \- Excess multi-asset valuations inflated by quantitative easing.
    
    \- Nearing the end of a 35 yr bond bull market.
    
    \- Rising populism and anti-global, nationalistic sentiment.
    
    \- Unknown effects of market weighted passive indexed funds (e.g. SPY).

Am I missing something? Are these ill-informed fears? What is the bull case?

The only bull case I can lay out is this.

    \- This might be a is a secular bull market. Historical examples of secular bull markets include 1949-1966 (17 years); 1982-2000 (18 years; disregarding the crash of 87.)
    
    \- The is a bullish consensus among 244 leading money managers, mutual fund managers, and hedge fund managers; especially on US equities.
    
    	70% favor U.S. stocks over other regions
    
    	Net overweight position in U.S. stocks is 21% and rising

personalfinance,What type of Mortgage Loan for us?,"So this is a follow up to my last post asking if we should be all set for pre-approval:

We were considering an FHA loan because we don't have much credit history. Credit Karma has my score at 685, but we don't have any credit cards because we don't like debt. Debt to income ratio is 0:4.5k a month (no debt). We have much more than the 20% for a downpayment, and now I'm researching and found out that no matter what the downpayment, we will still have to pay PMI on an FHA loan. But, the loans can be at a lower interest rate, which may balance it off anyways?

A conventional loan says it usually requires about 620, but I'm not sure how they feel about a lack of credit history even though we have no debt and plan to put at least 20% down. The FHA would probably be easier to get approved, but I'm not sure it would financially be worth it since we have the money easily for the down payment. Which type of loan sounds right for our situation?

Tldr: Not much credit history (685 score), no debt, can put at least a 20% down payment. FHA or Conventional?",finance
personalfinance,just turned 18 and still in highschool. Which one should i apply for?,So I just turned 18 not too long ago and I wanted to get a head start on my credit. I went to wells Fargo to get info about their secured credit and the banker said it would be a better decision to get a student credit since the interest rate and its minimum deposit was so high....I looked into a couple student credit cards; one from Discover and one from capital one. I was quite interested in the Discover it chrome for student card but I didn't apply because I feel its just for college students and though I would get denied since I am still in high school as a senior; I don't want to a hard inquiry on my credit report and get denied for the discover card. Im not sure if I should apply for the discover card or wait until I'm a college student...or I can apply for the capital one card but the Discover card has all the amazing benefits lol. I would appreciate any feedback on what I should do. Thanks!!,finance
personalfinance,CPA / CFP utilization question,"Hey all. Curious about the need and cost of using a CPA / CFP. I am an independent contractor of my own LLC. I was going to utilize CPA services to help me maximize deductions / taxation of my income. I was also going to utilize CFP/wealth management services. My question is what should the relative cost of this stuff be? Is it worth having a CFP who is taking 1% of managed assets and having them employed or is it worth just using them as check ins for a fee? CPA as well.
I just graduated residency and have a lot of student loans (800k total between my wife and I at different interest rates.. some high). My financial plan basically focuses around building an emergency fund followed by aggressively paying off high interest loans that are already consolidated. Besides life insurance which I will get (mostly because I am about to have a child)I'm not positive there are many other things the CFP would inform me of that would be different than my current plan. I already have myself a relative budget (relative because I dont know about baby costs) and have a plan to maximizee contributions (exactly to what the CPA can guide me to) while saving at least 20+% of income Am I thinking about this incorrectly? Would it be best to utilize services now or maybe two years from now as I start paying into my loan amount? Would It be better to have someone just give me broad scope advice then later have one on retainer?
Lost. Thanks for the help.",finance
personalfinance,"Questions about credit reports, scores, and how best to proceed with a acquiring a car","Back in 2015, I had a confluence of personal and family problems that led to an extended period out of work -- overall it was nearly 3 years, with a few months where I thought I was able to work, but quickly learned I really wasn't ready. I managed to run up about $20k in credit card debt, which I am now finally clawing my way back out of.

By paying minimums, I now find myself with about $15k in credit card debt, broken down between two accounts:

* Discover, $11k, account closed, paying as agreed for the last 24 months. Marked on my Equifax report with an activity designator of ""C"" -- collection account. No interest is being charged on this account so long as I maintain my payments.
* Capital One, $3.5k utilized of $5k credit line, with an interest rate of 21%. I am currently aggressively paying this off at about $2k a month, so it will be gone sometime in December. (Merry Xmas to me!)

My situation is such that my expenses are approaching zero -- my wonderful family have given me a place to live and car to use to get back on my feet. However, I would like to purchase a car as soon as I am able. The situation is OK for now, but it's hard on all involved.

So, my questions are:

* Does a closed account factor into my overall credit utilization? Or, perhaps put a different way, will paying off my Capital One balance make a meaningful change to my credit score (currently \~600)?
* Does it make any sense to attempt to get an auto-loan in my current situation? I expect by early spring to be able to put \~$8k down, and ideally would like to finance another $8k. I'm not looking for the car of my dreams, just a reliable car, likely a 2014 or so Accord that will last me 500k miles or more.

I guess I'm not sure what impact that closed but paying-as-agreed Discover account is having on me overall, and that's what I need to understand. It's the biggest negative on my report by far, with several months in 2016 of 180+ days delinquent. It just isn't obvious what path I should take to acquiring a car. I do feel like I can get something perfectly reliable &amp; serviceable for $8k. Perhaps the problem here is just that I want something nicer?

Any feedback is welcome; thanks for reading.",finance
personalfinance,How to settle a medical debt,"Back story: I was in college and did not have any insurance through my mom. I also had two health issues during my time in college.

I made $7.25 a hour and reffed on the weekends. I wasn’t able to pay. 

Fast forward to me getting my first real job and saving for over 3 years. I’ve also started a family. So what I did save I can’t automatically pay that off and end my safety net for us. 

So when I get my taxes back this following year what do I need to do to settle this debt? It’s roughly $2900 and I was looking to pay at least $1800-$2000 and settle it hopefully. Any help or info would be wonderful.

personalfinance,Graduate Student in Need of Financial Assistance,"Hi Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a graduate student in my last year of education. I'm realizing that I have almost nothing planned for my future finances and desperately need help figuring out what I can afford and what I'll need for retirement. I graduate in May of 2019 as a pharmacist in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area. I'm hoping to end up working for one of the larger pharmacy chains as a staff pharmacist. I would like to stay in the rural area surrounding Grand Rapids. I would also like to purchase a home in the next few years after it turns more into a buyer's market as prices are currently outrageous. My fiance and I don't need anything fancy for our home. Our primary needs are plenty of land (20+ acres) and 2 bedrooms. We're both fairly frugal people without expensive interests. We do not want to have children. We would like to travel abroad someday and have an interest in camping/hiking/etc.

&amp;#x200B;

A brief summary of my current financial situation is as follows:

* Student loans totaling roughly $145,000 with varying interest rates from 3.8% to 7.6% (average is in the 5-6% range). Hoping to refinance after college for a lower rate.
* I also have a $300/month car payment and still owe roughly $16,000 on it at a 4.59% annual interest rate.
* I share a small apartment with my fiance and contribute $250/month towards rent and utilities.
* Have almost $0 in savings currently.
* No other outstanding debts.

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate any and all education or advice that you are willing to give. I really want to get an early start on retirement planning, but I don't really know where else to start. If I could set myself up to retire early, I would be ecstatic. Thank you in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently a sophomore in college who is trying to set up the best possible financial future. I currently have roughly $2800 in student loans, 8000 in investments, and $2000 in cash. I am a commuter college student who is also taking advantage of various scholarships at a state university to keep my per semester cost very low. I do not foresee myself having any student loans once I pay off this $2800 loan. I would like opinions on whether it would be smarter to pay off the loan first, or invest. For further clarification, I have a part time job which nets me roughly $200 bi weekly. The loan itself has a rather low interest rate; I don’t remember the exact number but I’ve accrued roughly 60 dollars on this loan and I have had the loan for about a year. Any help is greatly appreciated, and if further clarification is needed please don’t hesitate to ask. Thank you.

Edit: I believe the “loan” is technically two loans, one which has interest since inception and the other which will begin accruing interest once I graduate. The loan which is currently accruing interest is roughly $1300, while the other loan is roughly $1500.",finance

personalfinance,Question about a second account,"Hello, thanks for reading this,

I have a job now, earning actual non-grad school amounts of money. I wanted to set up a second account with a bit of savings in case my current (and only) account gets in trouble. I wanted to ask about some possible options.

From what I see, (I bank at Chase), opening a savings account doesn't seem worth it. There are limits on withdrawls/transfers and the interest rate isn't worth the hassle. I can open another general account exclusively for savings, but I would like to set something up that I could 1) possibly use in case I'm in trouble, and 2) if I don't use it have a better interest rate than 0.01-0.09%.

Anyway: thought I would ask because this is an avenue I haven't been thinking about much. I plan on spending almost all of my discretionary income on extra school loan payments but I wanted some savings on the side in case something happens, and I'd appreciate some advice as I don't know much about non-Chase bank accounts.

When the Fed raises the rate are banks not forced to raise their interest rates on corporate/consumer loans? Combine this with debt levels being at a dangerously high levels does this not spell possible disaster? I'm of the opinion that the modern generations consumer power is based on credit and with the rate hike the buying power of the working class is going to become much tighter, coupled with the fact that a majority of new jobs post-financial crisis are low paying service industry jobs. Don't just feel free to discuss, I respectfully ASK for discussion.

personalfinance,Home equity loans / HELOCs question,"Hello. Let's say based on what we're putting down, our budget for a home price is $400K.

The thing is that we're finding some houses under our budget, but they need some work.

I've been getting bombarded by Credit Karma with ""offers"" from lenders to refinance this loan. Looks like it would knock off a good chunk of interest and lower my payments 60-70 dollars a month.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm buying a commercial zoned property, a small office building, for $280k. If I take out a 2nd loan, the monthly payment will be around $1700. Obviously I would be obligated to pay both mortgages!

I've been considering the alternative of refinancing my home so that I can buy the commercial property outright in cash. I think the advantage of this would be:  


1. Only one mortgage to worry about, and less obligations per month in case I hit hard times financially.

2. All my debt is in my home loan, which has better protections, better interest rates, and tax deductions on the interest.

He was a finance guy and acted as our CPA, tax guy, financial planner, investor, etc. We're a middle class couple with one grown son. I've closed out all the ""estate"" paperwork, etc. The good news is I own my home, have no debt and a good amount of savings and retirement accounts. I'm receiving Social Security and a small federal pension as his beneficiary. I also am continuing to run my small, home-based business which provides ongoing income. The bad news is I'm feeling completely heartbroken and overwhelmed at trying to manage our financial affairs. My husband and I both grew up poor and as a result probably are very financially conservative/ careful. He had our assets spread out over 26 different accounts in various different banks and brokerage firms, with the bulk of it in just cash accounts. I'm finding it overwhelming to try to figure out how to proceed. 

I got the help of a CPA to file taxes this year and have spoken with a financial advisor she recommended. He's with Wells Fargo Advisors. I like him and overall have found his advice conservative and sensible. He says I'm in excellent shape and can invest conservatively in laddered CDs but the piechart he generated seems to show a good amount of other asset classes as well. He wanted me to come in today to set up a brokerage account and another account with WF. Something is telling me to slow down and educate myself to make sure I understand the best way to proceed. I emailed him this morning with these questions.


* Would you be acting just as my financial advisor or as my investment manager?

* If you are suggesting acting as my investment manager, how would that work and what costs would I incur?

* You said you get paid by the .04% difference between Wells Fargo's wholesale price for CDs and the retail price customers pay. Is that the only cost or are there additional fees?

* If you were to be both my financial advisor and investment manager, what are the advantages and disadvantages?

* You spoke of setting up new Wells Fargo accounts, a brokerage account and one other. Why do I need these and how would they work?

* Can you just work as a financial advisor for a fee with my being free to invest elsewhere?

* If so, what are the advantages and disadvantages of doing so?

* What degree of control do I have over my money using your services compared to how (my late husband) and I have had in the past?

personalfinance,Student loan payment strategies? I have some flexibility.,"Hello!

Hoping this is the right place to post this, but I'd love some help on strategizing my student loan payments.

Here are some details as follow:
 - I just graduated this spring and begun my full-time position a couple of months ago
 - I have two ~$1,600 loans accruing interest (~$300 on each already) because they're unsubsidized
 - These loan payments won't begin being billed until December, but I want to make a dent in them
 - They both have the same interest rate
 - I have enough savings to cover ONE of these loans as a whole before then

My mom recommends that I pay for one in full so that I only have to pay for the other once it really counts. Is it weird paying two separate ones at once? Does that come in one bill? Are there any methods in which these payments can make the best impact on my credit score? I just went down 50 points for opening a new credit card.

personalfinance,Thoughts on consolidation/balance transfer to pay off CC debt (and card recommendations for doing so),"My wife and I have been married about 1.5 years, but she is apparently not great with money at all and I am finding out just how frustrating it is to deal with. There have been some very poor decisions made with our money that I am not happy about ***(I'm surprising you for your birthday by getting your buddy a plane ticket to come visit, but instead of just saving the $250 I'm going to get a credit card with a 25% interest rate and $7500 limit and max it out before you even know it exists... but happy birthday!)*** Between that, another high interest loan from wedding expenses that we still owe around $2500 on, and then a Walmart card, Best Buy card, and Jewelry Store card that she opened we owe around 15k all together. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the biggest parts of getting our finances on track is paying all of this debt off. I have done some reading and am looking at transferring and consolidating everything onto a card with a decent length 0% introductory rate and work on getting it paid off in that time period. I have never done this before though, and don't really know how the debt transfer thing works. If I were to get one of these cards do I basically just take the new card and use it to ""make a payment"" on the old cards/accounts in order to pay them off and get that amount onto the new line of credit? What cards like this are generally the good ones to look into? Will it be an issue if some of the cards are in just her name and some have us both listed? What should I keep an eye out for in this process? I do not care at all about rewards or anything other than getting this debt paid off. We pay over $1000/mo in credit card payments, so if that 15k were on something with 0% interest I could have it paid off in less than a year without much trouble at all. I really just don't want to end up in a worse position than I am now, so I'm asking for advice. Of course there need to be changes made in our habits moving forward to ensure we don't end up in the same predicament, but my question is more or less focused on this actual process as I've never been in a situation where this has been something that needed to be researched.

TL;DR: have around 15k in credit card debt, spend more money per month on that than we do on any other expense, but it feels like the balances are not decreasing in any substantial way.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not 100% certain whether this question is appropriate as a new post, but I'm starting my first ""real"" job next year, and I've got a few kinks in my scenario that most general NerdWallet-type advice don't necessarily apply.

&amp;#x200B;

So, right now, I'm finishing my undergrad in the Northeast, graduating next spring, and I'm projected to make about $15k by the end of 2018 with my part time gig at school. I'm in my late 20's, however, because I had to serve in a foreign military and work multiple jobs to save up for my education. I plan on maximizing my Roth this year because I've budgeted enough to graduate without debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Next year, here's where I'll be:

State of Georgia

Single, no dependents

Income $90k + \~20% bonus (effective tax \~12% federal, \~5% state, no local tax)

This works out to \~$6k take home per month

Probably will pay \~$1.3k in rent + $300 in bills/utilities/insurance, etc.

Other living/entertainment expenses will typically be \~$1.5k, realistically

Company pays profit sharing (percentage of salary, say \~5%), but no 401k match

No debt, own car, around $15k in emergency fund (cash), $7k in Roth, no other savings

&amp;#x200B;

Given the above, where should I start saving for retirement/house? I take it it's probably best to max my IRA for the flexibility, but should I go for Roth or Traditional? And obviously I want to put away more, and planning on contributing \~$10k for 401k anyways, despite no match. All that would bring my take-home to around $4.5k/month. Minus rent and expenses, I'd have $1.2-1.5k/month left.

However, I'm looking to take advantage of fairly generous first home buyers options in Georgia (low rate, down-payment support, etc.) in the next 2-3 years, so I'd like to save for a down payment, probably. the 36% rule tells me I could shoot for $250-300k range for a 1.5-2 bed condo, likely. How should I go about saving for a home, and retirement at the same time?

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Paying off my second mortgage. Are these fees reasonable?,"My wife and I took out a second mortgage in the form of ""Down payment assistance"" when we bought our home. We really didnt need the money, but since it was a low interest rate our lender convinced us. Dumb mistake, but I was a first time buyer and careless with borrowing at the time. 

In any case, we've paid off all of the principle and I was surprised to get a ""payoff demand"" letter with a bunch of fees for the demand letter ($60), re-conveyance ($100), recording fee ($40), Convenience fee ($18.50), documentation fee ($12). I thought it would be like a car loan, where when I make the last payment they send me a letter saying its free and clear. 

My loan was bought and sold perhaps 4 times. Its currently held by a company that seems to primarily be a debt collector. 

The original documents state I must pay for re-conveyance, but I dont see where I agreed to pay anything else.

Is this legitimate and/or typical? Should I pay all of the fees? It seems a little scammy that I'm being forced to pay a company which I never entered into any agreement with - and the company who owns it wont answer any questions other than I must pay them or they will continue to charge me regular payments (on the debt which is paid off).

personalfinance,Best way to get out of debt?,"Hi guys!

&amp;#x200B;

I am turning 30 in about a month and have made it a goal of mine to become more financially responsible and get out of debt for good. In my 20's I've managed to rack up student loans and credit card debt mainly due to a divorce and becoming a single mom. Thanks to this community and Mint I've been able to create a pretty strict budget (that I stick to!) and I have not had to add to my credit card debt in months and have even completely paid off another. (even with a few unexpected expenses coming up like car repairs and illnesses) 

In order to reach my goal of getting out of debt faster, I will be starting a second job next month. I will bump down to 12hrs/wk at my current job of $28/hr and will be working 36hrs/wk at my new job for $50/hr. Plus opportunity for overtime and holiday pay. Plus a $1,500 sign on bonus. The new job is a ""seasonal"" position meaning it is a 17 week contract, with opportunity to resign at the rate of $50/hr for another 17 weeks or be hired on at a lower hourly rate or possibly return full time to my current job. 

Where I am needing some advice: I currently have $10k of debt on one credit card (Wells Fargo) with an interest rate of 13.74% and $6k of debt on another credit card (CitiBank) with an interest rate of 17.24%. My student loans are right at $13k. Currently I am using both the avalanche and snow ball method. What I was paying onto my Best Buy credit card and is now paid off, I am paying into my CitiiBank card. Once I pay that card off I plan on adding that to my Wells Fargo card and then eventually into my student loans. I have never been late on a payment and always try to pay more than the minimum payment. However, I still feel like I am just throwing pennies at it due to the interest. At this point, would it be recommended to consolidate my two credit cards to achieve a lower interest rate? My only concern would be having to take out another loan to do so and how it would affect my credit score. My current FICO is 710. And what is a reputable company to go through? 

Once I begin my new job, I plan on keeping my current budget and increasing my payment to CitiBank to $1,000/month and Wells Fargo to $400/month. Unless of course I decide to consolidate. The sign on bonus plus \~$1,300/month will go into a savings account. My hope is to resign my contract for another 17 weeks after the initial 17 weeks. 

ANY advice is welcome, I am pretty financially unsavvy. I do not own a home (but hope to in the next 5 years) and I do not owe anything on my car (although IS 10 years old and requires frequent repairs). Also plan to go to graduate school in the next 3 years to earn more money.

TL;DR Going to be making more money temporarily. Owe $10k on one credit card with interest rate of 13.74% and owe $6k on another credit card with 17.24% interest rate. Consolidate credit for lower interest rate or continue avalanche/snow ball method?",finance
personalfinance,Pay off student loans or start Roth IRA? Need help deciding!,"Hello people of r/pf!

All thanks this subreddit, I’ve been able to buckle down on my finances and figure out the best plan to dig my way out of debt. 

I have a 6 month emergency fund and I’m currently contributing to my 401k to receive full company match . I have no credit card debt and my car is paid off. Here is the breakdown of my student loans (all federal):

loan #1 $3738 @3.15% 
loan #2 $215 @6.55% 
loan #3 $3777 @3.61% 
loan #4 $1010 @5% 

On top of minimum payments, I am paying off an extra $885 a month (highest interest first) and as long as I stay on track, I’m set to be done by mid next year. 

My next plan is to start contributing to a Roth IRA after my student loans are paid off. My question is, because I’ll be expecting to max out Roth IRA contributions for 2019, would it be a good financial decision to start contributing now using part of the extra $885 and take a little longer on paying off my student loans? I’m only considering doing this after I pay off the two loans with the highest interest rates. Or should I just stay on my current plan, pay off all the student loans and only after, start contributing to Roth?

Thanks in advance!

\- I bank with a local credit union.

I'm looking for a type of loan that has a low interest rate because it is secured against my homes (I assume this is my best bet?).

Right off the bat, I might pay down my credit card (8k), then I would draw from loan to fill the gap when I don't even enough income from my rentals, etc.

datascience,The Data Journey: From Data to Knowledge to Intelligence,"Let me start by making a statement that most of us may find common sense: *The ultimate goal of any expedition into the Data Cosmos is to make better decisions*.

Just like a chess player, we want to not only gain valuable insights from studying and analyzing Data, but also want to be able to simulate different scenarios and pick the most favorable outcomes. Lastly, we want to monitor the results of our decisions and make adjustments as needed.

Having spent almost a decade designing and implementing all sorts of data-related solutions and services taught me that reaching what at times seems to be the ultimate pinnacle of intelligence is actually just another vantage point, soon to be dwarfed by the next question being asked. During that process we gain a deeper understanding of actual behaviors while imposing ever-increasing demands on Data. We also set even higher standards for Knowledge and Intelligence.

The more intriguing part is that we cannot engineer what we cannot define. Therefore, being able to define the Problem is where everything should begin. As we all know, these days there are plenty of challenges to address in Healthcare. Unfortunately none of these challenges are trivial, therefore having access to good quality medical data becomes increasingly valuable. It is not only the quality, but also its volume the reasons researchers find Data extremely valuable.

BitMED is on a mission to help solve some of the most pressing Healthcare challenges by building a system that we all as a society can benefit from.

personalfinance,Thoughts on Investing vs. Savings (in my situation),"Currently, I'm in the process for a federal job while working at a supermarket pretty much making min wage in NYC ~$13/hr. I get a solid 40 hours per week and take home about $430 a week. I already have $3,000 saved up and deciding what to do with it. 

My first option is a HYSA with Ally, where I want to start working towards a down payment for a coop, and make payments into my account for a few years (5-6yrs) OR my second option is to open an account with Vanguard and invest into a small/mid growth mutual fund, and make payments at the end of every paycheck and continue this until 5-6 years where there's a sizeable amount of principal and interest. (I used a compounded interest calculator to visualize this). 

I spoke to a few friends and they told me to just save all your money and buy out the coop with cash since a few years down the line I will be earning a decent wage, you won't be able to capitalize on potential gains by borrowing money/debt, BUT you will have a secure nest and THEN from that point on, once you stabilize your lifestyle, you can go aggressively invest when I start earning a decent wage.

My other friends told me to just open a mutual funds account, and continue to add a sizeable principal of $1k a month and since you want to own your own place in 5-6 years time, this allows you to make money on the side when you ""cash out"". He also tells me not to worry about the market crashing or anything, be disciplined with making continuous payments and that it's ok if you delay cashing out, at least until the market corrects itself.

I understand both ways of thinking, but I want to know if there is a more objective way of looking at this.

My situation is as this. Currently working a 13/hr job, living at home, have 3k in savings, currently half way through my federal job process, pay starts at GS5 (40k/yr), after 5 years, GS12 (90k/yr) pay. Thoughts or different angles are appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,[Saving] I think we might be overly conservative in our saving.,"Our situation:

We are a family of three. I'm 46, my wife is 42, and we have a 3 year old. I'm a stay at home parent, my wife works full time (soon to be .9) as a fairly well-paid (brought home $270k last year, but grouses constantly about how dermatologists are overpaid) doctor. Her specialty is in high demand, and she is well liked by her patients and also has received many awards for her performance, so she's pretty secure in her job.

We have ~$4 million in assets. This includes our house (~$700k, fully paid off) but not our two cars. We owe nothing on them, but I don't count them as assets. They are both in excellent condition. We have no debts at all. Our assets are broadly diversified, mostly in the stock market, but with some money in CDs. We have both maxed out our IRAs and my wife maxes out her 401k every year. We have a 529 plan that's decently funded for our 3 year old's college. We each have decent life insurance policies on each other, enough that if something happens to one of us, the other one won't have to work and can instead focus on raising our daughter. If both of us are gone, her uncle will take over for us.

My wife plans on working until she is 65. She is probably going to .9 this coming year, and will be transitioning to .75 at 50, until she retires. Her pay will adjust roughly the same amount at the time.

We don't have a hard 'n fast budget, but we are pretty darn frugal. I pulled our credit card statements (we put everything on a 2% cash back card and then pay it off every month) along with the bill pay, stuffed it all into Excel and came back with $55k total spent for the last year. This includes three week long trips to rather nice locations (think Hawaii) and a week long cruise.

When we travel, we buy food at the local grocery stores and make all our own meals. Our house is small (3 br, 1.5 stories, no real yard, no view and IMO poorly designed to fit 3 real people - and my in-laws come and live with us for 2-3 months out of the year, so it gets real cramped really quick.

Now, I'm not saying I want a Lamborghini, or a house in Beverly Hills, or to eat out every night or a personal chef. I would like to buy a house with a bit of a yard and maybe a view and maybe when we go on trips not to worry so much about not eating out to save money.

I did a quick 'n dirty spreadsheet showing how quickly our money was accumulating, and how fast we were spending it. Assuming no wage growth, 3% inflation (and then doubling our spending at 65 to account for increased travel and health expesnses) and a 6% RoI (which seems conservative) our pool of money basically never runs out, and in fact keeps growing much faster than we're spending it.

personalfinance,I am drowning in debt. Interest payments are killing me after about five years of dumb decisions. I'm trying to get my feet back underneath me and I can't stick to a budget for crap. Help.,"Alright. I am 25. I have read through the wiki. I have tried Mint, YNAB, regular Excel spreadsheets, and pre-constructed sheets I've found around this sub. I don't know what it is, nothing is helping me. So I'm trying for individualized suggestions here. 

Here's my situation. 


Shared bills (my portion only) 
* Rent: $550  
* Utilities (water, electric, internet): $90  
* Groceries (humans only): $150   
* Pets (we have nine): $100 vet care, $50 food  
* Spotify: $6  
* Weed: $80  


My bills: 
* AT&amp;T: $55  
* Car insurance: $77.61  
* Car payment: $223.42   
* Student Loan #1: $200.33  
* Student Loan #2: $120  
* Gas: $150  
* Credit Card #1: $50  
* Credit Card #2: $60  
* Credit Card #3: $220  
* Credit Card #4: $25  
* Personal loan: $261.11  
* iPhone Upgrade Program: $32.41 (this month is my last payment and then I will own my phone outright finally)  

Other debts: 
Medical: $480.67 (this debt is almost a year old. I pay what I can when I can and they've been gracious enough to not send me to collections)

Each paycheck is $1500 and I get two a month usually (sometimes three depending on the month). Adding all of that up (excluding the medical debt), I have to pay $2,500.88 in expenses. So I *should* have $500 left over per MONTH and I don't. My interest rates are killing me. Every credit card is a 20%+ APR and that one that I pay over $200/month on has a monthly interest charge of about $180 so at this rate I'm going to be paying it off forever. Also, every card that I've used is maxed out currently after I quit a lucrative job to follow my dreams a little while ago and the ex who was supposed to pick up the slack on our finances decided to hang me out to dry so I ended up having to use my credit cards for things like food and gas. So my debt:income ratio is outrageous and even OneMain looked at my pre-app for a debt consolidation loan and laughed at me. 

What's really screwing me up is that every time I write all of this down, it seems like I should have plenty. It's incredibly discouraging. I also don't want to seem like I'm not taking responsibility for my situation. I didn't have to go to a school that expensive, I didn't have to open a credit card with Apple to buy my best friend a computer for art school, I didn't have to open a personal loan to pay down a card that I promptly maxed out again. I have terrible impulse issues and I am willing to do just about anything to help out a friend, including give them money I don't have. I'm getting better about all of that but the person I was between the ages of 20 and 24 has dug a giant hole and punted my butt into it. 

Oh, and I picked up a side hustle delivering pizza which starts tomorrow. I'm planning on funneling every penny of that directly into the credit cards. 

I want to clarify something on the weed front. I know that for a lot of people that would seem like a luxury but I actually need it to eat.  I was in an abusive relationship for a couple of years and now for some reason, I can't eat more than 2-3 bites of food without vomiting unless I've smoked. I've gone and had my stomach and throat scoped and they found nothing. Physically I look normal. I adjusted my diet, I cut out gluten, dairy, alcohol. I lost almost 40 pounds from not being able to eat. I don't smoke socially or just to get high, it's not just a thing I do for fun. So please don't tell me to cut this out because I basically can't.

Help. Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,You DO want your spouse to co-sign your FedLoan if you are both doing income-based repayment with loan forgiveness. Spouse is not responsible for repaying your loan and it doesn’t mean your income increases. It only means they take your spouse’s loan burden into account when calculating yours.,"This applies if you and your spouse are part of the public service loan forgiveness program (eg 10 years of making payments while working for a 501c3 not-for-profit).  To qualify, you must choose an income-based repayment plan and re-certify your income annually.  It is also a good idea to have your employer sign a document annually. I’m sure there are other situations that apply to this as well.

My spouse thought that having me co-sign would be a bad idea.  He just assumed without thinking about what co-signing was for.  He therefore ended up with a payment of $1,000 a month.  When he re-applied with me co-signing and verifying my loan burden, the payments were half as much.",finance
personalfinance,7 ARM vs 30 Year Fix .,"We are purchasing home in HCOL with 1.17 M mortgage. We are getting 3.625 for 7 ARM vs 4.25% for 30 year fix for the amount we are borrowing. Payment difference  between 30 year and 7 ARM is about $400  (5,301 for 7 ARM vs 5,718 for 30 year). We would like to pay off this home in less than 30 years if possible. Most likely 15-20 years .  

One Idea we had was to go with 7 year arm and keep pumping additional payments till next 7 year and reduce our loan balance. We refinance between year 5 -  7 depends on where interest rates are. This strategy assumes we will be able to lock lower interest rate within next 6 years. We do not want to wait till last year until it is definitive that rates will be lower before our reset hit.

  
Other things to consideration is that if we refinance in next 5-6 years, we will be resetting our amortization and paying more interest in beginning. Given that interest rates are going up, should we lock in lower 30 year fix or try to bet on future lower rates while we pay additional principle. ?

personalfinance,Repayment advice needed please!,"Hey PF, first time poster because I’m in a bit of a rough place and could use some advice regarding student loans (a popular topic, I know!).
I attended public university from 2012-2016. During this time, I took out Federal loans, one Perkins loan, and a private loan all under my name.
Currently (after making some payments/paying off two of the higher interest loans), the total amount I still owe under MY name is ~$24,000 with varying interest rates no greater than 6%.
Unfortunately that’s not the end of the story! 
The loans I was approved for and the few scholarships I got during college were not enough to cover the costs of school and rent.
My parents offered to take out Parent Plus loans in order to ensure I had enough coverage each semester for tuition, rent, books, etc. so I would only have to work part time while in school. The agreement was always that I would just pay back the portion used for school after I graduated and got an established career.
At the time, they were in a bit of credit card debt and decided to take out more than just what I would need for school, and they used the excess portion of the Parent Plus loan refunds to “pay off” these debts. I wasn’t worried about this, because my costs were covered and they ensured me that I would only be responsible for paying back my specific portion.
Since I graduated, I started making payments on my own loans almost immediately. I would repeatedly ask my parents to look up the total amount for the Parent Plus loans so I would know how much I owed in total.
After over two years, I finally had to stand over their shoulder and have them show me the number because they would “forget” to look it up every time I asked.
Well, drum roll........$80,000 just in Parent Plus loans that they’ve been deferring for two years.
I was shocked and angry, but I digress. What’s done is done.
They say I owe them half, and when I did the math regarding tuition and rent over those years the numbers add up. 
So my grand total shoots up to ~$64,000 owed.
My question is: where do I go from here?
Should I focus on the loans under my name and let them continue to defer on the Parent Plus loan until I can pay towards it? Or start making payments to them now? Or can I go through the bank and have the $40,000 debt on my name rather than paying my parents directly? 
So sorry for the wall of text, just feeling lost and a bit defeated and would really appreciate any insight!

TL;DR: My anticipated student loan payback amount just shot up by an additional $40,000 and I don’t know where to go from here.",finance
personalfinance,DH and I are planning out our long-term goals and would like to start saving to have a baby in a few years. Where do we start?,"Hi, all. Husband and I are newlyweds, new college grads (early twenties), and fortunate enough to be financially stable with pretty much guaranteed jobs (he's military, I have a federal job). We have a two-year plan to pay off student loans and car and to beef up our emergency fund, but after that time, we find ourselves with roughly $3200 every month that isn't earmarked for anything (retirement and other savings goals are already accounted for). 

While we aren't ready for children right now, we would like to be in 5-10 years and would appreciate any input on how to get started and what a good savings goal would be. The plan is at least two of our own and perhaps adopting a third.

personalfinance,[Auto] Refinance now or wait for credit score to rise?,"This post is actually pertaining to my brother's situation but he asked me for advice and I didn't know the best answer as I haven't dealt with very many auto loans especially with a credit score like his.  


So here is the background on the situation:  About 8 months ago my brother was in a car accident that was not his fault and his car was totaled.  He had very poor credit (~470 FICO) and bought a mildly used car (a few years old) for about $15,000 with $3,000 down with an absurd interest rate of nearly 25%.  He was told that after 6 months with no late payments he would be able to refinance (the dealership financed the car in-house because he was turned down by everyone else) and they would do so with no additional finance fees.


About 4 months in he paid off all of his outstanding negative credit items (about $2k in debt when settling at reduced prices).  He also opened a secured credit card about 5 months in.  When he went to refinance the car after his 6th payment he had a credit score of ~570.  He was told by the finance person at the dealership that refinancing it would only reduce his monthly payments by $20 to $30 per month.  He attempted to get a loan via the Credit Union he banks with and he was rejected as well.

At the start of the month his FICO score (according to Credit Karma's score estimate) was 620 which is also the level the the Dealership's finance person told him to come back at.  My question is whether he would be best off refinancing after this month's bill cycle (1 additional car payment and 1 additional credit card statement with the ""optimal"" balance level) or if he should set a higher credit score target before refinancing.


He is able to handle the monthly payments at the current insane interest rate but he would obviously like to get the interest rate down but if he would get significant savings by waiting a couple more months then that would be the better route.  Given the speed his credit score has been increasing at, I feel that a conservative estimate would be that he is gaining ~10 points at least per month (although maybe that will be slowing down going forward?).  At the end of the month he would be at 9 car payments with a perfect payment history and 3 months with his credit card holding an optimal balance level.  So for those knowledgeable on the subject I would appreciate any advice that I could pass on to him.  Thank you in advance for your feedback!


If anyone had any recommendations on lenders to consider that offer attractive interest rates to someone with his credit history/score I would appreciate that as well!",finance
personalfinance,Ally Bank website design/account questions,"I'm interested in changing to Ally bank from CO360 for the higher interest rate and I need to confirm how Ally displays accounts and summaries and if I can have multiple savings under the same account before I go through the application process. I need at least 25 sub savings accounts under the same account and would prefer to see a simple list of my accounts with the balances and total information on a single page. I also need the ability to download transaction history/total via .csv. 

I used to enjoy these features prior to the CO360 site update earlier this year. Instead of a simple list I now have oversized blue boxes with white text and poor contrast that requires too much scrolling. I used to see all my accounts including the total of all my monies on a single 'page' of my browser before the UX changed. In it's current form the site is unusable. Worse yet, CO360 hasn't raised rates and I'm only earning 1% and I see Ally is up to 1.9%. I want to earn more and I want a desktop friendly interface.

I am open to other banks that fit my requirements: usable desktop interface, higher than CO360 interest rates for small savings (under $10k), and the ability to have multiple designated savings accounts under a single account. I have a Barclay savings which does have higher rates, but the interface isn't as desktop friendly as I'd prefer and seems to limit sub savings to 5. 

Edit: 
Thanks for the responses. Ally looks like it will work out for me.",finance

personalfinance,"When doing the ""right"" thing financially bites you in the rear","My husband and I are decently frugal.  We spend way more on eating out than we should (our waistlines don't thank us), but we live modestly and within our incomes, while still saving for retirement and an emergency fund.

6 weeks ago my 2009 Hyundai Accent had the timing belt go while driving down the highway (I had replaced it at 60,000 miles as recommended, and still had 10k before the next replacement, but such is life...).  Now, we have two young kids that have big car seats, that car is TINY, and it doesn't have power windows or locks.  But it's paid for.  My husband and I thought long and hard and decided to pay the $1200 we were quoted to fix it rather than buy another car.  Figured we'd try to get a few more years out of my Accent and his 1996 Acura.  Off to the shop it went...not to be seen again for nearly a month.  One thing after another happened.  Damage was worse than anticipated.  Parts had to be fabricated at a machine shop.  Hurricane Florence hit.  Another part was broken and could ONLY be found at scrapyards.  The first two scrapyards sent the wrong parts.  Finally got the car back, and now the check engine light is on and the acceleration is so bad we can't drive it on the highway.  Needs a solenoid, which will take another week to come in, and adds another $300 to the $2k we already spent fixing this car.

Finally put my foot down and demanded that I get a new car.  While we *could* have paid outright for the used car I got yesterday (thanks emergency fund!) we decided to put $4k down and finance the other $7k.  Got a 6 seater, 5 year old car with 40k miles that was deemed in great condition by our mechanic.

So, in the vein of being fiscally responsible we decided to fix the car I already have, and instead spent $13k on a new car and repairs for a (still non-functioning) car.  So much for trying to do the right thing.

P.S.- We bank at our local credit union, which offers a 5.25% rate on used cars, no matter the credit.  I have stellar credit and was told the best interest rate they could find at the dealership was 4.44%.  Seems a bit high, but then again I haven't needed a car loan in 8 years.  Worth it to shop around some more and transfer my car loan?  How does that work?",finance
personalfinance,Private student loans refinancing: pay off interest first?,"Hey all,

I have 2 private student loans, each being $40,000. I have another $38,000 in federal loans.

My monthly payment for one private loan will be $850 for 5 years and the other will be $315 per month. I think if I do the pay as you earn for the federal loans, that’s an additional $200.

I currently make $3,400 a month, and with my other living expenses I feel that paying $1,365 a month is wayyy to much. 

I have gotten refinancing rates of around $550 a month for my private loans, so $750 a month is an improvement. I honestly will probably never pay off these loans as I am likely to return to school for a doctorate degree and go into more debt.

My friend suggested I pay off the interest I’ve collected while I’ve been in school. Is there a benefit to doing this prior to refinancing? Should I keep my loans separate and refinance just one of them? TIA",finance

The Signature loan has an interest rate of 13.75% and the amount owed is less than what would max out the credit card. The credit card has an interest rate of 12.74%. Would combining the debts into the credit card of lower interest be the best course of action? Thanks for your time.",finance

personalfinance,FedEx customs tax/shipping do I really have to pay??,"Hi, sorry if this does not belong here but worth a shot

1.5 years ago I bought a computer part online over from a redditor at /r/hardwareswap where he asked for a price and stated that the price includes shipping. I pm'ed him about me living in Canada and he said that he is okay with shipping it to me if I added 5$ to the asking price. Fine by me,  I agreed and the order was shipped to me and I received it the following week. 2 weeks later I receive an invoice for 51$ from FedEx for the package I picked up. I thought this has to be a mistake so I messaged the redditor back and he said to ignore it and ""it was fine"". I believed him because I would think it would be absurd to just ask someone to pay 51$ after just dumping a package at their house and leaving.   

Fast forward 1.5 years and I receive another email from a debt collecting company regarding the invoice FedEx has sent me back then. They demand I pay the 51$ immediately within 10 days or they will take ""further action"". First of all, the contents of the package isn't even worth more then 51$ and second of all, why is that allowed? If a random person were to send me a rock in a package and fedex threw it at my doorstep would I be forced to pay a 51$ fee? I'm still a young adult so I don't really know much about this stuff but I find this totally bullshit that they can put a 51$ charge on me with no consent from me whatsoever. I have bought 5-6 other parts off other people on the same sub and they also shipped from US to Canada with no issues at all.  Is there anything I can do to get out of paying this charge? Any feedback or help is greatly appreciated,.

TL:dr Ordered item that ""included shipping"" online. Received package and received a 51$ invoice from fedex.",finance

personalfinance,Budget Debt + Savings,"Hi, 

I've been struggling with spending above my means and impulse shopping. I've said no more and hid all my credit cards inside my sock drawer and haven't touched them since last month (small victory I know). I'd like some help with how you all stop those impulse purchases (I've done a lot better but going grocery shopping in and of itself has ended up with some ""Extras"" in my cart historically) as well as allocating money for debt/savings a bit better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to pay down debt more aggressively and am aiming for around $650-700 payments a month for cc and keep the minimum $320 payments for the student loans, this will be the first month I try this but I've been decently on track. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part of my issue is that my savings is kind of small and I feel uncomfortable if anything were to happen. I'm saving $200/month but I've been hit with sudden expenses that have drained my savings twice in the last 12 months already. Should I be saving a bit more a month or just leave it as 200? And should I also be saving for expected future expenses   
(annual vet visits and apartment moving expenses both are 7-12 months away)? I've checked out the flow and it says to save about 1 months worth of expenses. Should I go ahead and do that this month and then switch to paying larger amounts towards the cc? Or not at this point in time? 

Thanks! My budget is below: 

**Bi Weekly Pay of $1,692 after taxes (Total $3,384)**  I'm putting in 3% to 401k currently (employee matches 100% up to 5% IF they are in the positive revenue and can afford it but it's been a pretty rough year for us) 

**Debt**: 

	• $27,000 in Student Loans ( Interest \~4.06%)

	• $11,000 in CC debt (Transferred to a credit card with 0% interest for 8 months)

Total: $38,000

**Monthly Fixed Expenses:**

	• (1) Rent: $750

	• (1) Electric: $45-50 (split 89-100 with SO)

	• (1) Internet: $21 (split 42 with SO)

	• (15) Car Payment: $100 (Prius)

	• (15)Car Insurance: $110 

	• (10) Renters Insurance: $15 

	• (15) Pet Insurance: $57

	• (10-12) Misc Entertainment (Sling, Moviepass): \~$25 (split sling with SO and moviepass is $10 for 3 movies a month)

	• (15) Phone: $45

	• (15) Federal Loans: $320

	• Savings: $200 / Month (I have about $1050 saved up right now)

Total: $1,693

**General Expenses:** *Goal is to keep this lower than $1,000/month, I started ""giving"" myself $250/week (Friday - Friday) for General expenses. Then rolling over the unused amount this last paycheck (sept 28) and just ""topping"" my account back off to $250. I had 45 left over last week so I went over by $36. I've found balancing it weekly helps me keep things more in check since I'm working with low numbers and get paranoid when the #'s fall below $100 in my account.  I'm hoping this technique works since the other methods I've tried haven't so far.* 

	• Groceries: \~$175 (350 split between 2 people is the ideal)

	• Auto Expenses: $150 ($110 for Gas, $40 for Toll)

	• Date Money:  $160/month (40/week- we've been under budget last 2 months at around $20/week or less)

	• ""Me"" Money (Haircuts, Personal Care, clothing (work and personal), misc ""fun""): $80/month

	• Misc Housing expenses: $15/month 

	• Dogs: 

		○ $45/month for food for 2 dogs (One big bag lasts about 8 weeks+ $10 for chew/training treats), 

		○ \~$35 for Trifexis/month (bought 6 months supply 

	• Gifts: $15

personalfinance,Need help with IRS withholding calculator,"Hello!

I'm from California, very new to taxes and trying to calculate my withholding allowances and additional withholdings.  I tried to use the IRS withholding calculator, but I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly.  

I had an independent contracting job on a 1099 that ended at the end of January where I made $4k.  I've been job hunting ever since and was able to find a job across the country in Ohio.  The new job pays $63k with a $3.5k relocation package, but the relocation is accumulated during the move and reimbursed later on the first paycheck so it could be lower if I don't use all of it during my relocation.

The new job starts at the end of October/early November and it's asking for three separate withholding allowances and additional withhholdings for federal tax, work state tax, and home state tax, which I'm completely lost on.  Any help with calculating these is greatly appreciated.  Also, I put California as my home address for now, but I'm in the process of moving to Ohio in the next couple of weeks so would home state tax be calculated for Ohio or California?

Thank you!

personalfinance,Filing bankruptcy and need help with decisions regarding our car/loan,"As the title says, I am about 2 to 3 weeks of filing my Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. I have to make some decisions in these next few months after filing and I want to make sure I make the best decisions financially for my family. I appreciate any feedback and opinions.

Some background. We are a family of 3 with myself being the sole income earner, my husband is a stay at home dad to our 3 year old. I make 65k a year and we live in a state with a decent cost of living. 

A few things that, while I know comes from a place of trying to help, we won't be able to change for a while. First, my husband won't be able to get a full time job until after our daughter is in 1st grade, and then maybe only seasonal until she is able to be home alone (my job requires me be available day and evenings at any given time). A part time job will be possible and he will be getting when she does finally go to school, but that is about 2 to 3 years away). Additionally, a part time job is not something I can consider either due to the need to be flexible (should an emergency arise that I need to go to a site for, I can't say I can't because I'm at my other job, unless of course I don't want to keep my full time job). 

So here are a few things that I need to make some decisions on regarding our current car and would really appreciate opinions from people who are good with these kind of things, specifically regarding our bankruptcy.

1. Currently we only have one car. We owe 10K on it and is probably worth 7K at the most and probably less due to it having some mechanical issues. Payments are $300 a month. We are a month behind on the payments but will catch up once the BK is filed. After some research, it is very likely the company will let us keep the car payments current and they won't repo without a reaffirmation agreement. But should we? The car is nearly 7 years old, has some issues, and is a few thousand under water. The considerations here are these: 
   1. We have options to work with a local reputable dealership who specializes in BK financing and who could get us into a late model car with no money down but an interest rate of up to 15% although it could be less depending on when we fiance. If we wait until after discharge, we could save ourselves on the interest rate, but they won't know until then how much.
   2. We have no money saved and no way to save up enough for a good used car to buy outright  within the next few months. I can't risk not paying my car payments to save that money and they get a relief from stay so they can take the car. No car = no job for me. I have to keep paying and I have get current all very shortly after filing. 
   3. We could try for a redemption using a redemption lender and paying a settled amount with the finance company. Issue is, we have been told, is that at almost 7 years old, we may have trouble finding a redemption lender to fiance this endeavor.
   4. We are taking the car into a mechanic to have them look at it to find out what is wrong with it. Of course the worry is the cost that it would be to fix. We won't be able to fix anything wrong with it right now (and it does run fine), but may be able to once we are finally caught up with all our bills and paying on time for everything else. Considering the BK, at what point should I consider the cost to fix the car not worth it?
   5. If we do not reaffirm (which we won't be doing for sure) and keep the car, if the car gets to a point where the cost to fix it is too great, and we voluntarily surrender the car back to the finance company, does this appear as a negative mark on my credit even though the loan was discharged in the bankruptcy? This really scares me. The whole point is to dig out of the credit mess we put ourselves in.

The car is currently our number one concern right now. We have no other options and I can't buy a beater with a heater in the meantime that could potentially not start on a cold day or break down. The current car runs just fine and there is no concern about it not being able to get where it needs to go. We can also afford the payments of $300 to $350 and if we do finance another car, we would stay within that payment budget as well. Our attorney agrees that there is no way we should sign a reaffirmation agreement, but doesn't really have an opinion on financially what we should do about the car. What are the best financial options that we have here?",finance

* Currently do not have any children. We are not necessarily trying to have one, but it is possible.
* I have around $120 invested in various stocks and mutual funds. I have also received several thousand shares of stock and my company recently IPO'd. I am not fully vested and currently have anywhere from $12k-$16k available on any given day depending on the market. As of today the total projected value of all of my RSUs is $92k. I fully vest in 3 years. Since they are RSUs I pay tax on them as income, hence there isn't much liquidity available right now. I receive more RSUs every quarter.
* We have $22k in savings as of today.
* We have no debt. All of our savings was spent paying off any and all debt and student loans. 
* My wife has very good credit, mine is OK to good.
* We live fairly basic and do not have many expenses. We spend most of our money on travel.
* A house purchase would be nice, but is super unlikely given where we live (SF Bay Area). We were hoping to save my investments for a downpayment.
* Estimated time spent in the van during the year would be about 80-100 days.

______

With that said we are looking at buying a cargo van to convert to a camper van. Right now we are out of town traveling and/or camping almost every weekend and I can do a lot of remote work. If we have a kid and still want to go camping we would have to upgrade our primary car regardless since it barely fits all of our equipment and our dog. We would like to purchase sooner rather than later as we have a lot of trips planned for the winter. Also, we are going to visit my parents and my father is able to help outfit the van as we do not have the facilities to do so. Christmas vacation is the only time we can get off to make this trip. 

Also, it would enable several trips before we have children so urgency is a factor. For these specific trips camping is not necessarily easy or possible due to changes in nightly weather conditions so we would have to pay for lodging and airfare.

Our options are:

 1. Buy used for around $24k in low mileage, good condition. This would mean spending most or all of our savings.
 2. Put a sizable downpayment on a used van and take a loan for the rest.  Current loan rates are 4.77%, so we would end up paying around $12k in interest over 36mo.
 3. Buy a new van, which are ~$36k-$44k. We could put a larger downpayment down and pay a lower loan rate and pay off the loan within a year at our current savings rate. The advantage here is that we could get slightly lower interest rates of 3.8%-4.22% and thus have almost the same interest if we use the same 36 month time period.
 4. Wait until we can pay it fully in cash and potentially miss out on opportunities in the meantime.
 5. Pay cash up front using money from my investment portfolio. While this means less for a downpayment on a house, we can't honestly say that either the house or van is a higher priority given the current housing market in our area.  Also, although there are taxes for this option, they are lower than interest through any type of auto loan.

If anyone has any other opinions that are not options I will add them to this list.",finance

crypto_currency,Buyingcom - PROBLEM DESCRIPTION..,"# E-Commerce Landscape

  The current ecosystem for e-commerce has evolved from the mid-90s during the first wave of Internet technologies, with most major brands and retailers maintaining a web and mobile e-commerce presence. In addition, several dominant players such as Amazon.com, Walmart.com, and others have emerged for mass market retailing of a wide variety of products.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE** **NUMBERS** **SAY** **IT** **ALL**

  The B2B e-commerce market is one of the largest markets in the world, estimated at $7.7 trillion in the U.S. in 2017, according to Statista. Much of the market’s growth will come from digital commerce. The researcher reports that B2B e-commerce is triple the  size of the consumer e-commerce market, which was $2.3 trillion in 2017 (see chart, page 3).

   Despite the tremendous market growth, e-commerce has two major, and closely related challenges —  the inability of small retailers and consumers to obtain the lowest possible pricing by purchasing directly from manufacturers, paired with the inability of manufacturers and other wholesalers to efficiently ship product to smaller retailers and consumers.

The U.S. consumer e-commerce is dominated by Amazon.com, which has an estimated 44% of total U.S. e-commerce market. The B2B e-commerce storefront market is served by three major players: Shopify, BigCommerce, and Volusion, with BigCommerce taking up nearly 90%of the entire market space for themselves.

# Current State

If one were to deconstruct the e-commerce ecosystem, it would involve several moving parts and dominant players in the segment:

`Storefronts— Shopify.com.`

&gt;**Payment** **Processing—** Paypal, Stripe. **Shipping** **and** **Fulfillment—** FedEx, UPS. **Backoffice** **processing—** Salesforce.com.

As more consumers go online to buy products each day, the demand for e-commerce continues to grow. However, inefficiencies persist in this segment, which includes:

`Last Mile Distribution:`

&gt;This is a problem not only for small retailers but big retailers as well. Amazon has recently purchased Toys R’ Us and Whole Foods to some extent to expand their distribution channels. Even then last mile peer to peer microdistribution is not yet a reality.

`Purchasing Power:`

&gt;While more consumers go online to purchase goods and services, there is no efficient mechanism to consolidate their purchases to derive wholesale pricing.

`Fragmentation:`

&gt;Smaller retailers do not have the access to a vertically integrated service platform to pose a serious threat to larger retailers such  as Amazon. This results in them having to use a fragmented set of services as shown above.

personalfinance,Chiropractor keeps billing me - Pay them?,"Hi Personal Finance!

I really hope this is within the rules - I did check them - Mods, please  let me know if I need to add or edit anything...

So I'm a 40(M), have good credit (740 range), own a condo, pay my bills on time, have really managed to keep my credit and finances in check from a few missteps over the years (thanks to PF!).  

Here's where I need advice:  About a year ago, I started developing some shoulder pain (now I know it's because of bad posture/not stretching).  So I went to a local Chiropractor.  They accepted my insurance, but there was a co-pay of around $60.  No problem.  

As it goes with Chiropractors, they fed me the lines... ""It'll get better with treatment, we'll schedule you for next week...""  I ended up going about 7 times over a month and half.  

At around the 4th visit, I'm told that my co-pay is actually higher, and it's around $80.  Which meant I had to back-pay the earlier visits.  I figured it was helping (it was, a little bit), so I paid the difference.  

At the 7th visit, my shoulder pain bounced back, and I was back at square one.  I figured I was wasting money going there for what basically amounts to massages and ice pack treatments.  Plus, I had to travel the next week, so I told them ""I'll let you know when I can schedule the next appointment"".  Never went there again.  

A couple of weeks ago, I receive a bill from them for the 7 visits between March-May, stating I owe $200.  The bill looked really shady, printed from what looked like a home printer, with no real doctor office letterhead.  I figured ""Spam"" and ripped it up, threw it away. 

This week, I receive another bill, this time with the Dr. office letterhead, on slightly better looking font, specifying the same amount of $200.  

So my questions:  Should I suck up and pay the $200?  Should I let it go to Collections and take the credit hit, then dispute requesting a Debt Validation?  

My worries are that if I pay them, they will come after me for more, especially after I already paid for each visit, and my insurance has paid them, but somehow they are asking for more much later after the last visit.  Then again, if I don't pay them, I don't want it to negatively affect my credit score...  What do you all think?",finance

Correcting my credit has been costly, obviously, and I don't have much cash to play with now. 

The plan is to trade in the car and get into a new loan at a great interest rate. 

Would it be better for me to pay down the underwater loan or put this towards the down payment? 

My (uneducated guess) would be that it would be better to increase the size of my down payment. Does it not matter? Are there any factors I'm not thinking of?",finance

personalfinance,"Over 150k in CC loans, best options?","Hello all.. As title says, my family have 100k debt in CC loans.  The reason of this outstanding amount was due to our family having been well off for past few years, increased our monthly expenditures and when both me and my mother (father retired) was laid off suddenly we resorted to CC (money transfers and expenses) for temporary relief until we were back on the job.

&amp;#x200B;

As that went on for longer than expected time, we accrued 150k in CC debts.  We are barely managing to pay off all CC minimum payments, by cutting all expenses down but it still requires about 6k for monthly minimum payments.  Along with house rents and car payments (car is a lease), monthly expense is at 10k a month and my parents(father is working again) and I make barely 10k a month (after tax).  So in a current state, we have to use credit cards (that were paid minimum) for our living expenses, which doesn't help paying off the debt.  This spans through about 20 credit cards, about 6 cards (50k) under my name, and 14 cards (100k) under my mother's name.  All of their interest rate is really high, from 16\~22%.

&amp;#x200B;

I would need at least 1k to 2k a month room to start paying off CCs as snowball method. and was what I was aiming for but earning more is bit hard at current situation, and even just paying minimum CC payments is hard to catch up for current income.

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought was resorting to debt relief companies (such as National Debt Relief) but many posts here seems to say no to them.  I wouldn't want to try their way of practice myself, since I would be bombarded with phone calls and mails with lawsuit threats from 20 different credit card companies which is bit too much to handle when working full time. Most of credit cards are late on their payment yet, maybe 1 or 2 late for this month.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if just calling each credit cards and ask them for lower monthly payment would work better in this case, since I can manage to pay them if I can lower monthly minimum payments?

&amp;#x200B;

I am also considering to file for bankruptcy if that is better idea but I have no extensive knowledge on that. If filed for bankruptcy, it would be for only my mother. But I do want to avoid this way if possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please share your wisdom.  I know our family have been resorting to dumb financial means, and we are working hard to fix this and pay the debt. Thank you for reading!

personalfinance,Trying to calculate the future value of an extra dollar towards my mortgage payment.,"Hello everyone. I'm a youngish homeowner with plenty of runway ahead of me to pay off a mortgage and save for retirement. I enjoy reading personal finance and investing books. I got curious and was wondering how much money I was actually saving by putting an extra dollar towards my mortgage. I found a formula for the future value with compound interest on investopedia (FV=I*([1+R]^t) where I is the initial investment, R is the rate, and T is the number of years.

My mortgage has 28 years left. The interest rate is 4.25%. Using this formula I calculate that the future value of a dollar at that rate, over that time period is $3.21. Is that correct?

If so does that mean an extra dollar towards my mortgage saves me $2.21?

So I use my credit card to pay it and did so using Western Union, and I thought I would be fine. I paid off my statement balance of $429 by October 5 as I was told. Today I check my account and I see that I have been charged $1.81 in interest. When I called my credit card company they said that was interest being charged on the cash advance that I made last month. I was confused, and then they explained that the money that I used to pay for my car note is technically considered a cash advance and it carries an interest rate of 24.74%.

I didn’t know this at all, and I feel like an idiot. I just opened my credit card and the one goal was to avoid having to pay any interest. I have a 0% APR on all purchases until next year. Apparently this does not apply to cash advances.

My current balance right now and the amount that is due by November 5 is $480 roughly. Would it just be best to pay everything down to zero so I can avoid paying interest? How does this work? I plan on calling my credit card company tomorrow and have them explain what this all means. My goal is to pay off my card in its entirety by the end of next week and then I honestly never want to use it again.

I also wanna add that I know this would not have happened if I had an emergency savings fund.

personalfinance,Should we plan to move out of our ultra-expensive area?,"My wife and I have had the incredible blessing of being born in North America. We are trying to figure out what to do with the many options we are afforded. Our main goals are to raise at least one child, contribute to our community and the world, and be reasonably happy. **I don't want us to feel poor all our lives due to bad financial decisions.** There are several factors that will inform our decision whether to leave the Vancouver, BC, Canada region or to stay:

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial** 

My wife (28) will finish school in the spring of 2020 with a degree in a health care field which pays roughly $100,000/yr. Job prospects are the best in British Columbia, where we currently live. The other similar province in terms of pay and scope of practice is Ontario. 

&amp;#x200B;

I (32) make approx $60,000 a year before tax working for the municipal government. I made a recent career change and will continue to earn small increases in pay as time goes on, as well as a solid pension and benefits. I can work anywhere that has any type of municipal government. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife's student debt when she's finished school will be approx $160,000. We do not have significant assets or investments. We will not receive inheritance or family assistance any time soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

The average rent for a 1 bedroom apt here is approx $1900 a month, about $1500 in the suburbs (30min-1.5hrs out). The average price to own a 1 bedroom apt is approx $500,000 ($400,000 in suburbs). To own/rent something larger (2 bedrooms, something with a yard, etc) is significantly more ($2400+ in city). Vancouver has the highest cost of living in Canada, mostly due to property prices, and is top 10 in the world. Our rental vacancy is 0%. There are government programs being enacted to decrease offshore buying and increase rental stock, but they will take a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Regulations recently happened in Canada that has caused a crunch on the ""lower cost"" properties (under $1M) as even those with high earnings don't qualify for mortgages. (The banks are getting worried as with the low interest rates, people holding $1M+ mortgages would likely default if/when the rate increases). Thus, inventory is low and much more attractive buyers than us are snapping these up. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife is not a ""finances"" person and essentially defers to me on how to manage things since I'm a bit more seasoned at budgeting. I'm pretty financially conservative and would not feel comfortable leading us into a large debt without proper means to pay it. I don't want to be in debt all our lives due to exorbitant cost of living; that seems silly. I didn't grow up poor but to me, a household income of $100k+ is a lot of money and should be able to afford a decent life. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Social/Access**

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I both have rare but very treatable medical conditions that require regular access to specialists. For this reason, it would be difficult for us to live in very rural areas, or very far away (4+ hours) from major cities. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are both relatively liberal and would like to live in a place where different ideologies can co-exist somewhat peacefully.  Much of Canada, thankfully, is like this, but very conservative areas won't work for us. 

&amp;#x200B;

We both have one parent living in the area. My parent is mobile (willing and interested to move elsewhere), hers is not. All of our other family (siblings, nieces/nephews, cousins, extended family) is in Ontario and surrounding areas and will not be leaving anytime soon, if ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Long-Term Goals**

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned above, we would like to raise one or more children. We both were fortunate to grow up in suburban areas with access to nature and in families that were relatively financially stable (very few unmet needs, financially speaking). We would like to offer that experience to our children. We don't want them to be spoiled or entitled but it would be nice if we could provide for them. Personally, I don't envision us raising children in a downtown core for social and financial reasons, as well as quality of the schools. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have talked about the possibility of one of us staying home/working from home (likely me due to income) to raise kids. It would be really awesome to be able to afford to do this. There is literally no way we could pull it off in the current housing market in the Vancouver area without severely affecting our long-term financial health (ie not being able to retire without amazing financial acrobatics). 

&amp;#x200B;

We would like to own a home, at some point, for stability reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

We would like to be able to give back in the way of donating our money and time. With rent/mortgage + debt repayment + living expenses in Vancouver, we'd be looking at both of us working (so either put off having kids or pay $2k/mo for the near zero vacancy childcare in town), and having little to nothing left at the end of the month to save/invest. There would be very little extra time or money to give. Neither of us care about being rich at all, we just want to be stable and comfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Many of our friends and people we know have left Vancouver. It's become sort of a social phenomenon here for people to ""break up"" with the city and pursue life (and raising families) in more affordable areas. We don't want to make a rash decision but also want to be pointed towards some type of goal/plan as my wife would need to be laying the foundation for the career move (by taking practicums in another province, for example).

BlockChain,"A Kandinsky, at the forefront of new forms of financing","# Kandisky, a Russian painter precursor of abstract art, could not imagine that in 2018, one of his paintings would also be a precursor to a new way of trading and financing himself with art. And one of his paintings has also become, a century later, the precursor of the democratization of the economy.

[Token Develop](https://tokendevelop.com/en/), in collaboration with art appraisers, has fragmented this painting into art tokens to allow all investors who wish to be part of this revolution. But what is this revolution?

For starters, there are different types of assets, such as precious metals, or real estate and even works of art. All of them have one thing in common and that is that they are revalued over time. However, not all people are able to acquire the asset in its entirety, due to lack of capital, inexperience...

Nowadays, thanks to [Blockchain](https://tokendevelop.com/en/increase-business-investment-in-blockchain-projects/) networks and decentralized systems, we are living the democratization of financing. It is an open system where everyone can access as equals (P2P). In addition, you have the opportunity to invest from anywhere in the world in a convertible asset in chips or **tokens**.

In this way, both geographical and bureaucratic barriers are eliminated, since there are no ""laws"" or intermediaries, and wealth barriers are overcome. It does not matter if the individual is an accredited, new investor, with a lot or little capital. You can also invest and be part of this system.

**The tokenization of art has the potential to change investment and the purchase of art**

The average investor does not have much art in his portfolio. And the reason for that lack of investment is clear: people do not invest in art because the entry barriers are too high.

The vast majority of people do not have money to invest in works of art housed in well-known galleries or sold at auctions. They also do not have the time or the knowledge to detect emerging artists and evaluate which works to buy.

But the tokenization of art can change the dynamics of investment. In fact. It is now possible to convert, for example, a Kandinsky painting into a token, accessible and marketable throughout the world through secondary asset markets.

Through fiduciary money, such as euros or dollars and even [cryptocurrencies](https://tokendevelop.com/en/should-your-company-accept-payments-in-cryptocurrencies/), individuals can buy tokens, that is, a fraction of the work of art. Once they have one or more art tokens, they can maintain that investment, sell it or exchange it according to fluctuations in the value of the work of art.

If the work of art increases in its entirety, the holders of the token will receive the proportional part of it. And as art often increases in value over time, it has the potential to be a good investment.

But what is a token?

To understand the revolution that tokenization entails, it is necessary to understand that it is a token. It is a card, that is, a unit that replaces something else. Just as players in a casino receive chips depending on the amount they wish to play, so new investors based on blockchain technology will receive tokens from the investment they make.

A **token**, in English tab, as for example those used in recreational machines or in bumper cars, in reality, is nothing more than a new term for a unit of value, issued by a private entity. It is based on the blockchain network.

The idea is to convert an asset into smaller units of value to make it more accessible and affordable for the general public. For example, art platforms that tokenize art essentially provide fractional ownership of works of art.

**Investors are not the only ones who will benefit from the tokenization of art**

Tokenization has the potential to open up investments in the art world. However, investors are not the only ones who benefit.

On the one hand, it allows museums and other institutions to raise money without taking loans with high interest rates. Instead, they have the opportunity to sell tokens in one of the works they already own. With that money, they could expand their collection even further, without relying on expensive loans.

Artists could use the investments to finance their own work, sell tokens of works of art and potentially increase their value through word of mouth and commerce.

If finally, that piece or picture is sold for more value of the total investment, then the owners would be entitled to some of the returns, and the artist increases its reputation.

None of this will happen overnight but there are pioneering companies in this sector such as [Token Develop](https://tokendevelop.com/en/) that allow people to buy tokens of works of art. In this way, one day, before he believes it, he will be able to ""have"" that Kandinsky painting with which he has always dreamed.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Completely new to IRA, brokerage accounts, online banking, investing in general","Just started working in a lower COL area and after ballparking a quick budget I figure I should be able to save at least $2000 a month if I don't treat myself too much. My company doesn't do 401k for the first year, so that's out of the picture.

So I know emergency funds go first, with around 6 months living expenses.

Next put $5500 into a Roth IRA, but I'm way in over my head about where to do it. I've looked around the sub and people largely recommend Schwab, Vanguard, and Fidelity, but I'm still not completely sure what the difference is between them. Is it worth putting $1833 in each of them (for 5 years) and seeing which works best for me? Or is the difference really not worth the extra legwork? I know some charge more/less for trading, does this mostly just apply to people actively trading in the stock market?

Next is a taxable brokerage account (or maybe this should go first and I should take out $5500 for my IRA at the end?) Is there any reason to do this at a different place from my IRA?

Schwab checking allows you to use any ATM for free, and Fidelity has a 2% cash back credit card. Are there any other unique benefits I should know about for different companies in general?

Next I think I'd like to open a new bank account. I currently have my checking and savings with Wells Fargo but their interest rates are kind of sad. I know CIT bank has (had?) the highest savings interest rates, but other places like Ally, CapitalOne, Discover have high interest rates, plus a checking account. Is there anything wrong with keeping my checking with WF and opening a savings with CIT? Or are interest rates so volatile that they average to about the same?

Any other advice is appreciated too! For now I'm just looking to get started asap.

Edit: Decided not to go with CIT after hearing that they won't automatically raise your interest rates",finance

personalfinance,How to start saving/fixing credit to buy a house?,"Let me toss a few stats at you first:  I'm 38, make $35k a year, and have about 20k in credit card debt, 24k on a vehicle loan (that has four years left on it), and untold balances of student loans (probably about 100k).  I have a 45 mile commute (one way) to work, and I work five days a week.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wanting to move closer to my job, but I don't want to throw money away renting and the climate here (Ohio) isn't good enough to live in an RV or something, which was what I really wanted to do (alas, no year-round campgrounds in my area).  So I want to buy a house.   Nothing fancy, nothing huge, just a little place I can call my own.  My problem is that I don't know anything about buying a house or, really, finances in general.

As it stands, I can't really move for about two years (non-financial reason), so I figure while I'm waiting, I ought to do as much as I can to build my credit score (it's low 600s, according to CreditKarma), pay off existing debt, and make myself look as attractive as I can to potential mortgage lenders.

I just don't know what that entails.  Should I get a consolidation loan for my credit cards (all cards have an interest rate of 20%-30%)?  Should I focus on paying off the huge vehicle payment (8.75% interest, but the payment is $575 a month and the vehicle -- big van -- is a gas hog)?

One extra thing I have to consider is this:   I have two vehicles -- a two year old van that gets 16mpg, and an 11 year old Toyota that gets 40mpg.  I've been driving the Toyota to work obviously, but it's pushing 160k miles and I don't know how much longer it will last.  If it breaks down, I have no savings/money to fix it, and going back to driving the van to work (which is what I was doing before I got the Toyota) would drown me in gas.  I couldn't afford to drive that behemoth.  I've been considering saving up a little money (income tax return, extra from paychecks, etc.) and going out in February of next year to trade the big van in on a newer, smaller car.  It should lower the monthly payment, but it ties me up in another loan for five or six years, and I'm not sure how that would affect getting a home loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated.  I want to get started right away and not waste any time, but I have no idea what I'm doing.

&amp;#x200B;

ETA:  The Toyota is paid off.  Forgot to mention that.

I'm amazed at how some people get tons of help in forums like this one, and others get next to nothing.

**Edit 2:** After exposing u/goal1, he has removed the following text from his profile:  **""Follow me for investing advice or whatever""** A better edit would have been: **~~Follow me for investing advice or whatever~~**

u/Goal1 originally posted this text:

&gt;*I wanted to start off by saying I don’t feel that we have enough in depth conversation on this subreddit. Posts tend to be be, “What stocks should I buy” more than anything else. I thought I would add this to bring more in depth conversation and analysis to the table.*  
&gt;  
&gt;I recommend shorting the Russell 2000 through shorting a Russell 2000 ETF such as IWM. I will discuss the overall valuation metrics for the index, then touch on the index’s return on capital, margin structure and leverage levels. Then, i will discuss the impact of interest rates on valuation. At points, the write up below will make use of S&amp;P 500 data, since the S&amp;P 500 has better long-term data than the R2000.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Valuation**  
&gt;  
&gt;Analysts most often use P/E ratios to measure the R2000’s valuation. The Russell 2000 is often quoted as P/E excluding negative earnings for which it sports a 21x P/E ratio. If we are to include companies that lose money, the P/E increases to 62.7x. There’s no precise way to measure the index’s valuation given the issues that money losing companies (\~35% of the index by number and \~25% by market value) present.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bulls touting the 21x PE commit a sin of omission, while bears citing a 62.7x P/E capitalize negative earnings for companies that investors judge worth significant positive values. The following example shows the issue with a simple framework that takes index earnings / index market cap (62.7x). Let’s assume that the index is composed of 2,000 companies, each with a $1bn value.  
&gt;  
&gt;Further, let’s assume that 1,999 companies earn $100m and 1 company loses $100bn. The total index earnings would be $100bn for an index P/E of \~20x. However, if we assume that the money losing company has a value of $0, the index P/E would be \~10x. While I’m quick to point out the flaws with the two most common valuation methods, i do not have an obviously better solution. However, through looking at the valuation in a number of ways, I feel comfortable that i’m “approximately right rather than precisely wrong.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**P/E**  
&gt;  
&gt;The median P/E of companies that have positive net income = 21.8x.  
&gt;  
&gt;I set companies with PEs &gt;40 (high P/Es) and &lt;0 (money losing) to 40x. This produces a weighted average P/E for the index of 28.9x P/E. I think this is the most fair way to deal with the negative earnings issue.  
&gt;  
&gt;The index PE (total income / total market value) = 62.7x.  
&gt;  
&gt;**EV/EBIT**  
&gt;  
&gt;The EV/EBIT of the index equals 27.8x excluding financial firms.  
&gt;  
&gt;The EV/EBIT (excluding negative earnings) of the index is 20.9x excluding financial firms. Thus, I think the index trades at rich multiples of \~29x P/E and an EV/EBIT of &gt;20x. It’s important to note that we are in the 9th year of a bull-market and an economic expansion. These multiples capitalize late-cycle earnings.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Return on Capital and Margins**  
&gt;  
&gt;Stocks should trade at high multiples when margins are set to rise or the business can grow at returns on capital above the cost of capital. As an aside, the index short eliminates much of the individual security risk. Shorting a speculative biotech may end in disaster but shorting a diversified index of 2,000 companies eliminates the risk that you may misjudge the merits of an individual security. Moreover, it’s difficult to suspend the laws of economics for a large and diversified set of companies. One would expect a set of 2,000 companies to produce average return metrics. The median ROE of profitable companies is 9.7% and the weighted average ROE is 17.4%. Including money losing companies at a -5% ROE (average ROE of money losing companies is actually -85% ROE) reduces the weighted average ROE to 11.8%.  
&gt;  
&gt;The average return on invested capital (NOPAT / common equity plus long-term liabilities) for profitable companies equals 8.8%, with a median of 6.6%. A more generous definition of return on capital (NOPAT / PPE + CA - CL) for profitable companies produces an average and median return of 17.4% and 11.9%, respectively (I round down ROIs &gt;100% to 100% to avoid distorting the averages). Theses returns are based on 2017 earnings relative to 2016/2017 IC.  
&gt;  
&gt;These returns came during a strong economic year and are likely to be lower on a mid/through the cycle basis. Nevertheless, as stated earlier, the returns generated by the R2000 appear to be near or slightly above the cost of capital. This is not a portfolio of 2,000 Amazon’s and Netflix’s, but a diversified collection of average businesses. Even if you believe that we are in the early stages of an economic expansion, the multiples for the group as a whole do not make sense.  
&gt;  
&gt;With respect to margins, we can assume that the Russell 2000’s margins are correlated with the Fed’s corporate margin data. The Fed’s data set dates back to 1947 and shows a clear mean reverting trend. The average margin over this period is 6.9% compared to today at 9.5% (86.6% percentile).  
&gt;  
&gt;Our case does not rest on margins falling, but I think that the risk is clearly to the downside. Margins have averaged 9.8% over the past 10 years. This ranks in the 96.7% percentile for 10-year periods. If margins were to fall to historical averages, the Schiller P/E would rise from 32.8x to 48.5x.  
&gt;  
&gt;Moreover, we hear that margins should be higher today given the shift towards capital light companies in the index. However, to produce a similar return on capital, economic theory suggests that margins should be lower for capital light companies than for capital heavy ones.  
&gt;  
&gt;The R2000 does not have many world-beating firms that have high barriers to entry and that can grow quickly organically without significant capital investment. Anecdotally, private equity has taken out many of the higher quality, smaller companies, leaving the R2000 with a negative survivor bias. This is difficult to prove, but the pedestrian return on capital metrics show that the index does not deserve a stratospheric multiple  
&gt;  
&gt;**Leverage**  
&gt;  
&gt;These companies are quite levered. For non-financial companies only, the Net Debt to EBIT = 6.3x for the index, 4.7x excluding the losses of making companies, and 4.6x excluding the net debt and losses of loss making companies. Should earnings fall, margins compress or rates rise, the average company’s debt burden will increase from these already high levels.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Interest Rates**  
&gt;  
&gt;Bulls tend to cite low rates to justify current trading multiples.  
&gt;  
&gt;Schiller P/E During Similar Nominal Interest Rate Periods  
&gt;  
&gt;Interest rates have been below four percent in 54% of months since 1871. When interest rates have been under 4%, the Schiller P/E has averaged 16.7x. Excluding this bull market, the Schiller P/E averages drop to 15.7x. Today the Schiller PE equals 32.8x. The current 32.8x P/E ranks as the 99.8% percentile relative to the other 963 months where interest rates were under 4%.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Interest Rate Cycles**  
&gt;  
&gt;Historically, interest rates have moved in long cycles. There were bull markets in interest rates from 1873-1899, 1920-1946, and 1981-?, and there were bear markets in interest rates from 1899-1920 and 1946-1981. These market cycles have lasted between 21 and 35+ years. Interest rates have been rising since 2016, however, we do not know whether or not 2016 marked the end of the 35-year interest rate bull market starting in 1981. This is not being discussed for the purpose of declaring that the cycle is turning. I mention this as we believe long term historical context is important and is left out of most analyses.  
&gt;  
&gt;Global Markets If i am incorrect and current interest rates in the US justify valuations, then the logical assumption to us would be that even lower interest rates in other markets would justify even higher valuations in those markets. Below are some of the markets with the most extreme interest rates. We use StarCapital’s Stock Market Valuation data for CAPE’s for other markets [here it is](https://www.starcapital.de/en/research/stock-market-valuation/)  
&gt;  
&gt;CAPE 10 Year Bond Rate 30 Year Bond Rate 10 Year Inflation Protected Rate (Real Yield)  
&gt;  
&gt;United States 31.2x 2.88% 3.00% 0.79%  
&gt;  
&gt;Japan 27.2x 0.08% 0.81% -0.40%  
&gt;  
&gt;Germany 20.1x 0.25% 1.25% -1.27% (7.6 years) -1.00% (11.6 years)  
&gt;  
&gt;Switzerland 25.6x -0.19% 0.51% N/A  
&gt;  
&gt;While, the table above doesn’t necessarily say that the US is overvalued, there is a clear relative valuation discrepancy between the US and the other markets. In the other three markets shown, interest rates are significantly lower while valuations are less demanding.  
&gt;  
&gt;Compared to July 1, 2016 The Russell 2000 is up 46.3% from July 1, 2016 despite the fact that the 10 Year Treasury has gone from 1.47% to 2.88% and the 10 Year TIPs increased from 0.09% to 0.79%. While both rates and the index price in future expectations not current/trailing numbers, valuations have gone up while interest rate expectations have also moved up.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Real Interest Rates**  
&gt;  
&gt;Lastly, I found most of the analysis done using nominal interest rates to be unsatisfactory. While interest rates are nominal, history shows that earnings of businesses adjust over time to inflation. Therefore, comparing interest rates (nominal) with P/Es or earnings yields (real) is like comparing apples and oranges. Comparing a 10-year treasury yielding 2.9% today vs. 12.4% in December 1980 in the context of stock market valuation or the attractiveness of buying the 10-year treasury is misleading.  
&gt;  
&gt;Inflation in 1980 was 13.5% and inflation today is 2.1%. Assuming inflation stayed the same in both periods for the ensuing 10 years, the 2.9% treasury today would actually be the more attractive one in real returns. Its real pre-tax return would be better and real after-tax returns tax would be significantly better than the 1980 bond despite the lower nominal yield.  
&gt;  
&gt;Obviously using current inflation for the next 10 years is a stretch and ideally, we could compare TIPS rates which price in expected inflation, however TIPs were only introduced in 1997. I believe real yields (TIPS) relative to stock earnings yields is not perfect but a better comparison than comparing to nominal yields. Based on this assertion I’m not surprised to find essentially no correlation between nominal interest rates and stock market Schiller P/Es. I would expect a stronger correlation between TIPS rates and P/Es but unfortunately no such data exists. I believe this disproves any logic saying that 3% nominal interest rates justify the current valuations.

personalfinance,We make middle class incomes yet are drowning in debt…help,"Hi, my husband and I could use some serious financial advice. We make middle class incomes in the US yet are drowning in debt and struggle to see a way to get out. We had gotten a hold of it by doing a consolidation loan in early 2015, but then Started charging things on different credit cards and got into trouble using them to pay medical bills in 2016 when my husband and I both got sick at the same time and had a month with zero income, and then I had an additional 3 months of no income in 2017 when I was sick.

&amp;#x200B;

During that time my husband and I stupidly didn’t make payments for several months on a credit card that was in my name only, and it sunk my credit. So we do not qualify for a new consolidation loan because I’m the breadwinner yet my credit isn’t good (602). My husband’s credit is great (720) but his income isn’t, so banks won’t even consider us - Leaving me out, they see the debt to income ratio as too high for them to give us a loan. We tried to dig out of debt by doing a $12,000 0% balance transfer from Wells Fargo CC to PNC CC in January 2018, but we were stupid and didn’t cut up the credit card after we did that, so we ran it back up to the max and that expires in January 2019 before we get killed with the interest. We FINALLY cut up all of our cards a few months ago, which is great - no more charging - but we can barely make it. A huge part of the problem is that we spend about $30 a day on carry out meals and ubers because we work stressful jobs and we are too tired to cook anything and too exhausted to get out of bed early enough to use public transit in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

To add another layer to this, I found out that I am pregnant (yay) and will only get paid 2/3 of my income next June-August 2019 when I go out on maternity leave (not yay), and I really think that we are not going to be able to survive financially when that time comes because we live paycheck to paycheck now. Then there’s daycare costs after that!

&amp;#x200B;

There are two possibilities that we have considered:

1. One is to break our lease (which ends June 30, 2019) and move home with mom until we get this debt knocked out. We’d agree to help with some bills, but would reduce our rent to zero (money that we could then turn around to use for child care). With our rent being zero, maybe we could then qualify for a consolidation loan again with Wells Fargo. Our car insurance would drop in half as we’d be moving from a city to a rural county. We would end up spending way more in gas, though – more like $400 a month. Also she would be able to help cook, which would be a godsend for us. She is not able to provide childcare because she still works. This is a huge change for us, though, and somewhat embarrassing to move home…
2. Two is that my mom mentioned to us that since she offered my brother a $20,000 loan that they used towards a down payment, she could do a $20,000 loan for us. We have considered that we would use $13,000 of the $20,000 to pay off the PNC card before we end up getting stuck paying the interest from the balance transfer if we don’t pay it off by January 2019. We would also pay off the $5,167.38 consolidation loan so that we can snowball that $459 monthly into knocking out other cards. The remainder of the $20,000 would go to overdue and long needed maintenance work for our cars (one of which isn't currently running and the other is barely running). I’m not so sure how to set this up, though – my thought was that we’d agree to do an automatic money transfer from our credit union account to hers every month for the loan and that we would agree to pay interest on the loan. The fact that she’s able to do something like this at all shows how much privilege I have and I am so thankful.

**So what I’d like to know are your thoughts. What would you do in my position?**

One week in December last year I got $500 in tips. Some months are slower than others but I have been saving $100 a week and using whatever’s left for groceries, food and gas. All together I make $25K to $30K a year. 

December - Feb it’ll slow down a lot. (I work at a golf course), it’ll get cold and we will have less events. I’ll still work regular hours but tips will slow down minus Christmas week. 

I am turning 25 in January and I will actively look for a better job but in the mean time how much more can I earn with ALLY?

They are at 1.90% right? Should I leave maybe $30,000 with compass and $20,000 into ALLY? Are there any fees with ALLY?

Do you have to actively put money into ALLY or can I just throw $20K into it and let it build over time?",finance

&amp;#x200B;

Ok Reddit here goes. I am in trouble. I am not smart enough at this to understand what is my best option here. I will list all the details that I know may be needed or asked about. If you need any more please ask. Everyone on here is better at this than I am, and the person I am using to refinance my house seems friendly/smart but you never know if they are out for your best interest or their nice payday.

&amp;#x200B;

I know we have been stupid. I also know we could sale our home right now and pay everything off and start over. We would walk away with probably $40K after paying everything off. We really do not want to sale the home for many reasons. So if you will please consider this in your replies. We would if we had to, but at this moment, we do not want that on the table. I could give you reasons/excuses for why we are in the shape we are but none of it matters as of today. It is what is it and now we need to fix it. Changes have been made a few months ago, but we are not making much headway with it so we started looking at other options.

&amp;#x200B;

Details are as follows. Wife and I bring home around $4750 per month. Bank Accounts: $2000. Savings Account: $3500. Both vehicles are paid off. Total worth maybe $15K

&amp;#x200B;

Mortgage (with Insurance/Taxes) is $1100 per month with 162K left on it at 4.0%.

&amp;#x200B;

Cell (3 Lines): $120

&amp;#x200B;

DSL, Home Line, Security: $120

&amp;#x200B;

Light Bill/Gas: $350 average

&amp;#x200B;

TV/Streaming: $120

&amp;#x200B;

Gas/Vehicle Expenses: $320

&amp;#x200B;

Vehicle Insurance: $125

&amp;#x200B;

Wife has Life Insurance on parents: $131

&amp;#x200B;

Storage Unit: $130 (This is going in next 30 days)

&amp;#x200B;

Bank Loan: $184 ($9000 balance 3.5%)

&amp;#x200B;

Credit Cards Total: $1815 (Mostly 21% Interest) 11 cards total. Two cards carry $40,000 and the rest is about $30,000. So $70,000 total. I looked it up. Of that 1815 I think like $950 or so goes to interest)

&amp;#x200B;

Food/House Goods: $300.

&amp;#x200B;

**Total $4815.**

&amp;#x200B;

So as you can see. No wiggle room. We are going to cut the cord and save $100 per month. The storage unit will give us $130 extra.  That is $230 more to pay towards credit cards. My wife can work a lot of overtime and maybe bring home another $1000 a month. This is her working 10-12 hour days 6 days a week. I also can pick up a Saturday job that pays $100 per week. No overtime at my job.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the option we were gave from a mortgage place was as follows. They would loan us the money to pay off all the credit card bills. The loan would be total of about $1950 (Mortgage $1500, Insurance/Tax $288, Extra Insurance $175). It would raise our interest rate to 5.5%. In addition, he said something about extra insurance. The loan he was 80% of our house worth so it required a different type of loan. It is about $175 a month more, but once we paid off some of the loan and got our credit scores up, we could refinance again and get it removed in maybe a year. Plus get lower interest rate. Maybe back to the 4% it is at now. Just scary to have such a large jump in payment on house even though It is taking so much off of us in stupid credit cards.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My question is what you would do. Be honest, be mean, reply however you need to reply. I deserve it for my poor, poor management of money. I will cringe clicking this if I get replies to it. However, after you are done telling me how stupid I am, if you have any advice on what my best plan would be truly appreciate the words. I keep thinking I have left out important information. I have never posted here before, and even being a member of Reddit for 5 years now, I have never made a post this long. So I am going to post it and I may need to edit it to space it out more. So if this is brand spanking new give a moment or two to edit it to make it easier to read. Thanks for all help and advice.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** 

Most of the replies have been asking about how we got into this much debt. Asking why. I did not post it because I wanted everyone's true thoughts. The truth is this. Back in 2015 we probably had 15K in debt on cards. We had just got married, had a really nice wedding and vacation. Life was grand. Then two months after getting married our daughter committed suicide. My wife did not work for 4 months. We got more behind but not a lot. I worked as much as possible to keep bills paid. Then for the next 2 years almost we used money as a way to try to buy happiness. I guess it was like a drug. Even though you're only going to have happiness for that split second of spending the money, it still for a moment takes the pain away and allows you to maybe forget about what happened. Neither of us talked to anyone professional. We started to, but people kept telling us unless they had went through it no one could help us. So we just drifted. Wife was put on medication. I tried fighting it off with just trying to pretend it never happened and that she was just moved away. We took some vacations we couldn't afford. We bought tons of stuff we couldn't afford. I don't like talking about it to this day because now the rest of the day will be nothing but thinking about her and how we failed her in a lot of ways. We aren't fixed 100% emotionally, but when it comes to money we basically quit cold turkey 3 months ago on using cards at all. We realized it was not going to fix anything. We are just now trying to see how to fix this. I've rambled on enough. Thanks for any advice.",finance

personalfinance,$200k+ in student loan debt - Public Service Job vs. Private Sector Job,"Currently, I have $220,000 in student loan debt (6.3% interest rate) from law school that I consolidated. I work for a government agency making $80,000/year with a bonus of approximately $15,000. I am paying off my student loan with Income Based Repayment Plan ($350/month) and hoping I can take advantage of Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I am three years in and have made the consecutive payments. If I stay, I need to stay for 7 years to apply for PSLF. 

I am 31, married, and my wife has $0 debt. Wife makes $86,000.  We live on Long Island. Expenses per month:

$2,300 for rent
$500 for groceries
$400 car payment
$250 cable/electric

I also want to mention Wife will be able to retire at 55 with a pension. And I put 9% of my salary into a 401k and my employer matches 6%. 

Ok, now the option. I have been offered a position that pays $130,000/year and approximately $20,000 bonus. They will pay me that bonus now as a “sign on” to leave my current job. If I leave, I can no longer take advantage of public service loan forgiveness. Staying in my current position could see a 15% increase in 1.5 years. 

My wife and I want to buy a house soon. We have $70,000 saved already. I know we probably could use that money to get my loan down but we want to start a family. We don’t want to rent anymore and we’re afraid if we use that money to pay the loans we will never save the money for a house. 

The short of it. What do I do? Is it too much of a risk to leave the government job and give up on loan forgiveness? Is it even with it?",finance

2015:

* My then girlfriend was in medical school. Over $50,000 student loan at about 8% interest rate. Her dad at that time thought that its better to take a HELOC loan on her house which was 4% and pay off her student loan with high interest. So now she didnt have a student loan and her father has $50000 HELOC which they were paying monthly at 4% interest

2017: 

* We got married. I own a house (since before we got married) and pay monthly mortgage on that house. Now we are paying monthly amount to her father which goes towards the remaining loan. However I don't get any benefits of paying off that loan since we are just transferring money to her dad directly.

**My Questions:**

* Is there any way to transfer this loan under our name with similar interest?
* We looked up personal loans but the interest on personal loans is very high (over 12%)
* Since my house is under my name only, can we take a HELOC on my house to pay off her loan? If so, I assume this HELOC loan will be 100% in my name and not on wife's name, is that correct?",finance

personalfinance,"[X-post from r/PersonalFinanceCanada] Need some advice on what to do with some inherited money, ft. cross-border complications","Hey all,

I need some advice on what to do with a monetary value of about 65k USD (including capital gains, which amount to about 11k). It's currently a part of my parent's investment portfolio managed by a US-based investment fund, and essentially functions as a fraction of it. I currently live in Canada with my parents being in the USA. It is under my parents name with the understanding/expectation (wills, etc.) that it would be given to me at some point in my adult life. I am a dual-citizen of the countries involved. 

I'm aware of two options:

1. I ask for the money and cash out, due to the investment company not managing money for someone with no residency in the USA. Subsequently, I'm not sure how best acquire the money from my parents without a serious chunk being taken out for taxes, nor what to do with it once I have it. From what I understand, I would be able to receive half this calendar year and half next year without taxes applying (because gift tax? or something else of which I'm not sure of the name). I'd like to leverage it, but don't know what would be best. As well, it looks like (because of my residency status) I would have to invest it myself, or with a Canadian investment firm in CSD (which would necessitate conversion).
2. I do not ask for the money, which might necessitate it merging with my parent's portfolio in order to comply with the firm's investment client rules. While I would prefer this option financially, as the firm has done very well through the life of the portfolio (which includes the financial collapse of 2008) and is positioned well medium and long-term, I dislike having it merge with my parent's portfolio, as things have been contentious between us in the past. The residency issue might cause the merging of the portfolio, and I would prefer the money not be there against federal/corporate-specific laws/rules.

Keeping the money as it is currently doesn't work, as besides the aforementioned residency issue the firm doesn't manage (relatively) small amounts like mine - it's not worth their time. It was done as a favor, as well as because the investment account has grandfather rights.

personalfinance,Personal Savings vs. IRA,"Hi all - obviously I know that specific questions should be directed toward a financial advisor, but I wanted to see what the thoughts here were on a savings account vs. IRA.
For some background, I'm a clinician at a small medical clinic that does not offer any IRA or 401k plans, so if I want to start one of these up, it's on me to go through my personal bank (though I'm planning on leaving this position within 9-12 months, hopefully to an employer with IRA/401k plans). I use Ally Bank (which I LOVE), which offers a 1.85% interest rate on both my personal savings account and Roth IRA Savings account (I'm choosing Roth over Traditional because of my age). After discussing some of the conditions with someone on the customer service line, I'm under the impression that the only difference between the two accounts is that with a Roth IRA I have to pay a 10% fee to move the funds (which, in theory, I may want to do if I switch employers), whereas I don't with my personal savings account.
My roommate told me that there are tax benefits for putting money in an IRA, and my boss told me that additional money is accrued due to the banks using the money in my IRA for investments, but I've tried doing research and really can't figure out whether or not either of these things are true.
So - given that the interest accrual rate is the same for my personal savings and Roth IRA savings account, and that I may want to transfer funds in 9-12 months (assuming I find a job that offers IRA/401k programs), is it worth it to open the Roth IRA, or should I just stick with my personal savings? Thoughts??

tldr; not sure if it's worth it to open an IRA right now or just stick with my personal savings",finance

personalfinance,Saving vs paying debt,"Hey guys.. I have fairly good credit - 700. I have a car loan with $850 left and a personal loan from credit card debt at $4k. 

Monthly payments are $170 and I plan to make a payment of $800 on the personal loan next month so I get get it into more manageable territory. Anyway, after that comes. I have the option of paying the minimums on the loans and contributing another $400 to my savings (totaling $800 per month going into my savings). My savings is already at $4k and gets a 1.9% interest rate.

The other option is to pay $800 a month until around March and at that time both loans will be paid off. This while still contributing $400 to my savings. I also have a student loan totaling $27K but I'm not too worried about that because I pay around $200 a month for it and it's a longer term loan. 

Any advice would be great. I would like to book up my savings just didn't know if it would be smarter to save more now and make minimums or not. Honestly, since I have enough saved to cover most of the immediate debt o have (not student loans) I am much more comfortable with my situation.",finance

I filed my taxes in 2015 and I owed money on both my Federal and State taxes. (I don't remember how much at all.. I want to say around $2,500 each?)

I setup a payment plan with both California and the IRS and I've been making payments ever since. I've never missed a payment or been late on a payment.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to file my taxes for 2016, but I again owed on both my Federal and State taxes. (Just under $1,200 for Federal and just under $1,000 for California).

I did not have the money to pay either. I did some looking around online and saw somewhere that you could not setup another payment plan... so I just didn't file them.

I know, this was a very stupid decision, and I now know that the ""setting up another payment plan"" isn't entirely true.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017, I again owed on both my Federal and State taxes (just under $2,500 for Federal and just under $1,400 for California).. and again, I did not have this money so I did not file.

&amp;#x200B;

In total, I owe a little bit over $6,000 to both California and the IRS. I have all of my taxes prepared and filled out for both 2016 &amp; 2017, State and Federal. They're currently sitting in envelopes waiting to figure out what to do next. I don't have the lump sum to pay all of this, but I can pay it on a payment plan.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I proceed? Do I mail in the 2016 and 2017 returns to the IRS and to California and wait to get a letter in the mail for payment and then call and ask to have it all added into my current payment plan? Or is there something else I need to do? I'm terribly confused...",finance

btc,"Some facts and opinions about CTOR: Not much to win, but everything to loose","This is a writeup of facts and statements about Canonical Transaction Ordering as planned by ABC for the November hardfork. I am no technical expert, but able to understand a lot of things of Blockchain. I am a member of Bitcoin Unlimited and a not-unknown Bitcoin writer in Germany. I oppose CTOR. This said, I tried my best to present an unbiased and rational view of the arguments for and against. If I miss / misunderstand something, just tell me, I will correct my post.

**THE GOOD**

* Transaction Ordering in a Block was identified as an area in block construction which could be imporoved to help longterm scalability some time ago.
* One year ago several Bitcoin Cash developers from different teams met and decided that this topic should be pushed forward during the subsequent upgrade forks.
* CTOR was the product of the cooperation of different teams, not just from ABC
* CTOR is said to improve parallelisation and sharding. 
* CTOR is proven to improve graphene block-reduction from ~98% to 99.6%
* If scaling software is developed, it is good to do this with CTOR as soon and universally as possible. That's why doing it with a hard fork now has advantages.
* CTOR is supported by many technical experts, including the ABC developers, but also Chris Pacia (Open Bazaar) and others.
* Bitcoin ABC provided the code for CTOR in the agreed time (August 15th) which should leave enough time for everybody else to test and implement it for the November fork

**THE NOT-SO-GOOD**

* It is not exactly clear how CTOR improves longterm-scalability. Some developers like Andrew Stone or Tom Zander doubt it does significantly.
* The only proven improvement is Graphene. Graphene is a method to massively reduce traffic in block propagation. Currently it enables to save 98%, CTOR can increase this rate to 99.6%. However, developers like Andrew Stone think similar improvements can be achieved without hardforking to CTOR. 
* None of CTOR's improvements which are supposed or proofed are needed or even helpful in the near or midterm future. With a current blocksize of 0.1-0.2mb Bitcoin Cash can grow for a long time without having any benefit from CTOR.
* CTOR requires not just an hardfork, but developers of several software projects to update or change their code. 

**THE BAD**

* CTOR is said to break existing software beyond the scope of how an easy hard fork like a blocksize-increase does. It requires more code to fix than a simple upgrade.
* CTOR is criticized for not only not helping Bitcoin Cash scaling, but to harm it. 
* CTOR is opposed by significant parts of Bitcoin Cash ecosystem:
*  Andrew Stone (BU developer) is highly sceptical of it. BU members voted against CTOR with 24:5. This is one of the most clearest rejections a BUIP ever got.
* Tom Zander (Flowee) says it breaks his implementation, harms parallelization and UTXO-database management
* nChain and CoinGeek oppose it. You don't need to believe in our Faketoshi (I don't) to acknowledge that he and CoinGeek participate in the ecosystem by investments, media, communities, evangelization and, last but not least, by providing a significant part of the hashrate. Like it or not, but they have enough stake in the game to be considered an important voice. With their hashrate they are able to split Bitcoin Cash.
* maybe somehow affiliated / befriended with nChain and usually likeminded are: Kyuupichan (developer of ElectrumX), David Jerry (SBI) and Ryan X. Charles (Yours, MoneyButton). Their affiliation with nChain does in no way diminish what they do for Bitcoin Cash. They appear to oppose CTOR.
* NxtChain, provider of a few services for Bitcoin Cash, announced that he will stop supporting Bitcoin Cash if CTOR is activated.
* there might be more, but I stopped here.

**CONCLUSION**

In my opinion CTOR is not a stupid, maybe even a very clever and good change, but currently in no way needed. It adds nothing to deal with the challenges Bitcoin Cash currently faces. Technically it might even do slightly more harm than good by binding developer's time. 

The significant oposition of the ecosystem makes it highly controversal and a social desaster. The activation against this oposition could result in a permanent chain-split, dismotivation of a lot of valueable members of the community(1), disadoption by services and provide food for anti-BCH-marketing like ""centralized Bitmaincash shitcoin"". It will weaken what Bitcoin Cash currently needs most: The spirit of the community.

It is possible that a CTOR fork kills a still infant and vulnerable ecosystem like Bitcoin Cash. There is not much to win, but everything to loose.

(1) I include myself in this list. I think I am the most prominent, visible and respected Pro-BCH part of the German Bitcoin-media-landscape. Eventually you can also include Norway, who founded the Oslo Bitcoin meetup and is by far Norway's most visible and prominent Bitcoin Cash supporter.",cryptocurrency

I am also wondering what would happen if I start investing in the US.,"Some personal information (if more exact details are necessary I can provide them):

I moved to where 1-2 parent is from as a child and I've been living abroad since then. I have local citizenship. I have not been to the US in years. I'm 25-35 and have been working between 3-10 years. I pay my local taxes and I'm not married. I have $XXk in the bank, I make $XXk a year, no real estate, no debt, no investments and a car that's worth less than I have in the bank. I'll likely change jobs soon and move to another country (not the US). I do not want to give up my US citizenship, I'd say there is a 10-30% chance I'd want to move back sometime in the future.

I recently got a call from my bank that I need to fill out a w9 form. This is my first contact with anything US tax related. Would this mean I'd have to start filling US taxes? Would I have to pay anything? What does it mean for me in the future?

I did do a bit of googling, but I still trying to put it all together. I've found FEIE (Foreign Earned Income Exclusion) which supposedly means I wouldn't have to pay federal income tax. Would I have to pay other taxes? I would need to fill out FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Report), and I'm not sure what that means for me. I'm sure there is other stuff I need to know.

personalfinance,Cashing out a Whole Life Insurance Policy,"Hello all: 

&amp;#x200B;

I inherited a whole life insurance policy in my name when my grandfather passed 5 years ago. The policy is $50,000, with a monthly premium of $18.82. I started pulling from the cash value to pay for the premium (premium reduction-modal) last year or so, and now have a monthly payment of $12.83. The policy was created 19 years ago, and the current cash value is $5,600, dividend is $71.88 and next estimated dividend is $66.13. Paid up additions are at $6,600. 

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have term-life coverage for $175,000 through work that I pay $6/month for and have the option of keeping the coverage if I ever leave my position. My work also offers a free life insurance policy for $40k, which is my annual salary. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not the bread winner in my family and we have no children (yet). We live on my husband's salary which is 4x more than what I make. **Other than my student loans, we have no debt at all.** Currently, we only use my salary to pay off my student loans and after that, I'm going to start power housing my federal contribution limits. The rest of the money I make will go towards additional savings or funsies. If we have a kid (don't want more than 1), I would probably just be stay at home for a few years and go back to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

My loan balance was $46,000 last October (scattered across 12 loans, 12 months ago). Today, I have \~$14,000 left in student loans: 

1) Unsub loan generating a lot of interest per month at 5.41% at $4999 

2) Direct sub loan 5.6%: $4,999

3) Direct sub loan 3.2%: $2700 

4) Direct sub loan 3.2%: $900

&amp;#x200B;

Loan one generates about $80 a month towards the principal. The other three don't do that for some reason. I just want to cash out my cash value and apply it directly to the loan. My husband and I want to buy a house next spring, and I would really love having all my student loans paid off before then but now that I am almost under 10k for my loans, I would like to halve the amount I pay towards student loans and contribute the other half towards our down payment. In this vein, I believe I can have nearly all my loans eliminated before we apply for our mortgage. 

&amp;#x200B;

We could have $0 in debt when we apply and both have credit scores above 800. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I tried to call the company, the insurance lady gave me a hard time about eliminating this loan:

""We don't even offer this type of loan anymore with dividends."" 

""If you want a 50,000 whole life, it'd cost you $50/month now."" 

""Whole life is great, it won't cancel after 20 years!!""

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I are on target to have over 2 million net worth within 20 years. Logically, I know I won't and don't need this insurance. I also know that I could just put $18/month into my 3% checkings account and accrue more than $60/year in interest. However, my grandpa telling me to save this policy at all costs keeps ringing in my ears (damn guilt!). I would love some objective perspective to my situation! 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance. Let me know if you need anything else clarified further.

personalfinance,"Refinancing Student Loans, what is now the top priority for payments?","So I have been looking at refinancing my student loans, I have about 35K in total with an average interest rate at 5.52%. My 3 largest loans equate to 18K at 6.55%. Most of the rest are at 4.5%


There is a local bank that allows me to refinance for zero fees to a 3.5% variable (Capped at 1% raise yearly) or a 5.2% fixed. I have friends who refinanced through this company before and said the raise is usually less than 1%, but the fed has been raising rates this year so who knows.

I'm considering refinancing my 18K loans at 6.55% to the 3.5% variable rate, considering I could pay it off in 2 years or less.


My question is, should I continue to throw money at the 18K loans if they refinance to 3.5% or start paying off my 4.5% loans since they are now the highest interest rate? I'm expecting 5 years to pay off all loans with my current payment structure assuming (Doesn't include raises or bonuses).

&amp;#x200B;

**Location: Texas**

&amp;#x200B;

Background to mitigate ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT HOW"" questions: I went to an expensive (albeit prestigious) private university, graduated 2017. Parents took out Parent PLUS loans every year to cover what little financial aid we got didn't after the first year. I didn't know they didn't have the money to back up the loans, saved nothing for my education, and that they were essentially borrowing on my behalf just so I could make it through and I'd be responsible for the entirety of it after graduation. Yes, we never had this conversation, I genuinely didn't know. I'm not going to be whiny and complain about how my parents aren't paying because I'm not an entitled brat. **Amount has ballooned to $190k today in Parent PLUS loans with Great Lakes at about 6.5%.** Six figure debt on an undergrad degree is absolutely abhorrent. My mind is blown as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently at a cheap, local grad school because my company thankfully gives 10k a calendar year towards tuition reimbursement and I wanted to take advantage of it as the job security clock ticks. I've thrown some money at my **individual federal loans with MyFedLoans, about $27k total at on average 5%** and have full intent of paying it off. Intend to hustle and leverage my masters in IT and Management for a significant pay raise into the six figures but of course can't plan based on that non-guarantee.

&amp;#x200B;

**I do have a mortgage in my name alone.** I purchased my first home a few months ago - 0% down conventional, a decent interest rate in the midst of rising rates and a hot market. We walked away with money in our pocket and an extremely good deal on our home (291k loan, appraised for 325k, great location, great shape). I'm grateful for my parents holding that kind of debt in the interim for me since lenders would never in a million years lend to me with that kind of debt, delaying any ability to get a house for *years.*

&amp;#x200B;

**I take home about $4k a month, my fiancé takes home about $3400 a month, PITI is $2400 a month, no consumer debt of serious concern** (generally all 0% APR for a year or more new home stuff not totaling more than $5k). **An additional $3500/month on student loan payments alone for 15+ years is just not realistic for us**. I don't want to piss away money for that long. I would love to have a better psychological state and children one day.

&amp;#x200B;

**Intended strategy:** I do plan on taking this burden off my parents and refinancing into my name, which means going private. Texas SoL is 4 years starting when it goes into delinquency, if I read correctly. I'm not sure how strong of a candidate I am for a refinance since I have a $290k mortgage + $27k in loans balanced against an $83k salary, and would likely refuse to get a cosigner for this. I also can't predict, assuming I can take on the loan myself, whether or not they would sue instead of just sending me to collections and perhaps selling my debt to the collections agency later on. I'm not 100% sure of what possible timelines exist for that once I become past due. I've read they can't wage garnish me.

If I could settle for even 50% that would help, although I've read plenty stories of settling for less. I'm aware the remainder would be taxed as income. I can't find any information on if the settlement amount would accrue interest.

I'm aware this will tank my credit, but relying on my fiancé's for anything we need seems to make the most sense, especially since we don't plan on borrowing anything else anytime soon and it will rebound in my early 30s. We own our cars cash and will drive them into the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

**What am I missing here? Is there a better strategy for negotiating down my debt and planning for future goals concurrently, and what could I expect to happen once my account becomes delinquent that would make this a bad decision?**

personalfinance,Planning on buying a house next summer. How should I allocate my funds to protect my down payment but not be overly conservative?,"First off, yes I know interest rates are rising and all else held equal, I would buy the house now.  But I have some significant retirement benefits at my current job that are vesting next summer.  After that point my wife and I will be moving from Southern California to Northern California where homes are more affordable and we can be near family.

Right now I'm trying to figure out how to balance being conservative with the money we've saved up for a down payment versus staying invested in the stock market.  Just curious on your guys' thoughts on how I should balance that, knowing I'll be buying a house in about a year.

**Here are some details:** 

- I'm anticipating using $60k - $80k for a down payment. 
- A 6 month emergency fund for my wife and I is roughly $18k.

**My funds are currently spread like this:** 

- $43k in cash.  Most of it is in a high yield savings account with 1.8% interest. 
- $50k in the stock market in index funds. 
- I've got retirement funds as well, but obviously I'm not going to touch those, so that won't come into play. 
- I anticipate we'll save an average of $2k per month (conservative estimate), so we should have an additional $20k - $24k depending on when we buy the house next year.

personalfinance,Help negotiating car loan,"r/PF, I'm a first time car buyer purchasing a new Honda. I have a great credit score, but less 7 years of credit history with no loans except for credit card debt. Honda has a special promotion going on to offer car loans at 0.9% interest rate for 36 months or 1.9% for 60 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

My loan application requested the 0.9% interest rate for 36 months. My loan amount will be $34,000. This would put my monthly payment in the range of 25% of post-tax income. But Honda denied my request and said if I put down 3k, they can give me 1.9% interest rate for 60 months instead. Is this negotiable? Can I ask for 0.9% rate for 36 months (maybe if I put down 5k instead)? Or is this one of those situations, where I should take what I can get or I can walk away?  I have never done this before, so I would appreciate any feedback. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"What to do with Wedding Money? Pay off debt, save, invest, or a mixture?","Hello PF, been following and learning a ton and have a question above a big upcoming financial change. 

Little about me: 

* 26 years old.
* Recent law school grad with attorney job, currently making about 65k, will increase to 100k as soon as I am sworn in. 
* Have about 75k in loans and 4k in credit card debt that I racked up while not working and studying for the bar. 
   * Rates range anywhere from 3 to 6.8 percent depending on loan. Larger law school loans have higher percentage.
* My savings of about 20k has been completely drained in the last two years due to wedding ring and payments and other costs. 
* Fiance is a nurse making about 65k with about 5k in savings. No loans or debt. Has a 401k that she contributes the max towards each month. Has a car with a 550 dollar lease payment each month.
* Live in the Chicago and have about 2500 dollars in monthly expenses for rent, parking and utilities. 
   * Currently renting but considering  buying in the next couple years. 
* Working on being better with budgeting using YNAB with current plan to pay off all credit card debt and not letting it build up again. (Paying off entirety every month.) 
* Getting married in November, big wedding, majority paid by parents and in laws. 

**Assuming that we get anywhere form 20k to 30k, I'm unsure what are my best options for what to do with the money.** While I will obviously discuss everything with my fiance, I know she trust me to make the best decision I can and will be agreeable to a good plan. 

We plan on combining our finances and I know that I need to replenish our saving. I'd like to make it about 10k before doing anything else. (Plan on opening a high yield online savings together.)  

My plan for loan repayment is to auto pay the minimum every month aggregated to all the loans, and then to put in about 1000 extra every month towards the largest and highest interest loan each month. (Avalanche method.) 

However, I'm unsure of what to do with the left over wedding money. I've been toying with the idea of putting it all towards my high interest loans and getting a head start at paying them down. I can't really see any negatives with it as the faster I get the totals down the less interest I'll be throwing away and the quicker I'm down with them the quicker I can start saving and investing the money that would be going toward loan repayment. 

Am I missing something? Are there any negatives to putting the wedding gift money (after replenishing saving) towards my loans right away? Should we invest instead? (I know that once the larger interest rate loans are paid off investing may be more beneficial than just paying them down but at this point feel as though getting the larger high interest ones done with would be better.)  We've talked about possibly buying in about two years so the only reason I would need to keep the money all saved would be to help with the down payment. 

 Are there better options for me to do? Overall I'd love some suggestions and advice on how to best get started with my family's personal finances. 

Thanks!

* Inheriting ~$50,000.
* Job security for my field is extremely high (though that's 4-5 years from now).

I'm not especially knowledgeable about this stuff. I've tried to be wise about spending, though it is difficult when cost of living greatly exceeds my graduate stipend, so I have way more debt than I'd really hoped for.

personalfinance,1099 Employee - should I create a legal entity for tax benefits?,"Late last year I started doing some bookkeeping on the side for a small doctor’s office. I’m basically just serving the AP and treasury functions but because the office was/is so short staffed, I could set my own pay. I’m making $31k a year doing this. I’m an independent contractor and receive this money as 1099-MISC income on their regular employees’ payday. 

I have another full time, regular exempt employee job making roughly $90k, and have been paying an additional $400 per pay period in taxes out of my day job’s paycheck to cover the taxes from my side job without having to fool with estimated quarterly tax payments. I’m single so my regular tax bracket is 24%, but I end up paying somewhere around 40% in taxes on the side job income. 

Today I got to thinking - would it be advantageous for me to set myself up as an LLC (or another legal entity) to pay less in taxes? My deductions are minimal since I only really need a pen and paper and they gave me a laptop. I live in a one bedroom apartment so I didn’t think I could deduct any of my rent last year since I work from my dining room and it’s not a “dedicated office” (but please correct me if I’m wrong). My only deduction is mileage driving too and from their office a couple times a week since I work from home. 

If I should form some type of legal entity, what would be my best route to go about doing this and is it too late to do this for 2018, or if I set it up by the end of the year would it retrospectively apply to all income earned during 2018?

Tl,dr: I am a full time employee making $90k in TN and have a side job making $31k. Should I remain a 1099-MISC independent contractor or form some type of legal entity for tax benefits?

MachineLearning,[D] My cognitive model for model free RL agents,"I've been trying to come up with a working model for how biological intelligence works and using that to develop my own AI model. I've been working on this off and on for months, inspired by reinforcement learning. Here's what I've got:

**PropertySet:**

The mind does not use or work with objects, but with the set of properties for those objects. It's critical to make this distinction for the sake of pattern matching.

**Memory:**

Memory is transient, stateful information which is used to choose a most optimal behavior. All memory comes with expiration times. When an expiration time is up, the memory is lost and forgotten. The importance of a memory determines how long it persists in memory, and its importance is driven by relevance to internal motivations and number of recalls. The constant trimming of memory state is what prevents cognitive overload in the mind.

**Sensory Input:**

Sensory input is how an agent gets stateful information about the environment around itself. Sensory input information is fed directly into transient memory. There is no filter applied at the sensory input level. Sensor inputs get fed sets of properties created by external objects in the surrounding environment.

**Behavior:**

Behavior is a type of response or interaction an agent can have with itself or the external world around it. Behavior choice is the only tangible evidence we have of an agents internal intelligence, so choosing the correct and wrong behaviors will determine whether the agent passes an intelligence test.

**Motivator:**

Every character has internal needs it is trying to satisfy through the use of behaviors. Motivators are what drive behavior choice in the agents given environmental context. Motivators are defined by a name, a normalized value, and a set of behaviors which have been discovered to change the motivation value one way or another.

**Reward:**

Reward (emergent) is the summed result of all motivations when a behavior effect has been applied to an object. The amount of reward gained is exponentially proportionate to the motivation satisfaction, using an F(X,W) = W(10X\\\^3); equation, where X is normalized and represents motivational need, and W represents a weight. If you are manually assigning reward values to actions or properties, you're doing it wrong.

**Knowledge:**

Knowledge is a collection of abstract ideas and concepts which are used to identify relationships and associations between things. The abstractions can be applied towards related objects to make predictive outcomes, even though there is no prior history of experience. Knowledge is stored as a combination of property sets, behaviors, motivators, and reward experiences. Knowledge is transferable between agents.

\*\*\*Knowledge reflection:\*\*\* This is an internal process where we look at our collection of assembled knowledge sets and try to infer generalizations, remove redundancies, streamline connections, and make a better organized sense of things. In humans, this crystalization phase typically happens during sleep or through intentional reflection.

**Mind:**

The mind is the central repository for storing memory, knowledge, motivators, and behavior sets, and chooses behaviors based on these four areas of cognition. This is also where it does behavior planning/prediction via a dynamically generated behavior graph, with each node weighted by anticipated reward value evaluated through knowledge.

\-------

My goal is to build a model free artificial intelligence which learns through trial and error, creates abstractions, applies those abstractions to related objects which drive behavior choice. I don't want to write any finite state machine code, so I've been trying to come up with a generalized intelligence model which can be applied to a variety of character types with a variety of motivators which drive behavior choice. Am I missing anything here? Did I get anything wrong?

I've got a rough working model in code and am ironing out wrinkles before I start scaling this to lots of objects and dozens of agents.

Bitcoin,Art imitates life(my thoughts on how what we are witnessing is truly epic),"I wrote this as a reply to someone who asked me what the fed is dealing with right now. I am sharing it because it made me realize how truly worthy of a movie this all is. One day we might watch said movie and think back to how crazy of a time this is economically:


""The fed is trying to reverse the course it has been on for the past ten years. They are trying to get rates to the ""normal"" range after being so low for so long. The problem is that it affects the price of bonds in a way that the 2 year bond becomes more expensive than the ten year bond. This is called a ""yield curve inversion"". Every time this has happened a recession has come within 6-12 months of that. Also, rising bond rates entices investors to become interested in bonds again because they are a safe way to make money (for obvious reasons). This obviously pulls money from the stock market because people are trying to diversify their portfolios and find ways to make money. If you Google the Dow Jones average the past couple of days you will see there is a major correction going on. Also, trump knows this is what's happening and has publicly made statements about how he thinks the fed is being too aggressive with the rate hikes. It's dangerous to invert the yield curve right now because rates are still historically low. This is dangerous because the fed typically lowers rates during recessions to take pressure off the economy to help turn it around. If they don't have the tools they need to fight off a recession we might have to go back into another round of quantitative easing and might even face negative interest rates and another ""great recession"" or worse. Imagine a bank account that takes money out of your account because you park it there? Bonds won't yield anything and stocks/house prices will shoot through the roof again because that's the only place investors will be able to make/protect their money. The only place besides bitcoin, of course. The government won't be able to touch that and bakkt will allow pretty much anyone an onramp. Also, trade wars are adding to the pressure of all of this. It's some pretty fucked up stuff. So if the stock market goes through more of these corrections or even encounters a crash, the publics sentiment of what bitcoin is will be visible by seeing how the price holds up. If the price remains relatively stable... Then WOW. Buy some more because we will have something outside of government control that people truly believe in. This really is like the season finale to the bitcoin saga. Real life really does write the best stories sometimes. The timing of all this couldn't have been any more epic.

gaming,I just beat Conker's Bad Fur Day...,"I was not even 3 yet when this game first came out, so naturally, beyond *maybe* minor snippets of some ads and seeing some copies at Blockbuster, I don't really have much memories of this game. I do remember the 2005 Xbox remake, but that's not what I'm gonna get into. Also, I heard it's trash, soo...

Anyways, cut to the recent summer, and I go to a small game store. I look around and find some good titles I haven't played yet, only to stumble upon two copies of Conker's Bad Fur Day for the N64. By this point, I've heard a lot more about this particular game, including seeing some gameplay footage, some videos from a Let's Player (PewDiePie, if you're wondering), the high costs of the damn thing, and even the... interesting, [original commercial for the game](https://youtu.be/5fcid8H3bbo). So, naturally, it was kinda interesting to see some copies over there. Curious, I ask the guy to have me see the copies and their prices. They were both $50, and after some consideration, I purchased my Blockbuster-labeled (I swear, I hear so many people on and offline say they rented/purchased this game from BB) cartridge. Yes: Why play it on an emulator or play it on Rare Replay when could I literally spend $50 on an old cartridge that was probably under the hands of at least one spiky-haired, energy-drink-drowning pot head. 

Between August up until now, through some trial-and-error and the occasional play through video, I played through probably the most interesting $50 object that I ever spent on... Dare I say, I think it was actually *worth* it.

Trust me when I say that I actually had a lot of fun throughout the game. The gameplay varieties were nice, the general gameplay mechanics were good, Conker was pretty likable (although I didn't like how he treated Rodent. :( ), and the environments were really nice. I also liked how many things were stuffed into the game, including some very good graphics (for N64 standards) and the large amount of voice acting and good music throughout the game. The technical aspects of the whole thing is honestly impressive, especially for a console than was already unimpressive when it first came out (think about how much could fit onto a 650 mb PS1 CD versus a 64 mb cartridge). 

I was also surprised about how easy it was, especially for a game aggressively made and marketed for adults. The only big reason why I would have difficulty with a level was because I needed to do more than I was doing. For example, I had to aim my piss stream in a way that I wasn't doing beforehand in the Rock Party level. Even the increases in difficulty in each level weren't very huge as I would've expected. 

Of course, there were some things that I wasn't a big fan of. The humor is... not my favorite. If I was 9-12 again, I probably would've drowned in tears and laughter by this game. At 20... I'm just kinda bored of it. There were parts that I did laugh at, including some of the dumb stuff (I chuckled at the sunflower part), but for the most part, it wasn't really my thing. I know this was released at a time when edgy, childish South Park/Mad TV-esque humor was sort of cool and hip, but it sure hasn't made the game age well in the humor aspect.

The movie references were sometimes a tad bit cringey (""Ha ha, look! We're referencing Saving Private Ryan!""), though the Matrix reference did offer a very fun gameplay change... Even if it reminded me of that one Early 2000's trend when [every](https://youtu.be/viCjtSFsKb0) [single](https://youtu.be/3BWWXa8wTV4) [thing](https://youtu.be/sHTeguzrPto) had a Matrix bullet-time reference. A lot of the side characters were also either bland, generally unlikable, or even annoying (like that broom thing). Probably the only side character I liked was Rodent the soldier... and that's it. 

Still, as I finally finish typing this an hour or so after the credits, I must say that I'm actually a bit saddened... Not just because there's not much else to the game anymore, but (SPOILERS) the ending even gave off a good message of how your own simple life is probably a lot more ideal than what someone richer and more powerful than you has, as Conker, a newly-crowned king, now can't enjoy his previous life of a girlfriend, a home and a bottle of beer... Something that he seems to only be able to cover by getting drunk. (SPOILERS ARE OVER, GUYS!!!)

Still, I must say that I'm very pleased to both spend my time and money on such a fun and unique game... and I think that's why it's still so much liked upon even today. It's a unique game for the N64, the era it came out of (not a lot of games have you literally pissing away some fire creatures), and even today. There were things I didn't care for, but you know what, I still really liked this game... Dare I say, it may be one of my new favorite games of all time. 

With all this said, what do you guys think?",technology

Bitcoin,ELI5/15/25/FAQ for Statechains: Off-chain Transfer of UTXO Ownership,"&amp;#x200B;

Move bitcoin UTXOs entirely off-chain. Enables instant off-chain creation of Lightning channels, with the ability to easily add or remove funds, and more.

&amp;#x200B;

# ELI5

Statechains let you spend bitcoins without using the bitcoin blockchain (""off-chain""). Spending the bitcoins requires the help of a third party. If they don't help, you can also do it without their help on the bitcoin blockchain. A little bit of trust is required.

&amp;#x200B;

# ELI15

You lock up bitcoins on-chain with a third party -- the Statechain entity. In order to transfer the bitcoins, you sign a message telling the entity that you want to move the coins to a new owner. You simultaneously pass on your transitory key to that new owner, meaning both of you have equal control over the coins. The entity ensures that only the wishes of the last owner get fulfilled. If they misbehave, it is easily detectable.

&amp;#x200B;

# ELI25

Bob (B) locks up coins with Statechain entity A, but instead of using his key B, he creates and uses a transitory key X (this private key will be exposed to future owners). An off-chain timelock transaction will be created back to B, ensuring the coins return to Bob in case of a dispute. If Bob wants to send his coins to Carol, he does three things:

* He signs a message stating he wants to transfer the coins to Carol (signed by B and C)
* Together with the entity, he signs a bitcoin timelock transaction for Carol (signed by A and X)
* These signatures are swapped atomically using Adaptor Signatures (preventing problems with aborting the protocol)

We use Eltoo to ensure the new timelock transaction takes precedence over the old one(s). Multiple UTXOs can be swapped simultaneously as well. For more details, check out the [presentation](http://youtu.be/FI9cwksTrQs?t=47m36s) and [paper](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Avm99d6Nf8PGgp414rF-49twiypBOQ).

&amp;#x200B;

# FAQ

&amp;#x200B;

**Q1**: *If I have 1 BTC locked up on a Statechain, can I send less than that amount?*

**A1:** You can think of Statechains as the equivalent of real-life coins. In order to send less, you will first have to trade your 1 BTC for smaller amounts. E.g. You can swap your 1 BTC coin for two 0.5 BTC coins. You can do this trade with anyone who is online and willing. Alternatively, you can create a Lightning channel on top of a Statechain.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q2:** *How does Lightning function on top of Statechains?*

**A2:** It ends up working quite elegantly. If Bob wants to send coins to Carol, he can create a channel instead. From the perspective of the Statechain, this means both Bob and Carol must agree before the coins can move, and they can proceed to build their Lightning channel on top of it. Because channel creation happens off-chain, you gain some tremendous benefits. It becomes very easy to recreate the channel, and add or remove funds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q3:** *Aren't Statechains less secure than Lightning?*

**A3:** Yes, you're making a trade-off. The Statechain entity should be a federation of multiple entities, similar to Liquid. This means a majority needs to become dishonest before you can lose money. They also require the cooperation of a prior owner (someone that knows the transitory key) before they can steal anything. Theoretically we can add an extra layer of security by using Hardware Security Modules (HSM) to transfer the transitory key, but this technology is not mature enough.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q4:** *Why not just use federated sidechains instead?*

**A4:** The transitory key adds additional security. If the federation goes rogue, they will only be able to obtain a small subset of all transitory keys. As soon as they steal any coins, people without compromised transitory keys can safely withdraw on-chain. This is because you can always redeem your coins on the bitcoin blockchain without specifically asking the federation for permission. From a legal perspective, the entity cannot be seen as a money transmitter, because they lack direct access to the transitory keys (similar to greenaddress), so the barrier to operating a Statechain is much lower.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q5:** *How does this compare to Lightning channel factories?*

**A5:** Lightning channel factories require less security trade-offs, but you can only change channels with the people inside your factory, and it requires all of them to be online. Anthony Towns and Olaoluwa Osuntokun ( u/roasbeef ) pointed out that factories can be useful on top of Statechains, because it lowers the required number of on-chain UTXOs per user, and you can add/remove users from the factory off-chain.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q6:** *What are my options if I want to exit a Statechain?*

**A6:** Everyone has a valid on-chain transaction that they can use at any time to redeem their bitcoins, but it is more efficient to close the channel cooperatively. Assuming graftroot gets adopted, this would be the ideal way to exit the system, because it allows the owner to decide what the redemption transaction will look like, and it even gives them the ability to withdraw coins from different bitcoin hard forks (if any occurred during the time the coins were in the Statechain). This solves the problem of uncertainty over which coins will be honored in case of a hard fork (ETF, exchanges, etc).

personalfinance,Repay loan or keep stock?,"Hi all

I have a loan of $30K (down from $70K) with an interest rate of 9.8% (after fed hike) and $52K in one of the FANG stocks. I am torn between repaying that loan vs keeping the stock intact. I feel like the stock has better growth potential than throwing it away at a loan I'll repay in 2 years but I feel like the interest in paying on it is not worth it. Any suggestions or advice on how to think about this",finance
personalfinance,80/20 Mortgage Questions,"Hi there,
I need assistance with applying for a mortgage.  I currently rent a 1 bedroom apt in the Bronx with my S/O and our 2 dogs.  Our rent is $1,300.00 per month and I can’t help but feel that amount would be a decent mortgage payment.  I want to get started but I have never done this before and I can’t rely on my parents for financial planning advice as they haven’t really done anything like this before and in the past, they haven’t made the best financial decisions.  

So here are the details:

Annual Salary and Savings

$143,000.00 Current combined annual salary

$6,800 monthly take home (conservative)

$29,000 Total savings accounts

$2,000.00 total combined checking accounts

Expenses

$1,300.00 monthly rent

$100.00 monthly electric bill (approx.)

$160.00 combined Cell phone bills

$80.00 misc. monthly medical expense

$550.00 average monthly food budget

$75.00. Average monthly internet bill

$80.00 monthly haircuts, misc.

$60.00 monthly Vape supplies

$140.00 monthly entertainment expenses

$0.00 credit cards

We must be spending money elsewhere because we are only saving approx. $3,200-$3,500 per month.

We have no existing loans or other debts.  No cars or travel expenses.  No credit card balances,etc.

I want to explore the options of 100% mortgage financing (an 80/20 mortgage loan).  Is it a bad idea (do they still exist) ?  What are the pros and cons?  Should we wait until we have saved 20% down?  What if interest rates increase dramatically within the next 2 years and by time we have saved 20% for the down payment, the rates have increased up to 7%?

Currently, we have very good/excellent credit.
1 has approx 750 credit score and the other has approx 775 credit score.  The 775 credit has annual salary of 87K and the 750 credit has a salary of 56k annually.

Also, out of the $29,000 we have already allocated 24K toward our emergency fund so that cannot be used for the purchase of the house.

So what do you think we should do?",finance

personalfinance,Recent grad seeking advice on what to do with savings/extra income,"Hi everybody. I'm a recent graduate who is currently working in the bay area and looking for general financial advice. I'm lucky enough to be living rent free, able to use my parents car, and have them help me with insurance so my monthly expenses are currently pretty low. I'll probably be in this situation for about the next 6 months or so, so I'm trying to put my extra money to the best use possible. I currently have about $23000 saved up from my current job and working while in college. I talked to a financial advisor  at my bank, and a lot of what he said already lined up with what I was planning on doing. He told me not to invest, and to establish my emergency fund and focus on paying back my loans. I'm mainly seeking advice on what to do with my current savings I have.

Income:
My take home monthly pay is ~$3200. The first few months I contributed 5% to a traditional 401k but recently switched to 10% to a Roth 401k.

Monthly Budget:

Gas $250 (I commute pretty far but am happy with my living situation for the near future at least)

Groceries $100

Payment to parents $200 ($100 is for bridge tolls that get charged to their card, the other $100 is just to give them something for helping me with food, car insurance, etc. This could be more or less depending on how they feel about it.)

Eating at restaurants with my SO $100-$200


I feel pretty good about my budget and it totals around $700 a month. I know I could go out to eat less, but that's pretty much the only thing I spend money on other than my necessities. I've put the other ~$6000 from my current job into my savings while I figured out what I want to do with it.

Student Loans:

I plan on using the avalanche method for my private loans. I have 7 federal loans that total about ~$21000 as of now. They're a combination of subsidized and unsubsidized and all have interest rates from 3.76%-4.66%. I expect the total payments for these to be ~$200, so I'm not as worried about these and plan on making the minimum payments either until they're paid off or close until the 10 years is up.

I have 3 larger private loans with higher interest rates.

Loan 1: $14000 principal, $3176 accrued interest, 8.24%

Loan 2: $13000 principal, $1214 accrued interest, 7.74%

Loan 3: $16000 principal, $1752 accrued interest, 5.9%


I expect each loan payment to be around $200 a month, bringing my total student loan cost to around $800 a month. With my private loan holder, once my loans go into repayment the monthly payments will go towards a little bit of principal and mainly interest. They said any additional amount I pay can't touch the principal until all of the outstanding interest of that loan is paid off. I plan on making a large payment on my Private Loan 1 to get rid of all the accrued interest and start chipping away at the principal.

My current plan:

Emergency fund: Put $8000 into the ally savings account I just opened. Keep $1000 in my checking account and $1000 in my savings account at my current bank so I have quicker access to a decent amount of money. I know this is a lot for my current budget, but once I move to my own place this amount of money should cover me for 3-4 months. And since I already have enough money for that I'd rather just set it aside now.

Savings for a car: I would put around ~$5000 into another savings account to set aside for a down payment on a car. I plan on buying a used car in the range of $10000-$16000 in around 6 months. I plan to make a really large down payment or just pay it all at once depending on what type of car I decide to get. I don't need to buy a car right away so this is pretty flexible.

This leaves me with around $8000. I would either put all of this or most of it towards my Private Loan 1. I may pay a little less off and put some more towards saving for a car.

Since I have about $2500 left a month, I plan on putting around $1500 towards my loans and $1000 in savings towards my car for the next few months. I'll put all of the $1500 on Private Loan 1 until my loans go into repayment, and then pay the minimum on all the loans and put the extra $700 towards Private Loan 1.

Seeking advice/questions:

I'm mostly seeking advice on what to with my current savings. I know I could put a lot of that into my loans now, but I feel like it's a wasted opportunity to not invest at least some of it. I'm not too familiar with Roth IRAs, but would it put a good idea to put a few thousand or even $5500 in it right now while I can? Or put my money somewhere else? I was also wondering about refinancing at least my two loans with the highest interest rate. I'm also not too familiar with this since I don't know anybody personally who has refinanced their loans. And if I do refinance my loans, is it better to put my large payments on my current Private Loan 1 now or to wait until I refinance?

Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

So here I am, pumping in money, energy, and time into trying to remodel a house and not suceeding because I suck at interior design, feeling like I'm just wasting money and time.  I've forgone vacations/and some friends just spillling time and money into this. and now I have to finish it, since half of my house has green shag carpet and wallpaper while the the other half has modern wood floors and trim. 

&amp;#x200B;

To add insult to injury, I don't really like the end result! I keep kicking myself...I SHOULD have just bought the nicer remodeled house originally, had I known what I know now, I would of bought the remodeled houses (which would of been closer to 300,000 versus my house price of 236,000).  my income is close to 140,000 a year now so I could easily afford it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering selling and buying a new one, but my interest rate I got was locked so low (3.375%), and the current rates are 4.8%, which equates to me spending an additional 200 bucks a month just from the interest. add transaction fees to that/etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I go home every day frustrated because of this. its really put a damper on my life. Im not sure what to do? I think I Am psychologically hooked to this place since Ive invested so much energy and time and money in it. I wonder If I can jjust sit back, evaluate whats actually important in my life, and just forgot about it and be glad I have a home to live in  (even though its half finished)

Hi everyone !

We are Oblatif Games, a small indie game studio, and we are launching the Kickstarter campaign for our first title : Man of the Stars.

[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/352066108/man-of-the-stars?ref=category\_newest&amp;ref=discovery](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/352066108/man-of-the-stars?ref=category_newest&amp;ref=discovery)

Man of the Stars is a survival sandbox MMOFPS placed in the sci-fi genre.It features a building system allowing the player and his friends to build a base that they'll have to defend against other players attacks, with the whole array of PVP gameplay a FPS has to offer. The player will build these bases upon an infinite number of worlds procedurally generated, with multiple characteristics, such like deserts, forests, islands, airless moons. These worlds are linked by a portal network, allowing other players to set foot on these worlds.On these terrains various resources are to be found and harvested by the player in order to craft objects, food, weapons, machines and constructions.

These worlds will also be stuffed with monsters lairs full of artifacts to loot. Adding to this we'll put an emphasis on PVE content, we created complex AI systems of behaviors, this allows for encounters with NPCs inhabiting the world, from cooperation to aggression. Our IA system will also provide the player with a workforce that he'll employ to manage his bases and reinforce his military actions.

In addition of these worlds built for conquest, we put at the players' disposal social worlds, where they'll have the opportunity to craft alliances with a guild system, sell their merchandise, and propose and accept job offers in our universe.

We wished to reach your community since we think it might interest you, don't hesitate to share if you like the project ! :)

Thanks for giving it a look !",technology
personalfinance,Calculating apy/ interest for savings account.,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I am having a hard time matching monthly interest I received in my Discover savings account compared to the advertised APY. I was hoping somebody can help me understand how it works.

&amp;#x200B;

The advertised APY is 1.90% (current interest rate: 1.88%), but by dividing the interest received in Sep 2018 to the balance by the end of Aug 2018, I am getting more like 1.45%. I called Discover and I was told they do their calculation on 3-month cycle, and because I have been moving funds frequently throughout the 3-month period (I did move 86% of my fund out in AUG 2018), that may have made the interest I received in Sep looked lower. I was also told if I keep my balance steady for longer period of time, the APY will become closer to that advertised 1.9%.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still a little confused by how that works. Can anyone explain to me if it makes sense to you?

&amp;#x200B;

The second job is relatively new and the double paychecks have reeeeeeaaaaaly taken some pressure off financially.

Job 2: Weekly Gross: $1100 - $57200/year

Total: $1950/week - $101400/year

How much additional tax should I request from both? The math overwhelms me a bit, and you folks are wizards at this stuff.",finance

personalfinance,How to allocate extra money at the end of the month?,"My husband and I have finally reached a point in our financial lives where we occasionally have decent chunks of ""extra"" money leftover at the end of the month. I'm talking after everything (savings, IRA/retirement contributions, 
 min payments, etc.), so I want to use it in the best way possible. Some months we have $100 extra, other months it's $1,000, and sometimes it's $0. I want to figure out the best way to allocate these ""extra"" monies toward our various debts and savings. I think I just need help figuring out the best way to set up a spreadsheet or equation to figure this out... let's just take this month for example.

Based on my projections, we are on track to have $700 leftover at the end of the month. I could either:

* Put extra toward the principle on our truck loan, which has about $20k left at 4.74% (the min we pay every month is $330ish)

* Put extra toward the principle on our mortgage, which has about $178k left at 3.25% (min payment is about $1200/mo -- we do pay PMI and all since we only put down 5% -- it's about $90/mo altogether)

* Save it in our long-term savings account which currently has a 1.88% interest rate. This is appealing because we would like to be able to put down 20% for our next home, since I don't think we will get as good an interest rate next time around (the 3.25% rate is because we are first time homeowners). We also hope to move in the next 2-5 years.

* Some combination of X% extra toward truck, X% extra toward mortgage, and X% into savings?

For some context, we do technically have a decent amount in savings, but it's currently allocated to our emergency fund and home maintenance (both anticipated and not). So while we technically have the money to put toward the DP on our second home (plus our equity in our current home), I prefer to leave those amounts alone for the purposes they are designated for. Don't want to buy a new home and then have no money for necessary maintenance...

Edit: Usually I would just take things in order of the interest rates, but I felt like the amounts here mattered enough to think about tackling it in a different way.",finance

Fortunately, the Chase Reserve card has trip cancellation and interruption insurance - it's one of the reason's I pay $450/year for the credit card.

So I figured the process would annoying at worst.  Boy, I couldn't have been more wrong.  This insurance is outsourced to a company called ""Card Benefit Services"".  Basically, this company helps you with all your insurance claims related to this credit card, not just travel insurance.

Although all the customer service people are kind, the process has been nothing short of a nightmare.  The only item on my claim is a hotel room stay - thank God I don't have many items to claim.  I've uploaded every document they've asked for, and have continued to be asked for confusing and obscure documents.  Every time I upload a new document it takes 2 weeks (or more) for review.  And I literally can't talk to anyone about what they're exactly looking for.  No one knows what's going on, and it's clear they're completely understaffed

I keep being told 2-3 more days, I'll ad a note to your file, it's going to be reviewed shortly, or upload this, upload that.  Every customer service rep tells me something different.

I'm not a dumb person, but this process has been so confusing and frankly a waste of my time.  At this point, I feel that the insurance company is not upholding their duty as an insurer, and I'm considering filing a small claims lawsuit to just get them to pay me back!

personalfinance,I recently came into a large sum of money and don't really know if this is the correct way I should be spending it. (CAN),"Hello! 

I recently came to a 'large' (large to me) amount of money, about $10,000 and currently there is no use for the money that is kinda why I want to invest it. I recently visited my Scotiabank financial adviser. The money has been put into a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) and in the TFSA $5,000 will be used in a GIC (Guaranteed Investment Certificate) of 15 month (Interest rate is 2.62%). 

The other $5,000 will be used in a 2 year GIC plan with an interest rate of 2.8%.  Every month the bank will be withdrawing $300 from my personal chequing account to add onto the TFSA.

They were also talking about a Mutual Fund with Medium Risk Tolerance.

I am very unsure if I made the right choice or not. I am also wondering if there are any better options to increase my interest rate long term. Is it worth investing my money into the Mutual Fund or will it most likely have a negative effect?

Well, I did it - I hit a Bingo jackpot on the 33rd ball (O 70) and won a chance to spin for a prize between $5k and $50k. I hit $10,000. The next day I put it in my savings account. Of course, I'm well aware of taxes (I've dealt with ""game winnings"" before and had to pay $300 for a bunch of Yeti coolers I won doing a BBQ adventure over Texas...long story) and preparing to pay 30%.

My wife (who is very financially responsible, more so than myself) came up with a list of what to do with the money. Some of the ideas that I am considering:

* placing as much in as I could to get me to $18,500 in my 401(k) contributions.
   * Pros: Obvs saving for retirement, $10k compounding over 35 years in
   * Cons: Don't have the money for another 35 years
* Keep in savings. Could use down the road for down payment on land/next house
   * Pros: Not spending it now, money grows (albeit slightly) until I
   * Cons: ""Low"" interest rate...1.7%
* Invest
   * Pros: Could make more money than any account
   * Cons: Not sure ""How"" to invest. Is this in the stock market? Is this buying a small home and renovating/renting it out?
* Buy something
   * This is probably the least likeliest and to be honest, I don't know what I would buy, and I wouldn't want to spend much. There isn't much that I need in life.
   * Pros: Instant gratification
   * Cons: I don't have the money any more.
* Pay off debt
   * I owe $20k on a 2016 truck that I'm 3 years from paying off. Payments aren't killing me and the loan is at 1.24%.
   * Mortgage: Wife and I owe $69k on the house. Mortgage, insurance and taxes are $1100 per month and we're able to pay something like $1450 + any tax refund goes to the mortgage every year. We should have it paid off in 5 years.
   * Other than that, I'm debt free.
   * Pros: Saves money in the long run
   * Cons: Doesn't save us much money. I think value of having cash in hand outweighs the $150 or so I'd save on the truck in interest if I put this towards it.

Sorry for the long post. Much appreciated.

She likes holding onto money like it's the last dollar on earth and while I can save, I like to spend more than her, but would like the idea of investing/taking some calculated risk.

CryptoCurrency,The federal reserve banks will not allow the mass adoption of Crypto.,"Theres nothing you can do about it at this moment.    

They won't allow crypto to replace money.  

Because they do not yet know how to effectively  control crypto. All of the power they have rely on people having trust that paper money has value.

If that disappears, they lose their power over us. 

We might get our nice little bubbles every couple years or so, but its not gonna get out of control unless they figure out how to control it. 


On a side note, 

I also have theory as to why Crypto isn't recovering.   

Politics. People are so distracted with politics, metoo, trump or what have you,  that they simply dont have the time to entertain crypto. 


We All know how theory 's work.    Maybe people are saving for the holidays?  😒",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How to protect capital against Italy leaving the Euro? (IT),"Let's assume Italy will leave the euro within the next year and the new currency is instantly devalued 30-40% against the euro. 

 This scenario is not super likely but still likely enough I want to reasonably protect against it, by accepting a small loss in case the event actually happens, but without taking too many risks in case it doesn't happen.

Some options I considered:

- Get an online bank account from a German bank (i.e. N26). Problems: it's not guaranteed this won't be converted to a new lira. Also, 0% return rate.

- Buy an ETF containing German/French bonds. Problem: negative yields, interest rate rises would lead to permanent losses, and it's very unlikely that interest rates would go down at this point in the EU.

- Buy an aggregate EU ETF. It has a positive yield (1%), but also contains more risky bonds (Italy, Spain).

- Buy american treasuries. Great in case of an actual italexit, but carries a big currency exchange risk if there is no italexit.

- Yolo: load up on italian bonds, enjoy a 3-4% yield, and find a benevolent god to pray to.

- Cryptocurrencies: no. Just no.",finance

Or do I have to clam  “2” now so I pay less in taxes per check (owe Uncle Sam) until it adds up to $4502 to make the EV Credit count?

btc,Blockchainers and off-chainers,"I want to hear everyone's thoughts about adopting a new terminology for differentiating our vision for Bitcoin from that of BTC. I'm proposing that instead of talking about ""big-blockers"" and ""small-blockers"" it could be helpful to talk about ""blockchainers"" and ""off-chainers"". 

We all know how important narrative is in cryptocurrency. We've long had the global financial and political system trying to undermine Bitcoin in the eyes of the public, and we've gotten used to BTC folks smearing Bitcoin Cash online. I think a change in terminology could be especially helpful in combatting the latter.

Let me explain my reasoning. It has now become undeniable that the ""small block"" or BTC side of this multi year-long scaling debate is not merely insisting on caution. Rather, they are ideologically opposed to growing the capacity of the blockchain, full stop. We may speculate at length about the motivations for this incoherent position, but what's beyond debate is that, for them, ""Bitcoin"" is no longer synonymous with the blockchain, and they are doing everything possible to encourage users to avoid the blockchain.

Key figures have embraced high fees, proposed that a network of off-chain payment channels be used instead of the blockchain, suggested that fiat and credit cards are a superior means for making payments, and have now released a ""[federated sidechain](https://blockstream.com/strong-federations.pdf)"" to process off-chain payments for ""commercial applications"". Like many here, my position has long been to welcome technologies like Lightning and Liquid, so long as they are implemented as a supplement and not a substitute for the blockchain, as we've been seeing.

A shift in terminology could be helpful in three respects: 

1. To highlight that the debate is not about the best way to *scale* Bitcoin, but about what Bitcoin *is.* Bitcoin is fundamentally the e-cash system that we describe as the proof-of-work blockchain.

2. The popular ""big"" and ""small"" block distinction suggests a misleading equality between these two arguments. Either, it would seem, is a valid way of developing Bitcoin. But as we've seen, failure to allow greater capacity on the blockchain undermines it as a technology for electronic cash. Hence, the choice is not between a small blockchain and a large blockchain, it's between using the blockchain and using something else.

3. Finally, after a decade of intense interest, discussion and research, it's not clear that Satoshi was wrong about any of the fundamental assumptions or design of Bitcoin. Off-chain payment solutions inevitably compromise on key elements of Bitcoin's design, and they generate problems that seemingly require the *blockchain* as to solve. The blockchain keeps returning as the simplest way forward, so why not simply embrace it instead of replacing it?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Federal Loans Sold and Turned into Private Variable Loans,"I had my loans serviced through Citibank years ago and when I set up the original documentation I used my school based email address which is now dead and I of course did not download the documents in my infinite teenage wisdom, or if I had the computer they were on is now also long dead.

I know one of these loans was a Subsidized federal loans which when sold to Sallie Mae and became a variable interest private loan.

I am unsure of what the status of the second loan prior to being sold.

I have called Discover and Sallie Mae for the original loan documentation and will be contacting my schools to see if they can help me with any original loan documentation as well.

My interest rate has risen 2% over the last 10 months on these 2 loans and I'd like to prevent any further increases.

I have already attempted to apply for consolidation and was rejected due to the age of the loans and the amount I have in loans despite having a high credit score FICO: 780.

Should I refinance into a fixed loan with the same company? Or would i hit a wall due to the same issues with consolidation?

personalfinance,"My wife and I are about to go through a big change in our lives, financially. Please take a look at our finances and let me know if you spot an issue that I missed!","This sub has been so helpful to at every stage of my life. I probably should have checked in before making final decisions but things have happened quickly. Here's the short version: **my wife and I are self-employed musicians, although I just got hired as a salaried church music director which gives us access to health insurance fortunately. We're about 2 months pregnant with our first child (due next April), and we are about to close on a house (currently we own a condo).**

My income is quite steady, hers is a little less predictable so when running numbers I generally leave it out of the equation just to be safe.

    MONTHLY INCOME:
    
    $3,340   Me (self employed)
    $2,750   Me (salaried)
    $  900   Her (self employed)
    
    $6,090   My total
    $6,990   Our total

This doesn't include less predictable income, primarily weddings and funerals every now and then. We have decent savings, I'll also list current assets/equity and the new house purchase.

    $25,921  Savings (not including money going to downpayment/closing)
    $23,923  Equity (still owe another $41,077 on condo, paid $65,000 for it)
    $20,000  Roth IRA (fairly diversified right now)
    
    2011 Ford Focus SE
    2006 Pontiac G6

    $215,000 Purchase price for house
    $164,800 Mortgage, 30-year fixed with 4.990% interest rate

Since I'm more interested in the near future than our current (significantly cheaper) situation, some of these budget items will be estimates. All numbers are monthly.

    $973     Taxes (estimating 15% of income to taxes, I would guess it will be lower but we'll see)
    $447     Health insurance premiums + dental/vision (Blue Cross Blue Shield)
    $459     Roth IRA contributions (new salaried job comes with pension as well, vested after 4 or 5 years)
    $400     Healthcare OOP (just an estimate)
    $884     Mortgage payments
    $ 72     Home insurance (Progressive)
    $310     Property taxes
    $250     Utilities (estimate for 1,600 sq. ft. house, at our condo we pay $80)
    $300     Groceries
    $400     Gas (we drive a lot for work)
    $225     Auto insurance for both cars
    $163     Cell phones (T-Mobile)

    $ 60     Subscriptions (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Apple Music, iCloud backup, Backblaze backup)
    
    $4,983   Total expenses

That's everything that's figured out. You might notice that this budget doesn't include any personal spending, clothing, household expenses (like cleaning supplies), or anything like that. It also doesn't factor in expenses for a child at ALL because I haven't even started trying to budget that out yet. Here's an overview and net totals now:

     $6,090   Income (Plus ~$900 bonus)

    -$  973   Taxes
     $5,117   Subtotal
    
    -$  447    Health premiums
     $4,670    Subtotal
    
    -$  459    Roth IRA contributions
     $4,211    Subtotal
    
    -$1,266    Mortgage + insurance + taxes
     $2,945    Subtotal
    
    -$1,838    All other expenses
     $1,107    Total remaining (Plus ~$900 bonus)

I think that's everything I have. I welcome all comments, questions, criticisms, advice, etc. Especially with regards to the house. Feel free to tell me if you think we purchased outside of our budget, or advice you have for avoiding the house becoming more expensive than necessary. Tell me if we're paying too much for something, or missing something critical that needs to be budgeted.

personalfinance,Looking for readable books on economics.,"I realize this isn't strictly personal finance, but I think people who post here would have the best idea of what is out there. 

I have read A Random Walk Down Wall Street and Common Sense on Mutual Funds and loved them. Both books covered investing and some history of the markets, but neither really explained the grand scheme of things. They more or less provided data to prove the theory of efficient markets and helped boost my confidence in index investing.

I'm looking to better understand the relationship between labor, capital, interest rates, the Federal Reserve... And whatever else there is to know.

I bought The Wealth of Nations, but I couldn't quite get into it. Definitely a bit intimidating for me. At the same time, I'm not a complete idiot and I'm looking for straight up facts and explanations without being some dramatic story or an ELI5. 

Open to any suggestions, even an easier textbook that is readable. Let me know what you've read.

# **Earnings could be what turns the tide for stocks** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/12/earnings-could-be-what-turns-the-tide-for-stocks.html)*

* Earnings season gets underway in the week ahead, and that could help calm some of the frayed nerves in the stock market if corporate outlooks remain positive.
* Stocks bounced on Friday, and the S&amp;P 500 landed back on an important technical level, a positive way to start the week ahead.
* Fed speakers and minutes from the Fed's last meeting will be a big focus, after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish comments suggesting more rate hikes sparked a recent jump in interest rates.

*****
&gt; Stocks fell on Friday after the release of mixed employment data jolted interest rates higher.
*****
&gt; After the wildest market week in months, investors are looking to U.S. corporate earnings season to soothe frayed nerves in the coming week.
*****
&gt; Stocks sold off sharply in the past week, and even with a bounce back on Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was down 4.1 percent. A sudden jump in interest rates and worries about the impact of tariffs and trade disputes on earnings drove stocks lower, with some of the worst losses in growth stocks.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P ended the week on a high note, up 1.4 percent on Friday but closing at 2,767, one point above its 200-day moving average. The moving average is a momentum measure, and it is widely watched, even beyond stock market chartists.
*****
&gt; ""The S&amp;P 500 closed right on the 200-day. It's just like a magnet. Everyone looks at these levels as super important, and that's where it ended up,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. ""We enter next week on tenterhooks. There's a whole lot of nervousness. ... Sitting on support, rather than sitting on resistance, is always a better way to enter the earnings season.""

&gt; Companies reporting in the week ahead include Bank of America on Monday; Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Johnson and Johnsonand IBM on Tuesday; Abbott Labs on Wednesday; American Expresson Thursday and Procter and Gamble on Friday.

# Why Bulls Smile After Midterm Elections

&gt; Volatility is heating up in October, with some big drops for stocks late last week. Now let’s put things in perspective. The S&amp;P 500 Index just had its least volatile third quarter since 1963, and it hasn’t closed up or down more than 1% for more than three months in a row—one of the longest streaks ever. Not to mention the S&amp;P 500 has been up six months in a row, and some type of volatility or correction is perfectly typical. It might feel bad when it happens, but pullbacks are a normal part of bull markets.

&gt; “Some pre-midterm volatility could be in the cards, but the good news is that looking at the past 18 midterms (back to 1946), the S&amp;P 500 was higher a year later every single time,” said Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. This helps put in perspective just how much of a tailwind the calendar could be for investors here.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 has been up 14.5% on average a year after all midterm elections going back to 1946. In addition, all 18 midterms saw higher returns 12 months later.

# So “Sell in May” Didn’t Work This Year?

&gt; Not so fast. The answer is: We don’t know yet, the Worst Six Months (WSM) are not over yet. People forget that Sell in May is NOT the whole seasonality. Our Best and Worst Months Tactical Switching Strategies are based on the Dow’s and S&amp;P’s Best Six Months (BSM) from November through April and the Worst Six Months from May through October, and NASDAQ’s Best Eight Months (B8M) from November through June and the Worst Four Months (W4M) from July through October. 

&gt; The market’s rise from May through September was impressive, but folks forgot about October. NASDAQ just made its lowest close since May. And from our NASDAQ Best Eight Months Seasonal Sell Sign on June 21, 2018 at 7712.95 it’s down 5.0% at yesterday’s close. 

&gt; The past two days have reminded everyone of October’s frightful history of crashes, corrections and market calamities. Our October Almanac points out that October is the best midterm month, but we also warned of October’s scary record. 

&gt; “The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens…. This year is a midterm year, but the market has been resilient thus far during the Worst Months which may temper full-month October results.” 

&gt; October isn’t over yet, it could still be up solidly after another fast correction, which would likely also give us a sweet Seasonal MACD Buy Signal. Sell in May is not dead, but let’s not count our gains or corrections before they are fully hatched. The Worst Six Months May-October (AKA Sell in May) are not over. Q4 2018 is not over either, in fact it’s only just begun. So there is plenty of time for the 4th quarter rally to materialize as well as the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-year cycle we have spoken a great deal about lately. 

&gt; In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go, perhaps as deep as the correction in Q1 this year. Remember all the talk about how long we went without a 10% correction? Well welcome to a little mean reversion. That goes double for all the conjecture that Sell in May has not been working the past 5 years. NASDAQ B8M has. But nevertheless 5 years is not a cycle or statistically significant. Nine years is a little short, but the great recession low of March 2009 was a significant moment and as noted in the table below the BSM has outperformed the WSM, by a considerable margin since 2009 with more gains from NASDAQ’s Best 8 Months. 

&gt; In all likelihood, the correction has a bit more to go until folks start asking out loud “should I sell?” And that should set up our Best Months Seasonal Buy Signal nicely.

personalfinance,First time home buyers wait or not?How long?,"Dear Redditors,
   We were recently moved from Bay area to Texas. I am first time home buyer.  We are planning to buy home about make some offers.   But suddenly I see news about interest rate hikes and tariffs.  In my past, redditors provided a valuable recommendations.  I am currently in confusion whether wait or not.  So, please do help me.",finance
personalfinance,Does the interest rate apply to debt,"Hi everyone, first things first I was a stupid kid and when my girlfriend and I lost our jobs I resorted to credit cards and now am paying the price.

Long story short I maxed out a credit card to $2000 and couldn't pay it back so I cancelled it. Not trying to escape from it just wanted to cancel all my cards to stop making stupid moves. I couldn't make any payments on it so it went to collectors.

It's been about a year and a half and I'm in a much better place financially and want to get rid of these old debts and start to rebuild my credit. The problem is the collection agency is applying the interest rate to the amount owed, are they allowed to do this or is this a scare tactic to try and get more money out of me?

Tl;dr: Want to pay off my debt owed to collection agency but they've been applying the interest rate, is this allowed or just them trying to get more money? Should I just offer the original amount of $2000 and that's it?",finance
personalfinance,Please help me understand if it is better to get a 15 yr mortgage or 30 yr mortgage.,"So, I understand that a 15yr mortgage will generally have a lower interest rate than a 30 yr mortgage, but the monthly payments are much higher. Granted, if you have plenty of money to pay a higher monthly payment, would it be better to get the 15 yr mortgage because you’ll pay less over the long run? Or is it better to get a 30 yr mortgage with lower payments, but then put your extra cash into savings which could yield much more earnings with a generally higher interest rate earned? Also, which choice would be better if you were only planning to live in the house for 5-10 years? I hope these questions make sense. 

Edit: Wow, thank you all for the advice. I definitely feel more educated about this topic. I think the common answer is that it depends on many factors and my own personal situation to know which type of mortgage is best suited to my circumstances.",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on repaying student loans early,"I recently graduated from university and was fortunate enough to find a job within only about a month and a half that also came with a tidy $7500 signing bonus. I depleted my savings while in school so I used some of the money (around $2000 or more if PF recommends it) to get a head start on an emergency fund, I put $800 away to start saving to go back to school, and I'm going to set aside some of the money to gift myself for graduating and finding a job.

personalfinance,Saving for down payment?,"Hi all, new to this sub. I'm in my young 20s, and want to get ahead on saving for a down payment. I have a very limited knowledge of different savings methods, so thought this was a good place to start.

**General info**

Income - netting $2,500 a month

Debt - Mine - Student loans only. \~21k. Paying slightly more than the minimum payment, most under 4% interest rate, one at 4.5%.

Debt - Fiance - Student loans only. 250-300k (dentist). About 50k of his loans have 7-9% interest rates, the rest are under 4%. His loans are currently in deferment until he graduates in 4 years. He may do a repayment program to significantly cut the loans, but that's undetermined at this point.

Current savings: 7% goes into my 401k (with 4% employer match), $50/month to my HSA, and about $11k in an emergency fund in a savings account (1% interest). I'm adding an extra $300ish a month into the emergency fund.

**Goals**

My main goal is to be able to purchase a home shortly after my fiance graduates, so within 4-5 years.

I don't know if it's smarter to put my current $300/month savings towards my student loans, or contribute that to some other savings method to save for a down payment? Or is a down payment just completely out of the question given my fiance's large future student loan debts? If we should be saving for a down payment, what's the best way/place to be saving for that?

personalfinance,Seeking advice - Right time to refinance home loan,"Hey guys,

Bought our first home ~5 months ago but thinking ahead about refinancing some time next year and was hoping to get some advice regarding whether it would be a good idea to look to refinance, and if so, when would be the right time to start. Here's a summary of where this consideration is stemming from - 

My wife and I bought a condo with a 4% 15 year loan; 10% down. Monthly payments at the time of signing seemed pretty reasonable to us. But 5 months in, it is starting to become clear that we probably would have been better off with a 30 year loan now that we have a better appreciation of all of our expenses. We both have good paying jobs but we feel that we could probably use some more cash each month to invest in ETFs, set aside adequate emergency funds etc. My questions are as follows -

* Would it be a good idea to try to pay off 20% first, then only pursue refinancing? Or is even that too early? 

* We had the option to choose a 4.75% 30 year loan originally. With the rising interest rates, should we expect the interest rate we will land next year to be substantially more than that? 

Much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Best advice for a 21 y/o wanting to help with family's finances?,"I'm 21, fresh out of college with no student debt, and have a full-time job (4k/mo) lined up for next month (currently part-time in the same position at 1k/mo).

I'm living at home with minimal expenses aside from gas and groceries and now that I'll be working more, I want to help out my folks as best as I can. I love them, but I know how financially irresponsible they can be, especially when it comes to credit usage and their obsession with eventually buying a house (another conversation for another day). They're currently 43k in credit debt right now with low credit scores and I want to help them pay it off as soon as possible.

I know I don't make much in some people's standards, but it's a job I'm passionate about so I want to work with what I have. I currently have a credit balance of 2k (rough summer) that I'll pay off by the end of this year and by January, I want to begin contributing more to help the family.

My initial plan was to get a personal loan of 50k to just immediately pay off their debts in full with lower interest than their cards, but with my okay credit (730), I realize now that's easier said than done. The main factor limiting my score is that I carry a balance on only one card, resulting in a high utilization rate. I recently got approved for two cards which will raise my credit line and hopefully my score as well (after the effects of the inquiries). After paying off this balance, I am committing to paying off everything in full every month.

While I build my credit higher to qualify for lower interest rates on loans, is there anything else I should be doing to prepare myself for this beast of a debt? Or are there better options out there than getting a personal loan in the first place? I'm very new to a lot of financial knowledge/experience, but I am reading more into new topics everyday and am willing to learn as much as I need to in order to get my family out of this situation.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to any input I can get!",finance
personalfinance,What is the best way to buy a car and a house within a short time frame?,"I am planning to relocate across the country in a few months, and am looking to first buy a reliable car to drive myself and dogs across the country, and then will begin looking for my first home while staying with family. I have about $75k saved to go toward the car and homebuying costs (down payment, closing). I am looking at used Subarus around $15-$20k (will be driving through mountains/snow). The homes in the area I'm moving to are around $300-$350k. I make $125k a year. My credit score is 769, but I have no loan history as I've paid for all my previous cars with cash and went to college on scholarships.

My question is, should I buy the car with cash or get a loan? If I pay cash, I may not have enough left to make a 20% down payment, and will have a higher interest rate and PMI. If I get a loan, I could pay 20% on the house, but I would have to pay interest on the car and could possibly look risky to mortgage lenders which could also increase my rate.

personalfinance,13k EUR in debt. Been living paycheck to paycheck for a while. Finally made a financial plan to be financially stable (Hungary),"Background: I only have a high school diploma, and I had some realy rought times which caused me to have debts snowball into their current state (interest and all included): around 13k EUR total. 1 year ago I became a software developer, and starting november's paycheck I got a 50% raise which will help me to go back into positive by next year, hopefully. 

One of my loans got into KHR, which is like the credit score in the US but works a bit different. ONLY financial institutions can use it, so other kind of debts can't get in there, and it doesn't affect at all your chances to rent an apartment, get a job etc (as only financial institutions can access it and only when you apply for a loan). If a bank loan gets into collections, and the amount you still own is higher than the minimum wage after 1 month of receiving the notice, the loan goes to KHR with an ACTIVE status. This means no financial institution will give you a loan, for any reason. After you pay it off you stay there for 1 year in PASIVE status, in which you can take loans but only with some other person signing to take responsibility if you default on it. After the year it gets completely purged.
 
My debts: 
1108 EUR - Phone bill in collections. I just made a payment agreement with the collections agency, I'll pay 146 EUR every month until May 2019. 

7163 EUR - Personal loan. The biggest mistake in my life. It had a massive yearly interest rate (around 30%) and I took it for 5 years. The loan amount was around 3000 EUR, i already paid back around 2500 EUR and the outstanding amount is now at 7163... Never again.This is the loan that went into KHR. I made a payment agreement with the bank for 217 EUR monthly payment until July 2021.
 
700 EUR - Credit card, it got terminated because of the previous loan goint bad, which is actually a blessing because it stops generating interest. I'll pay 175 EUR / month until february. 

2500 EUR - Different loan, this is not in a bad status and i pay 100 EUR a month.
 
Other than that, I owe 1100 EUR to a family member, which I will have paid back by April.

And my bank account can go -1500 EUR into negatives, generating around 20% yearly interest rate, but this is calculated on a daily basis. It usually goes up to the limit every end of month, and makes around 15 EUR in interest. 
 
My nett salary after taxes, social security and pension (required by law here) is around 1500 eur. 

I just made a huge excel sheet and confirmed exact values with every party i owe to, and if I manage to only spend 300 EUR for food / cigarettes / etc in a month, by July 2019 my personal account will be on positive finally, and I'll only have the payments for the bad loan (217 eur / month) and the regular loan I have (100 EUR / month). 

After this, I'm not sure what options is better. I plan on keep only spending 300 EUR a month, maybe 400 after this poiunt. And then either pay early the loan thats regular (it wouldnt reduce the interest that i would pay, i think, so other than freeing me from a responsibility it doesnt provide much value), or wait until around March 2020 and pay back 1 year early the loan in KHR. This would add the value that I would be loan-capable again 1 year earlier. Not like I want to in-debt myself again, but you never know.

I started a Vanguard ROTH IRA in 2017, and I have maxed that out so - about $11,000 there.

I make about $62,000 a year, and intend to continue to max out the Roth, and put between $16,500 and 18,500 in the 403b per year.  

My current goal for the 403b, is just to lower my fees, and have a reasonable, mainstream allocation for my age - 47 years old.

The 403b choices for an international fund, and for a bond fund, are not fantastic.  I don't have anywhere near enough in my Roth to allow me to use Vanguard options instead of 403b options to balance my portfolio - and assuming I continue to be able to max out or nearly max out both funds - the Roth will stay too small of a % of my total retirement savings to provide an alternative for balancing my allocation for years to come.


Would you please provide some feedback as to what I should think about when choosing 403b options/allocation?

I am aiming for 80/20 stocks/bonds.  

55% of money invested in stocks would go in to Schwab Total Stock Market index with a .03% ER

25% for an international fund - 2 choices here:

Oppenheimer Developing Market Fund - 1.07% ER - 10 year return is 7.48%

MFS International Diversification Fund I  .94 gross ER .91 Net ER
10 year return is 7.35%

20% of funds in Bonds, choices are:

Federated Institutional High Yield Bond Fund - ER .58%/.50% 10yr yield 8.92%

Neuberger Berman Strat Income fund Ins ER .63%/69%  10 year return 6.53%

Brandywine Global Opp Fund ER .69%  10 year yield 5.24%

I am inclined to put 20% into the high yield bond fund, 25% into MFS international diversification fund, and 55% into Schwab Total Market Index.

If you would choose different funds, or change allocation in order to avoid one of these classes altogether  - would you please let me know what you think, and why?

personalfinance,Received money back from mortgage company due to escrow overage,"I received around $11,000 back from our mortgage company after their annual escrow review. We've had our house for 1 year now. My wife and I just have had our first baby and I was debating between putting this money towards the principal on our mortgage or putting into a Vanguard index fund and letting it ride until he's in college. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently maxing out my 403 (b) from my employer (they don't match sadly but I can get a pension from our union after I'm vested). My wife just started a new job but can get a 401(k) through her employer.

Monthly payment amount $2,966.17

Original loan amount$347,200.00

Original maturity date10/01/2032

&amp;#x200B;

Our original payments were $3,800 a month. If we put this money into the principal and kept at the $3800 a month payments putting extra into principal, we would finish our mortgage in 10 years. This would give us a good 8 years to save up for college.

personalfinance,A car might ruin my financial life?,"Hey Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start by saying I should've come here sooner, and I've already made several mistakes during this situation. I definitely appreciate feedback on what I could've done better, but also practical steps to take now to improve my current circumstances. r/personalfinance is a great sub, and thank you for your patience!

My shortest rundown:

18 months ago, the transmission of a 2001 car given to me was knocked out. I sold it for parts and bought a used 2015 Kia Soul w/ 45k on it for approx $15,000 from a dealership. (insert Kia joke here)

I drive 400 miles a week to commute, so I was done with the warranty in no time. Additionally, about 10 months ago I paid $2k to replace the Soul's compressor, but besides this major unexpected repair I was overall happy with the car.

&amp;#x200B;

Tuesday, Oct 2nd this month, the engine starts to click at low RPM's. I decide to wait till the weekend to address it. Thursday Oct 4th, I lose speed on the interstate, falling from 75 to 60, and the clicking triples in volume and frequency. I finish the last 5 miles to work, and  later bring it to Shop #1. 

Shop #1 says “Internal engine damage, buddy. $4k for a used engine with 45k on it. Too much trouble to take it apart to find the exact problem.”

&amp;#x200B;

In my head, I say hell no – there's a Kia dealership a mile away. Surely they can diagnose the issue better.

&amp;#x200B;

The Soul is towed to the dealership, and I receive the exact same diagnoses. “Internal engine damage. It'll cost $2k to open it up to find out what's wrong. A new engine will be anywhere from 5-8+k.”

Even after pushing and multiple meetings and phone calls, we could get no more detail on what could've possibly failed with the car. “Maybe a rod?”

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why I post: I owe $10,000 on this car. I paid off $5k in 18 months (but I also drove it an additional 45k, so now it's at 93ish. I drive a lot.)

&amp;#x200B;

Sinking in $5-8k on a car with almost 100k miles and no warranty that is only worth 4k at best?

&amp;#x200B;

I allowed myself to be convinced to buy a new car. The Soul was traded in for $500 and I ended up with a Dodge Journey for $19k, plus my warranty, and of course plus my original $10k in the hole means I now have a $35k car note, with a 7% interest rate due to my small credit history (I'm 26). It's a gas guzzler. 35k note on a car maybe worth $19k....

This is a monthly payment of at least $650. My insurance is $230 a month (Geico) so that's $880 a month on just car.

I am a public school teacher and earn $43k a year, paid twice a month.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,How do fixed interest rate student loans work?,"Hi, I have 4 student loans with Sallie Mae that I cannot consolidate into a government payment plan because I guess they are private (I didn't know this when I first got them, but that is beside the point). That aside, my first 2 loans with them I got at a high fixed interest rate of 9.75% and 10.75% each. After learning a little more and kind of figuring how things work as I got older (but before realizing you can't consolidate these Sallie Mae loans) I pretty much fought for my rates with the adjuster over the phone for the next 2 years and got non-fixed rates at 4.5% and 6%.                                        



The 4.5% and 6% rates have increased about 1% each over time to 5.5 and 7% currently, which I guess is expected because I chose non-fixed rates for these (still less than what the fixed rates would have been). However recently my fixed rate loans have also risen to 10% and 11%.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this legal? I thought getting a fixed rate loan meant the rate was pretty much unchangeable unless there was something I didn't understand/read in the fine print. Assuming it is not okay, how should I deal with this and what should I expect? I tried scouring around online for this information, but I can't really find it behind the mounds of student loan and debt ads and articles that aren't what I'm looking for, so I figured maybe someone from PF would know.

__________________________________

In this post, I want to address the Circulating Supply, the inflation mechanics and how the SDF is at best operating unethically towards it's users and at worst making false statements about the circulating supply of XLM.

**How does inflation on Stellar work?**

Each address can vote for another address. The voted for address needs ~50+ million votes to receive their share of the 1% yearly inflation (newly generated XLM). In case of the community inflation address, the XLM received is distributed back to the voters proportionally. The inflation is paid out weekly. Mods of r/Stellar (namely u/b1tcc) either don't understand or try to misguide the users in believing that no account can receive more than the 1% yearly. They say that if less addresses vote for the inflation, the overall inflation will be lower too. This is simply wrong. [The official definition](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/inflation.html):

&gt; - Calculate the inflation pool by (number of lumens in existence)*(weekly inflation rate) + fee pool.

Note: lumens in existence not lumens in circulating supply

&gt; - Tally the votes for each account based on the inflation destination set for every account.

Simplified: Total count of votes for each account make up the 100% the 1% will be distributed to.

&gt; - Determine which accounts exceeded the MIN_VOTE. These accounts are the winners.

If there are 1000 XLM and one has 200 voting for him, another has 300 and the rest didn't vote or didn't get enough votes, then one will receive 40% and the other 60% of the overall inflation. The other 500 possible votes are simply not counted anymore in this step.

&gt; - The winners each get their prorata share of the inflation pool, if their account can receive that amount of lumens and still satisfy its lumen buying liabilities. Otherwise, the winner receives the maximum amount of lumens that it can receive while still satisfying its lumen buying liabilities, with the rest of their prorata share returned to the fee pool. For example, if a winner gets 2% of the votes, it will get 2% of the inflation pool assuming the account can receive that amount.

This is pretty straightforward and directly addresses the lie spread by r/stellar mod u/b1tcc that no account can receive more than 1% inflation. In fact, if there was only one account that has enough votes (50+ million) it would receive the whole inflation for all existing lumens (which is ~1 Billion per year at the moment).
______________

Now when going to coinmarketcap or other aggregators, we see that the circulating supply of XLM is ~19 billion XLM. [This is a number reported by Stellar itself.](https://dashboard.stellar.org/) The SDF holds 85 Billion XLM of the 104 Billion overall supply but claims that only 8.65 Billion have been distributed (and doesn't mention what the remaining 10 Billion XLM are considered as).

The question is how **non circulating XLM** can participate in the voting mechanism of Stellar. My understanding is that only circulating supply is 'activated' supply and the rest is 'as if not existent'. However, the SDF and plenty of unidentified sub-accounts in the multi-millions and billions are voting for the SDF Inflation, receiving by far the biggest chunk of XLM inflation with 20,000,000+ XLM every week (and selling big parts of that off on various exchanges).

The SDF enriches itself with 20,000,000 XLM every week (that's a cool billion or 1,000,000,000 XLM per year) by voting for itself with XLM that is not even reported as circulating supply. If you are voting for the community pool, your weekly payout would be more than **50 times higher** if the SDF stopped receiving XLM to suppress the XLM price on exchanges by selling it off.

Ever wondered why there are not more programs to fuel adoption by using giveaways as it was announced over and over? The answer is simple: If the SDF gave XLM to people, they couldn't use those XLM anymore to vote for itself.

The biggest question is: if the SDFs mission is to fuel adoption of XLM, why don't they use the simplest tool of them all and stop claiming inflation to enrich themselves even more? The payout for lumenauts would be significantly higher if the whole inflation was paid to those holding XLM instead of to the SDF which would be a great incentive to buy and hold XLM. Not selling off inflation XLM on exchanges would help keeping the price stable or rising. It's a no-brainer to me and I consider this highly unethical by the SDF.
________________________

This thread is not covering the dodgy address generation by the SDF in the hundred thousands and movements of hundreds of millions of XLM between accounts, merging of accounts, sending hundreds of millions of XLM to uncounted of different accounts on various exchanges etcpp.

You can read a little about that [here](https://np.reddit.com/user/MrDrool/comments/9lvusj/another_repost_deleted_from_rstellar_about/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/user/MrDrool/comments/9kasv0/deleted_from_rstellar_plain_facts/) but it's not as well explained as in this thread.

This is also not covering Interstellar (Lightyear/Chain) which is a rabbit hole on it's own that runs deep. If you are into this kind of stuff, try to find their official funding and how they are running their operations or the $500,000,000 acquisition of Chain Inc (hint: they don't, the SDF does that).

My own opinion is that the SDF is basically a perpetual money machine just like the FED with a built in inflation of 1% that benefits the SDF not the actual users of Stellar. The SDF seems to be handled like a slushfund for certain persons that use the XLM as they please while poorly trying to cover their tracks. You can read how 209 million XLM moved from SDF Inflation to Bittrex on one of the links posted above.


I'm posting this here because I'm banned/moderated on r/stellar as well as a long term stellar application developer that voiced his opinion. I also would like to note that I received several PMs from known stellar developers that are not voicing their opinion in the open probably because they fear not to receive stellar grants in the future. I believe this information needs to be out in the open and to be addressed by the SDF.

We've been promised transparency since 4+ years and nothing happens. I ask for a complete list of SDF controlled stellar accounts and their purpose. I ask to identify major account holders (such as Stripe, Interstellar etc) that received significant grants from the SDF. I ask the justification for Lightyear to receive a grant of 5,000,000,000 XLM (this is an unconfirmed guess) with nothing to show for at the time. I ask the SDF to stop claiming inflation for the better of the community holding XLM. I ask the SDF to publicize how much inflation they received, how much and when that was sold off on exchanges and how much they profited off of that on the back of their community.


Believe me, I have a shitload of more questions and ten thousands of transactions and accounts I have questions to. I want answers.

To be continued...

# Edit: the downvote-force of 'believers' is in full force. Please don't let this slip under the table. If you own XLM yourself, you should want this answered yourself. I hold more than 70,000 XLM myself. This is not to discredit Stellar as a project but to get answers to questions that went censored and unanswered on r/stellar for weeks now.

# Edit2: After being ghosted for a while, I have now officially been banned from r/Stellar with no specific reason mentioned. Will this make it go away now or provoke more to come out?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Need advice on a money trap car,"Hello everyone, first time poster long time lurker. So I have have a money trap of a car and some advice on what to do with it would be greatly appreciated. I financed a 2011 VW GTI with 120,000 miles on it almost two years ago for around 10,000 (yes I realize now I got suckered) the finance sold me on a $3,000 warranty, which surprise I never used once. At the time of purchase I have almost no credit so I have around a 6% interest rate making my payments around $275 (which is perfectly manageable) a month on a 54 month lease meaning I'll have it paid off in June of 2021!

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Last summer my girlfriend and I had to move about 35 miles away from were she was going to school for family reasons and as her only means of transportation I had to keep my job in the college town and work while she went to school. This daily commute wasn't bad on the car but it got worse when I got a job as a pizza delivery driver. On top of the daily commute I was putting an additional 60-70 miles + on the car a day. Because of the extra wear and tear (and a lot of bad luck) on this VW, this years I have gotten 6 new tires, been in the shop 4 times, and on top of regular maintenance I have spent around $3500 on this car just this year alone, pretty much what the car is worth and I am so tired of it.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

As of writing this I still owe $8,295 on the car but I have a payment coming up next week. Most of these repairs I have paid out of pocket but some I have had to put on the credit card and have wracked up almost $2000 in debt just because of the car, you see my problem. It is so mentally and physically exhausting maintaining this car and I feel myself just spiraling down into further debt. This car is a money trap but I know if I trade it the difference of the lease will just be added to what I buy next (around $5000 difference). Somethings I already know, whatever car I get next I'll get on a 36 month lease and finance through my local credit union. I guess my question is, what should I do?  My initial thought was just keep making payments until the balance of the loan is equal to the value of the car and trade it in but that will be about another years and I don't know if I can keep affording to repair it for another year. Or do I just trade it in now and eat that extra $5000. Any help would be greatly appreciated and sorry for the wall of text.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Owe about $8000 on a car that has cost me $3500 just this year to maintain and its dragging me further into debt. Help.

Edit: for everyone asking, the warranty stated that it was in effect for either 3 years or after I have driven 36,000 miles. The problems with the car started happening right after I crossed that 36,000 mark.",finance

personalfinance,First time home-buyer with questions about where to start (Illinois).,"Beginning to look for a home for my fiance and I. 

Background: Our finances are currently separate and we would prefer that they stay that way for the time being, but are open to combining aspects of it if it benefits this process. I make about $60k annually, he makes about $30k. Currently live with our parents and are able to save up fairly quick. Currently have $7.5k in savings (just recently began saving). My credit score is 740, his is in the 800's. Looking to buy a duplex/condo in the $150k-$180k range. Ideally wanting to buy sooner rather than later (living apart and with parents), but realistically looking at spring/ early summer. 

I am honestly at a loss for where to start. My main question revolves around first time homeowners assistance in Illinois. I have been looking into the the IDHAccess loans and the 1st Home Illinois program and am not sure what the best option for us would be. We are planning to stay in the home for at least 5 years, so 1st Home Illinois would be an option (also looking within the eligible counties). The only one I am currently ruling out is the IHDAccess forgivable because it seems to be the least beneficial to us. With the deferred and repayable options, I have no idea which would be better in our situation. Would it be more beneficial to have the repayable with the extra cash up front for down payment, or to have less for the down payment but more cash throughout the month? Also, they say that you pay 1% of the cost of the down payment, but would that increase the monthly mortgage drastically? Or are the lower interest rates low enough to help offset this? 

Also, since we won't be married for a few more years yet, would it be better for me to purchase the house myself (I've read enough horror stories here) and have him as a renter? Or is the benefit of the extra income and his great credit score greater than the possibility that something were to go wrong in our relationship and one of us gets screwed? (And that's not to say I think either one of us would ever do that, nor do I think we would break up, but still).

Last, what kind of professional would be best to be able to meet up with and plan for this in person? I feel like I would greatly benefit from a meeting that could realistically lay every thing out on the table for me, but don't know who that would be.

personalfinance,I need help not squandering my inheritance.,"So, long story short, after a long battle with declining health, my great Uncle decided it was his time to go at 93. He went off life-saving blood transfusions, and passed away a few weeks ago. 

I was never super close to him (which I regret), so when I found out he decided to split his inheritance 10-ways to everyone instead of 4 ways to only his nieces and nephews (he had no children of his own), I was a bit shocked. My mom let me know that I’m looking at upwards of $40k (I was driving when I was told and almost crashed my car).

I have a Roth IRA with a little over $1000 put away, and I have a Morgan Stanley account with ~$35k invested at this time. 

**My current plan is as follows:**

Assuming a flat $40k (I’ve been told it’s more, but I’ll just adjust the plan to fit the actual value), I’m going to split it in half, and set the first $20k aside. After that, I’m going to take the second $20k, and split it again, leaving $10k in my personal savings account (which will be for emergencies and the short-term goal of moving in with my girlfriend some time in the next two years). With the last $10k, I’m going to put $5k in my IRA and invest the other $5k.

**The question remains though, what to do with the first half I set aside (the assumed $20k)?** What I want is to put it aside in a way where it will only grow and I physically cannot access it for at the very least 10 years (I’m 27 and still don’t feel responsible enough if I have the ability to use that money). 

I was thinking of putting it into a CD, but my father is telling me to invest it, as CDs have a poor interest rate at this time. However, like I said, I want to take the least risks with this chunk of the money, and don’t want to chance it shrinking, and while the reward is high with investing it, it is riskier than I’m comfortable with. 

What do you think is the best idea, and do you think my overall plan is solid? What advice can you give me, or what changes would you make to my current gameplan? I’ve never been fantastic with money, and ultimately I want to honor my Great Uncle by not squandering the last gift he gave me.",finance

personalfinance,Saved downpayment for RE: Go now and borrow rest or wait for crash that some people talk about when prices are now all time highs. Inflation and government printing money scares me.,"I reside in NY and am looking to invest in some real estate and I am looking for the wonderful reddit community's advice.

I have a downpayment saved and am planning to invest in some RE (as investment, not as primary residence) but I keep hearing that a crash may be coming. The fact that RE in NY shot up so much in price the recent years also makes it sort of scary.

Should I find something while interest rates are low or wait it out some more? I hear horror stories of people waiting it out when it used to be all time price highs and now they are full of regret as it is now even higher.

Opinions and thoughts much appreciated. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Is personal finance advice to US specific? Ho,"Hi guys,

I'm in desperate need of your 2 cents on how to cope with inflation in the low interest rate savings environment in Europe. I listened to the podcasts, read the posts and watched the videos, but I feel all *Finance content is super US focused*, where investment opportunities are much broader and more competitively priced. In other words,  I can only dream at the Risk-free returns people claim are low in the US.

I am based in Bucharest, but working for a long-term project in the Netherlands. I manage to put aside a good chunk of my income (40%), but I see it dwindling in real terms, despite using many of the techniques typically advertised by Personal Finance ""gurus"". 

All being said, h**ow do you increase your portfolio return over the 0.1 - 1% in the savings account?** Which techniques/banks/ investment vehicles do you use? **How would you advise me to move forward?**

Perhaps, more importantly, which  Europe specific resources would you recommend me reading?

I plan on purchasing an investment property as housing prices seemed to have peaked in Bucharest. A 15 year mortgage is what I aim for.

CryptoCurrency,Top Five Cryptocurrency News Stories of the Weekend in Five Sentences or Less (10/15/2018),"**Around the Block** is a daily crypto news update sent directly to your phone.  We breakdown the top five stories in five sentences or less. No BS. No Bias. [https://aroundtheblock.news/](https://aroundtheblock.news/)  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_   


**1) Nouriel Roubini and Vitalik face-off: debate coming soon?**

Following Roubini’s accusations and Twitter tirade against Vitalik Buterin, he posted that he would be “happy to have a live debate the Ethereum founder,” on the condition that they both agree on a moderator who should not be a “biased shill,” and specifically not Forbes contributor Laura Shin. Buterin responded, nominating Kevin Pham: “Can’t get more fair than someone equally 100% biased against both of us!”  


**2) Tether trouble: millions of USDT exit Bitfinex, stablecoin falls below $0.90**

Bitfinex had a rough week: a pseudonymous author claimed they were “insolvent,” millions of tethers (USDT) were seen exiting Bitfinex, fiat deposits and withdrawals were frozen, and the trade value of USDT fell below 90 cents. The value of USDT has been stabilizing since and the exchange has released a blog post denying the insolvency rumours claimed in a Medium post that has since been taken down.

“Bitfinex is not insolvent, and a constant stream of Medium articles claiming otherwise is not going to change this,” they wrote. As for the fiat freeze, they said there are still complications but they are doing their best to minimize waiting times.  


**3) SEC comes after another ICO, which falsely claimed it had SEC approval**

In a release, the SEC said it “has obtained an emergency court order halting a planned initial coin offering,” as well as any ongoing pre-ICO sales by a company called Blockvest, which created the token BLV. According to the release, the company falsely claimed to be approved by the SEC.

“Blockvest and Ringgold, who also goes by the name Rasool Abdul Rahim El, were using the SEC seal without permission, a violation of federal law, and falsely claiming their crypto fund was ‘licensed and regulated.’ The complaint also alleges Ringgold promoted the ICO with a fake agency he created called the ‘Blockchain Exchange Commission,’ using a graphic similar to the SEC’s seal and the same address as SEC headquarters.”  


**4) LTC founder Charlie Lee interested in Monero, may “eventually have to step away from Litecoin”**

In an interview with cryptocurrency prime dealer SFOX, Litecoin founder Charlie Lee said: “Bitcoin is obviously the soundest form of money around, and Litecoin, I would say, is the second soundest. Another project that I’m interested in as Monero: I think a bit of privacy and fungibility is something that’s missing from Bitcoin and Litecoin, and it’s very much needed.”

“Obviously, Litecoin is more centralized than Bitcoin. If anyone wants to target Litecoin, they could attack me. That’s something that definitely could be improved. So I think that moving forward, I’ll eventually have to step away from Litecoin”.  


**5) Confirmed: Coinbase’s crypto index fund is closing down**

A Coinbase spokesperson has reportedly confirmed that the cryptocurrency exchange is shutting down the Coinbase Index Fund by the end of October, four months since it went live, according to a CoinDesk article.

“After assessing demand from retail, accredited and institutional investors, Coinbase has decided to shut down Coinbase Index Fund. We will focus on providing diversified exposure to all investors through Coinbase Bundle,” the spokesperson said",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Car Loan - How would refinancing work?,"I got a 2017 Hyundai Sonata Sport in July due to my car starting to fall apart. I decided to trade in my 2010 Ford Fusion (needed a radiator, A/C wasnt working despite hundreds of dollars in repairs... multiple times, etc.) 


The loan amount, according to the bank website, was $21,408 (I also got a warranty that's built into my monthly payments, so keep that in mind) at a rate of 6.89% for 84 months. I wasnt too happy with the interest, as I have ""great"" credit, but the finance manager suggested I just refinance and there shouldn't be a penalty since I am in NY.


The credit union I want to use to refinance is the one the last dealership I used for financing. I think my interest rate was 3.84% or something. When I called them to inquire a month ago they said my current rate seems too high and to call back when I am ready to refinance. 


So now I am ready. But I am unsure what the process is or how it works. They cut me a check for the loan amount and I pay it off with the first bank? Was the interest from the first loan added in immediately or is it annually?


I wasnt expecting to get the car quickly, but the vehicle had the lowest mileage I had seen on cars.com and other sites for car buying. At the time I did use KBB and it was a good purchase price, although the taxes alone basically wiped out my trade in value.

personalfinance,"Inherited Annuities, unsure how to properly invest, getting mixed advice","Note: TLDR at the bottom 

I've read multiple posts on this sub already related to this similar issue, but feel like I need a little more guidance tailored specifically to my situation since I'm feeling very lost as to the best way to handle this. 

For additional reference, I'm 25 and I'm currently in the 24% income bracket, and live in California (high cost of living). 

Long story short I inherited 3 annuities recently, each valued around 100k. Each cost basis is about 45k of their total value. The first thing I did was try to find a local tax/financial advisor, per the annuity company's suggestion and from family suggestion. The advisor I found has so far seemed very knowledgeable and helpful in providing different tax scenarios based on what I do with each one (lump sum/5 year payout/keep or transfer as annuity). However, when I talked to him about not being sure what to do with the money, he suggested keeping one of the three in an annuity, possibly transferring it to a ""better"" annuity with more growth potential (0-12% annual) than the current one (3.5% fixed). It looked good on paper and sounded like a good way to invest at least one of these things in a safe conservative way, but everything I see on reddit about annuities is to stay away from them. 

Here's where I start getting lost. I'm concerned about trying to avoid paying as much tax on these as possible. Since tax rates have come down recently, it seems like it could potentially be a good time to just do lump sum or 5 year payout for these, but I don't know how to invest them properly if I did that. I'm also concerned about what to do with the money. I know nothing about investing properly. Plus, lately the market seems fairly unstable and it definitely seems we're due for a recession or extreme correction soon (not including the correction going on right now). So I'm also worried about investing in anything market related until it becomes more settled. I've read about IRA's, but max contribution on those is only $5500/year right? 

I realize I started rambling there but I figure the more info on it all and how I'm weighing things helps guide what I should do. Any help is appreciated, I'm super lost and based on my most recent meeting with my tax/financial advisor I'm very uncertain on what the right thing to do is. He wants to try to move forward with this annuity thing at our next meeting unless I tell him otherwise beforehand, so I need to figure out some real answers ASAP. :(

TL;DR: Inherited 3 annuities, don't know what to do with them. Considering doing lump sum or 5 year payout on 1 or 2 of them, but worried about if I would end up paying more tax that way than some alternative option. Tax advisor is suggesting to keep one in an annuity and transfer to one with potentially better interest rate. Don't feel certain about that because I've read on this subreddit that annuities are scams for people in their 20's like me. Need guidance on what to do.

Summary of info:
- 25, California, 24% income bracket
- The 3 annuities total to over 300k, with total cost basis at around 130k
- Must decide by end of next year, am allowed to lump sum or start payout of one or two this year, and then do other(s) next year, to help with avoiding tax

Thanks so much to anyone who helps!",finance
personalfinance,Tax on first paycheck seems rather high.,"Hello,  first time poster on this sub. I apologize if I make a faux pas. I did review the rules before posting as well. 


Anyway, my wife and I just moved to Florida because she got a new job right out of grad school which was really the job she most wanted. She was offerend in her formal offer letter a position making $48,000 a year. She just recently got her first paycheck and here's the breakdown:


She's paid bi-weekly. Also, the pay stub says she is being compensated for 80 hours over a 2 week period at a rate of $23.195402 an hour. So we know the amount listed is the intended amount she is expected to be paid bi-weekly (that is to say she's wasn't paid for a week and a half due to her start date or anything. It was a full 80 hours). 


She made $1,855.63 on this first paycheck. 

Fica alternative taken out (not taxed): $139.17


So after that we have $1,716.46 taxable income. 

We live in Florida so no state income tax

Federal: $456.71

Medicare: $26.91


So we end up with $1,232.84 for this paycheck


When I run the numbers I get that they taxed her 28% of her income. Now I knew she would probably jump up a tax bracket with this new job, but I thought it would be more like 22% at worst. She filed as married and filed 2 allowances (herself and I). 


Am I missing something or is 28% of her income what we should expect. I'm just wondering because, in the past, when I've had jobs with similar hourly rate I don't think (don't remember?) being taxed so highly. It seems for every $23 she makes she can expect to see roughly $16.50 and that just seems... off to me. Again, maybe I'm wrong and need to become a more financially aware person. If anyone can give me some insight that would be really appreciated. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,401k Withdrawal - Tax Advice,"Throwaway account.

Background: My wife and I have a high income, but due to some previous medical issues, as well as selling a house at a large loss a few years ago, we're not as liquid as we'd like to be.  We are relocating in the coming month, back to an area where we used to live, and don't want to put off purchasing a new home for another year.  We have a fairly large amount of money set aside for a down payment, though need to pull about $15k (net) out of one of my 401k accounts.  I have about $185k in my 401k accounts, and while I know /r/personalfinance is going to frown upon raiding retirement funds for purchasing basically anything, I don't have another choice.

Pertinent Information: 2018 gross income will be approximately $265,000.  Currently live in Florida, with no state income tax.

Question: The federal tax income bracket for taxpayers that are Married, Filing Jointly, with gross income between $165,001 and $315,000 is 24%.  The next bracket is $400,001 to $600,000, at 32%.  When I request the disbursement, which will keep us in the lower tax bracket, should I specify withholding at 24%, or should I use 32% to be safe?

Edited to add: Please folks, I'm not looking for editorializing on what *I* should do with *MY* money.  All I'm asking for is a little tax advice.  The withdrawal is happening, I just need to know whether to withhold at 24% or 32%.",finance
personalfinance,Secured Personal Loan to Build Credit Mix,"Hi all. I did some browsing and couldn't find any advice on reddit specifically tailored to this, so I'll ask away.

I'm looking to build my credit mix and add in an installment loan, while having a ~670 FICO score. I'm not looking to pay the %10-20 interest rates on an unsecured personal loan, and I have funds available to set aside. I also have no intent of a major purchase (such as an auto or home loan) in the next year or two. I don't have any installment loans on my credit history.

My credit union quoted a %3.1 interest rate over the duration of a 1-2 year secured personal loan with ranges from $250-$10000. I have a few questions and thoughts I'd like clarification on:

1. The value of the debt is not a factor in the building of credit. Correct? so if I take out a $1000 installment loan it is no different than a $10,000 if the terms are the same.
2. Would a longer duration on the loan be more beneficial to my credit history?
3. Does this installment loan only affect my credit score while it's active/will I lose the benefits of having an installment loan on my credit score once it's paid off?
4. If something random happens to the real estate market or my job and I find myself able and desiring a home loan, would this installment loan be detrimental to have on my credit report if still active?
5. My banker offered multiple smaller secured personal loans in order ""add more total credit accounts"" to my report. Would this help me? I currently have 4 active credit accounts, which are all credit cards that I keep under %10 utilization. 

Happy to offer any clarification of my personal financial standing if needed. Thanks!",finance

investing,Robinhood Gets Almost Half Its Revenue in Controversial Bargain With High-Speed Traders,"Article strongly comes off as a hit piece, but fwiw:

""...
The startup, valued at $5.6 billion, was bringing in more than 40 percent of its revenue earlier this year from selling its customers’ orders to high-frequency trading firms, or market makers, like Citadel Securities and Two Sigma Securities, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Almost all retail brokerages employ the practice, called payment for order flow, but it’s an unlikely strategy for a company built on an anti-Wall Street message.

...

Here's how it works: Retail brokers like Robinhood focus on recruiting customers and building the trading interface, but don't actually execute their clients' orders. They outsource that to firms—including Citadel, Two Sigma and Wolverine Securities—that pay for the right to handle those trades. While orders from large, sophisticated investors can burn the market maker who executes the trade, retail trades are considered relatively safe.

These firms earn a tiny bit of money off each transaction, often 1 cent or less per share. Some see payment for order flow as a critical piece of market infrastructure—facilitating the fast and cheap buying and selling of stocks. But critics of high-frequency trading have long argued that the practice actually hurts the little guy, to the advantage of large firms.

Federal rules dictate that brokers must seek the best execution for clients’ trades, but finding the best price possible is not necessarily a requirement. Consumer advocates say the system creates an incentive for brokers to route orders to the market maker that pays the most.

During last year’s fourth quarter, regulatory disclosures indicated that Robinhood shipped virtually all of its orders for stock trades to four high-speed market makers. The bulk was bought by Citadel, which paid Robinhood an average of “less than $0.0024 per share"" on the trades it was routed in that quarter. Those small numbers add up—Robinhood’s users have executed more than $150 billion in transactions.

...

But regulators have scrutinized both brokers and market makers over rebates in recent years. TD Ameritrade, for example, faces a class-action lawsuit alleging its use of the payment-for-order-flow system is unfair. The company said it disagreed and would appeal. 

Whatever the impact on consumers, some believe payments for order flow may not be a sustainable revenue source for Robinhood, thanks to regulatory pressures and consumer ire. ""Robinhood's revenue model could easily disappear,"" said Tyler Gellasch, executive director of Healthy Markets, an investor advocacy group. ""They've made it clear that they are comfortable living on this regulatory edge.""

personalfinance,Car Accident Total Loss Payout - New Car or Pay Down Debt?,"*Longtime lurker, first time post, yada yada yada. 
Finally created an account just to post this. I apologize mods, but as reddit virgin I have no idea how to add Auto and Debt flair to this post*

So, had a terrible accident two weeks ago. Injuries to both myself and someone else. I'll play it safe since it will go to court for both tickets and liability and not describe everything that happened. But the end result is **total loss on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler** on my side, as well as broken bones. This was while preparing to buy my wife her first new car ever before the accident occured. Jeep was paid off.

So now I am trying to reconfigure and assess the best way to approach this. We have 3 factors in play;
&amp;nbsp;
---

| Wife New Car   | Me New Car    | Existing Debt     |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Hyundai Elantra        |          Jeep Wrangler Rubicon|     Credit Cards     
| $17,200 out the door  |    $38,000 out the door|  $15,000   
| Assumed interest rate: 6.5%      |        Assumed Interest Rate: 3.69%|   Interest Rate: 23% 
&amp;nbsp;

---   

What I am trying to figure out is the order to address these. **Assuming I take a total loss on the Wrangler and take a $17,500 check** (rounded).

My proposed course of action (in order) is as follows:

1. Buy wife new car. She has terrible credit (below 550) and I will co-sign, hence the higher estimated interest rate. Finance $12,500 after down payment for a 60 month term. She will make monthly payment from her paycheck, but my credit is needed to secure loan (For reference, my credit is above 740)
&amp;nbsp;
2. Me Pay Down Debt. I am proposing applying $15,000 of the total loss payout to my credit card debt at 23% interest to wipe it out. Take the remaining $2,500 and let it ride in my CapitalOne 360 Account. *Now the hard part of this plan. Wait till the new year for step 3 by driving my wifes old car that likes to stall out with no AC. Save what I can while doing so*
&amp;nbsp;
3. Finance new Jeep Wrangler under only my credit in the new year. Apply what I've saved plus leftover total loss payout as down payment and custom order a new Jeep. Assume finance $33,000 at 3.69% for 60 months.
&amp;nbsp;

It's hard losing a car you paid off in half it's finance term, but it's gone. So now it's time to make the right moves instead of the convenient ones.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

The following limitations led me here:
&amp;nbsp;

- Due to asthma my wife can no longer drive her clunker. Its got mold with no AC to remove moisture. We are bleeding money rental a car weekly for $120 average (But hey, wracking up miles!). Otherwise I would swap out steps 1 and 2 to improve my credit with the payout first

- Once the clunker goes back into daily use, I will at **best** get 4 months out of it before the drive train issue badly surface from daily use. So it gets me as far as January.

personalfinance,Buying a car with bad credit but have tons for down payment. Questions about my idea.,"So long story short, I have a credit score of around 500. My car got totaled by a drunk driver while it was parked outside my apartment. My insurance paid it off and I got a check for $600. Now, I have a 401k with the company I work for. You can take loans out at a 5% interest rate, and that interest literally just goes right back into your 401k. I’ve used it a couple times before for like unexpected car repairs and random big stuff like that. Take out a 12 month loan for $1500, it’s paid off directly out of your paycheck for 12 months.

So. Last car I bought I needed like $2500 down on. It was a $12k car. The interest rate was like 21%. This means my new loan is gonna be probably around 21% for my new car. Whatever, I deserve it cause I have bad credit.

Question is, if I go to buy a 18k car, would you guys recommend putting whatever down payment I need and then having the rest on that 21% interest loan, OR do I throw like a 10k loan from my 401k towards it as a down payment thereby placing a huge chunk of the car’s price on a much lower interest rate loan where I actually make that interest back?

personalfinance,Taxable account vs focusing on 401k/TSP?,"Hi, 

So a bit about myself: I'm 30, married, currently have 2 mortgages, 15k in our bank account, 75k in our savings account earning 1.8% interest. I've maxed out my TSP (federal employee version of the 401k) for this year and looking to know what I should do.

* We rent one house currently and earn about $200-$300 a month in profit. Though this year will be a wash it seems due to repairs.
* We've only been meeting the match for my spouses 401k as they give minimal and we thought it would be better to focus on my TSP since it has lower fees.
* We maxed out my IRA this year not hers.

Is it dumb to put a large chunk of the 75k into a taxable account with Vanguard or Charles Schwab? We want to use the interest towards family vacations and stuff like that rather than having all our savings being untouchable until we're 65. I'd basically mirror the taxable account to what I have in my TSP.  We keep a large emergency fund. Easily 6 months of expenses I think. I'd also like to get more rental properties but my wife is mainly against it since we've had some slight headaches.

personalfinance,Transferring from a traditional bank to an online bank,"Due to the interest rates for online banks being significantly higher than tradition banks (brick and mortar), I plan on opening up a savings account at one of these online banks. From what I understand, the majority of the online banks are entirely online with no physical location meaning you have to transfer money into these accounts. There are two types of transfers: ACH and wire transfer.

**ACH**

* takes a few days
* has a small limit on the amount you can transfer
* sometimes has a fee (depending on the bank)

**Wire Transfers**

* takes about a day
* has a large limit on the amount you can transfer
* usually has a fee

Is there an alternative way to transfer money into an online bank savings account without paying a fee or being limited to a low amount? I don't mind waiting a few days.

While reviewing some of the online banks, I noticed an online bank (Citizens Access) that charges no fees for transfers, but they only allowed ACH, which means you can only transfer a small amount per day causing withdrawal to be a pain in the butt. What do you do to get around this? Not sure if other online banks are limited this way, too.",finance
personalfinance,"Balance Transfer Question, Partial transfer on very high interest card or 0 out card with reasonable interest?","I received an offer from my credit union Mastercard. They increased my credit limit, and are offering attractive terms on a balance transfer (no transfer fee, 4.99 APR on balance transfer for 18 months.) 

I have a Barclay Visa card with a very high interest rate and a large balance, and a CapitalOne card with a more reasonable rate and a lower balance. The increased limit on the CU card is not large enough to 0 the balance on the nasty card, but enough to 0 the more reasonable one.

Would it be more advantageous for my credit to make a partial transfer from the nasty card, (leaving half the balance) or 0 out the reasonable card?

I do use the reasonable card regularly for car-care expenses, the CU card was maxed earlier this year, but has recovered, the balance transfer would max it again. On both, I regularly pay more than the minimum. My credit rating is Fair, I would like to avoid applying for another CC account. (Temptation)

personalfinance,Spending too much on transportation,"I'm in high school and don't have a car. I'm applying to jobs that are too far away from my house to walk to... so I'd have to Uber at least to home (I might be able to take a bus there, but the routes end in mid-evening). 

I'd be spending $40-$60 on transportation a week for a minimum wage job. Although I hope that this can help maximize my hours to 30hr/week or so, I'm still worried that I'd be spending too much when I have other financial commitments as well. I'm responsible for my phone bill (~$45/mo) and sports fees (~$50-100/mo), and I also need to save up for college (I want/need $10-20k in the next 2 years... so far I have $0). 

If my math is right—which it probably isn't—then I'll have $700-ish each month left to put toward college. I'd be able to make my goal amount for college, but is it worth spending almost $3k/year on transportation for? 

Would it be smart to invest in a car for next year? Is having my own car cheaper than Ubers and buses (would it be less than $3k/mo)? The colleges I want to go to mostly don't allow freshmen to have cars on campus, so I'd eventually have to pay for off-campus parking lots. Some colleges don't let freshmen, sophomores, _and_ juniors to have cars on campus... so I'm not sure if the price is worth it. 

Important note: those earnings would be the _ideal situation_... I know that I'm unlikely to actually work 30hr/week since this would be my first job and transportation is so iffy. I.e. my earnings are probably going to be less, so the consequences of spending so much on transportation would be more pronounced (transportation expenses would be proportional to the amount of hours I work, but it'd be much less worth it if I were only making X amount instead of Y amount). 

Also - any other advice for me? I just opened a savings and checkings account independent of my parents (not a joint account) at 16. I plan on just keeping a little in my checking account so it's there when I need it, and then putting everything else in savings.

personalfinance,Need some advice on personal loans,"Personal Loans and Misc. Advice

So a little backstory. I am in the military and I separate December 9th. When I was first in I made plenty of typical young and brand new in the military financial mistakes, mostly opening credit cards. I also got a subaru Wrx 2016 in February of 2016 as a lease with an option to buy and planned on buying it when the lease ended which is coming up. Since I planned on buying it I did a few performance modifications to the car. Nothing too big and was always responsibly done with plenty of background research and tuning after installing parts that would require one. I racked up a considerable amount of credit card debt in the past few years as well (about 7k). 

Recently I have finally managed to reduce this debt to 0 and began saving some money while on a 6 month rotation. I've put away a couple  Thousand dollars as a buffer between when school starts and I receive my GI Bill benefits as well as getting a part time job.

Now just a few days from returning to the states, I get a phone call from a friend that I asked to take my car around the block once a week while I was gone. Long story short my engine has most likely blown and it will be around 6k to replace including parts and labor. 

So my issue is for 1 I don't even have the funds to fix it lol. And if I did have barely enough I wouldn't have any Money to buffer my transition from getting out of the military and into the job force/school. On top of this I was months away from getting a car loan to buy my car and end the lease in February. Should I

1. Use all the cash I have and pay the difference with credit cards

2. Use all the cash I have a take out a personal loan to pay the difference 

3. Keep my savings as that buffer and pay the. Majority of it with a personal loan

I'm honestly leaning towards option 3 just because I could potentially get an interest rate less than my credit cards and be able to have a little financial security for my transition. 

I start school January 7th and will be moving back in with my parents for the first 6 months to a year while I get used life outside of the military and getting back into the school rhythm. I'm originally from the bay area so the BAH checks I'll be getting every month while going to school will be about 4k. January 11th is my original separation date, but I'll be taking a little over a month of terminal leave. So that last month I'll also make a BAH check in addition to my normal pay.

personalfinance,"Need some assistance comparing 2 different Home loan types. ""Conditional 97"" with higher rate, but no PMI vs ""Conditional 95"" with lower rate but w/PMI"" Total payment each month is similar.","EDIT: Corrected some words. Also The Conventional 97 rate is 5.625%. FHA might be around standard rates thanks to amazing credit. 

Essentially I am curious if there is a basic rule of thumb about higher interest home loans like ~~Conditional~~ Conventional 97 where you have a higher interest rate, but no PMI. And the assumption is when you can afford it, you re-finance to get a lower rate.  

Vs other types of loans with a PMI. where the PMI can eventually be ""Paid off"" so to speak.  

I apologize for lack of details at the moment, but the point of this question is to see if there are any initial red flags with the basics.  

Are one fo you going to come out and say ""No NEVER do a ~~conditional~~ Conventional 97 it is a scam. No details required""  

Or are these both good ideas, each with pros and cons, and you guys need more details from me.  

Anyways to clarify. I have never heard of a home loan without a PMI. If you did not have a large enough down payment.  

Here is possibly a very important detail. My wife and i plan on paying off the home within 5-10 years anyways. So with a PMI we would have wiped it out in a few years. But with a Conventional 97 that higher rate would never go away without re-financing.  

Again i realize I did not provide a lot of info, but I am not sure where to begin in asking about these products. So i wanted to start with the basics and make sure there were no immediate red flags. And hope to obtain some further details as you ask questions, i will have better context for what info is needed and what questions i can ask.

First off, I am super new to refinancing and I think this would be the correct sub for this, but I have been wrong before.  My question is would it be beneficial to refinance if I am planning to sell in about 3-4 years.  My house got appraised for FHA loan at $65k (he did a crap job, probably worth closer to 75-80), and I have around $57k left on my mortgage.  Current interest rate is 6.25% and the new rate would be 4.5%.  I would not be getting cash out, and the new mortgage would cut my monthly payments by around $85.  I am just not sure if it is a good idea to take out 97.5% (apparently you can do that percentage with an FHA and no cash out) and it might lose value. I can live comfortably with the current mortgage payment but would like the extra money to go in my savings. Any suggestions are appreciated.

Debts:
My student loans: 320k federal
Her student loans: 200k federal, 30k private
0% APR CC (for another 14 months): 6k
Rent: 1300/mo

What is the best strategy now for repaying debt? We really wanted to wipe out her private loans, I don't like having credit card debt that I'm not paying off immediately, but I also feel like we need an emergency fund, and then also money for a cross country move.

I don't have any other major debts or loans, only my CC, which I keep under $1k.
My (perhaps erroneous) understanding of credit scores is that they're based on the number of credit accounts/loans you have open (the more, the better), the length of those (the older, the better), and how reliably you pay them off.
Based on that understanding, it seems that putting the $7k aside and continuing the monthly payments would be best for my score (yes, I know, interest rates).

I'm considering taking out a student loan to pay for rent, food and gas to put off the interest rates on my cards and save my current credit score. Paying off credit cards with a student loan is illegal so I figured I could use my disability and housing allowance to pay off my CCs. I know this sounds ridiculous and the solution is simple. Pay off the highest interest rate card first and so on.

personalfinance,When to pay back on very low interest rate loan,"I have a reasonably sized student loan of around $90k equivalent in Swedish money. The exact numbers aren't really that important here but its appreciate some advice how to handle it.

I have a 25 year term on this loan of which I'm 5 years in to it. I'm currently paying back a bit under $300/month so obviously not really making very much headway into paying it off. However, I'm currently not to worried since interest rate is linked to the central bank interest rate so it is currently 0.13%. I pay back 40x more than my interest payment which seems like a reasonable ratio. I'm currently treating it as a 0% interest loan whereby it makes little sense to pay it back. 

Ideally I'd want to pay this back quicker and I could quite easily double the payments. The situation with the -0.50% central bank interest rate won't stay forever but currently it makes sense to just put the money in to an index fund. If I could stop paying back altogether I would but at what point would you start to really pay back on this loan? When interest rate goes above inflation? When it goes above say 4%? Never to pay back more that I have to?

I would like to buy a house at some point in the not too distant future and I would need to put down a 15% cash deposit. The deposit is roughly the same amount as my student loan currently sits at. Paying back the student loan faster would push this date further out. A mortgage currently sits at 1.39% from most lenders and you need to pay back no more than 3% a year so no massive amounts of money here either.

Thanks PF!

personalfinance,Refinance or Pay off Car Loan??? - Asking for advice,"I recently got married and my wife took out a car loan for a used '13 Nissan Sentra back in 2014.  After looking into this loan now that we have combined finances, I realize that it is not a good loan whatsoever. 

The loan amount was  $14,550.92  with an interest of 13.07% APR over 73 months. 

The monthly payments are $294; the total paid as of today is $8,827, with $12,325 left to pay. 

If we were to pay off today, we would owe  $9,861.26.

My wife has a below average credit score (although it's building from on-time payments and no credit debt), and my credit score is well above average. 

My question is: Should we attempt to refinance this loan **or** pay it off in full today? I have enough assets to pay off the remaining balance, but if we can refinance for a much smaller interest rate and shorter loan term - maybe this would help continue to build her credit?

If you advise refinancing the loan, what would be the best institution to approach?

Bitcoin,Why the Fed's Real-time Payment System Will Fail,"Last Wednesday, the day the markets started to slide, there was a US Senate Banking hearing on crypto. If you didn't get a chance to see it I've included a link to the video below. [1]

About precisely 51 minutes in you'll hear Chris Van Hollen begin to discuss what he described as the Fed's desire to implement a ""real-time"" banking system because it could help people living ""paycheck-to-paycheck"". But that's wishful thinking no matter how well FinTech seems to work due to Shadow Banking, the dark underbelly of of the banking world which is so gross it the banking sector has tried to use MSM to change the name. Gross.

Anyway, I'm happy to report I just used crypto instead of a Chase wire transfer to move some of my greenbacks from the US and convert them into some pretty Rupiah cash money here in Bali, Indonesia and the results were surprising.

Here's what I did:

I put a limit order buy on GDAX and scooped up some BCH on a dip, sent it through two mobile burner wallets for less than a penny each, then put a limit sell at 1% above market on Indodax, then paid Rp30.000 (about $2) to withdraw the money straight to an Indonesian Bank.

And here's the result:

I saved a $40 Chase wire fee and about a week of waiting for SWIFT (that name though right?) to clear. I also ended up making about $11 dollars in the process from well-timed trades and had my money in a few hours.

So will FinTech help the Fed reach a real-time payment system so poor people can have more liquid access to their money as Dr. Roubini suggests in the video? I kindly doubt it...unless FinTech starts using Bitcoin.

personalfinance,W-4 Calculators? Which is right?,"I just got married (woo!), and now I'm working on updating the W-4's of my spouse and myself. I initially was using the [IRS W-4 withholdings calculator](https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/index2.jsp), but I found out that [Turbo Tax also has one](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/calculators/w4/).  I filled out both and have vastly different results.

The IRS calculator says that my spouse and I will owe money and need to have additional withholding for each paycheck to not owe money for 2018.  Turbo Tax says I'm getting a very hefty 'marriage bonus' (my term, not theirs) for my tax return next year.  Which should I trust?

They ask for slightly different information actually.

IRS asks for total contributions for 2018 to 401 (K)s, which we both have.

It also asks for your total contribution to pre-tax cafeteria plans (health, dental, vision, HSA).

Turbo Tax has you subtract the YTD contributions to 401(K) and pre-tax cafeteria plans from your gross pay YTD and labels that your ""Taxable Income"" YTD.It also similarly asks what your gross pay is per pay period minus those same pre-tax contributions, and calls that your ""taxable income per pay period.""

Turbo Tax does take into account state tax withholdings for the year in addition to what has been withheld for Federal Income tax so far.

Turbo Tax also takes into account that I currently file as Single, but will be designated Married, filing jointly.

&amp;#x200B;

It's worth noting that I'm moving down a tax bracket as a result of getting married; I do make a good bit more than my spouse, currently.

This doesn't leave much wiggle room for saving money or paying off debt. I have come up with a budget, and started tracking my spending to attempt to save some money and pay off my debt, but seeing that looming number is stressing me out a lot.  While looking in my companies HR/Finance portal, I saw an option to take a loan out against your 401k and I was thinking that it could be a possible solution. I am not too financially savy so I would love some insight. Right now on my credit cards, I have a 15% APR rate. I pay the minimum every month, but try to pay more whenever I have it. If I borrowed from my 401k  (I currently contribute 15% of each paycheck and have a decent chunk of money in) it would be a 6% interest rate, with a payment plan to pay back over the course of time. I feel like I would feel more  comfortable taking a loan out against my own money, that I will of course payback, and I will be able to track my payments to know exactly when it will be paid off.

I hope to have a fairly decent salary after I get my PhD, and I currently have a PhD stipend of $26k and have a revolving co-op with a pharmaceutical company that pays fairly well, and minimal other expenses besides a car payment, rent, food, etc.

Rent: 589

personalfinance,"I’m a 26 year old law student feeling suffocated by debt and terrified of the future. I don’t know what to do, I’m stressed and scared and I really need some help.","I am shaking while writing this, but I know that I need to suck it up and put it all out there. I've been struggling financially for the past few months and I am feeling so suffocated under all of this that I can't see a way out. I have been more stressed and anxious about this than anything else in my life. I could barely sleep last night, my heart beating out of my chest, knowing that I was going to type this post up and submit it today, asking for help/advice/suggestions/a way forward.

I feel so overwhelmed I don't even know where to begin.

First, some info about me: I am a 26 year old law student, in the middle of my final year of school. I go to school full-time, am a senior editor on the law school's law review, and I also work two part-time jobs (one is at Starbucks, the other is a legal internship for the federal government that limits me on how many hours I can work). I do about 12-18 hours at starbucks and only 4 hours with the government per week. On top of that, I am doing lots of post-graduation job searching, networking, applying, interviewing and other things to try and help me find decent-paying legal work after I graduate. I have little to no time formyself and It is *killing me*. I am stretched thin, tired, losing weight, struggling to keep up in school and on top of all this, I've always got money and my debt and my insufficient income to help me out on my mind. 

I've tried reading some self-help financial books, but a lot of them seem to be geared more towards people who are already pretty financially stable, who need advice investing or saving for retirement, etc. I can't even begin to think about that right now. It scares me, freaks me out, makes my heart rate speed up. I am terrified that I've fucked over my future, because of stupid decisions and irresponsibility.

When I graduate in the spring, I will have roughly $150,000 in student loans. That thought terrifies me. Currently, I have $17,931.87 in credit card debt. In late spring earlier this year, I opened a balance transfer card to send some of my debt over there, in the hopes of avoiding paying more interest on it. As you will see, that didn't come to fruition, and I've ended up gathering more debt since then...

This has all accumulated on top of my student loans for a number of reasons: cost of living increased much more than I expected, unexpected car troubles/emergencies hit me that I was unprepared for, and during both of my summers in between years of school, I was working away from home, unable to sub-let my apartment, and without student loans in the summer to help buoy me, was paying to live in a different city for work while also having to maintain my apartment at home. I ended up being unable to save anything from either of these two summer jobs, had to rely on credit cards to just pay rent/utilities/travel expenses/etc., and now, here I am. Drowning in debt, suffocating, feeling like there is no end in sight. I'm not trying to make excuses, I know I'm in a deep hole and I need some help to get out of it. 


I am terrified. I am feeling so lost and helpless and ashamed. I'm depressed and suffering mild anxiety attacks, which has never happened before. I never thought this would happen to me but I don't know what to do or where to turn or what to even *start* doing now to fix anything. I hope I haven't ruined my life and my future. I need some help, please. 

To help out, I've tried to outline my accounts, and bills that I know I will for sure need to take care of in the coming months. I don't get another student loan deposit till January. I don't know what to do, or where to begin, or how to move forward. I feel stuck and like there's nothing I can do, but I am motivated to try something to improve my situation.

*Checking Account* - $4117.29 (The base of this is remaining from the student loans dispersed to me in August. I've got ~$350-400 coming in every two weeks, after taxes, from the two part- time jobs I am working. But it’s never a set amount.)

Bitcoin,"I humbly suggest we incorporate a new motto: ""The term blockchain is undefined""","I've been involved with this sub since 2013 (I delete my account every so often) and since the last bubble we have a lot of new members here. I came on right after a bubble and received a lot of information from this sub and am excited about the opportunity to give back to the newbies.

One of the things I felt was very effective in this sub were the mottos we've adopted. Interestingly they came about to protect newcomers from common pitfalls as they became known.

1. ""Read the white paper"" - Protection against losing sight of what is being achieved.
2. ""Don't invest more than you're willing to lose"" - Protections against some of the fervor the market generated.
3. ""Not your keys, not your coins"" - Protection against failing exchanges like Mt.Gox

While the whole ""blockchain not bitcoin"" attack isn't new the various scam coins made a killing off of this in the last run up. My personal belief is that this is primarily due to the fact that the term ""blockchain"" is undefined and I believe it's time we adopt a motto to help protect against these kinds of scams.

What does ""undefined"" mean? It doesn't mean that there is no meaning. Obviously everybody who ever used the term had a meaning in mind. However if you took a survey of 100 people from various backgrounds there would be little to no consistency between them aside from an alias for a ""block"" like ""record"", or ""data"" and another alias for ""chain"" like ""table"" or ""ledger"". As there is no official definition as a software engineer I can see how the term ""blockchain"" could be used to describe everything from the bitcoin block chain to a linked list. 

Surely Satoshi gave a definition? Actually the white paper itself never used the term ""blockchain"" and in fact never even says ""block chain"". It speaks of blocks and chains as very general concepts but never uses them together as a term.

See for yourself: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

So where does the technical definition of ""blockchain"" reside? While we all (hopefully) know that Wikipedia is not a source, it does cite it's articles.

&gt; A blockchain,[1][2][3] originally block chain,[4][5] is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography.[1][6] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,[6]

Notice all but one of the sources come from articles in *2016* a full seven years after bitcoin was created and the top three are The Economist, Fortune and The New York Times. I think anyone with a background in computer science or digital cryptography would agree that these are not authorities in the computer science, cryptographical or cryptocurrency spaces.

By adding the motto ""The term blockchain is undefined"" to our conversations we accomplish a few things:
1. Creating another distinction between Bitcoin and other (potentially, likely) scam coins.
2. Educating the public that technology which has been around for decades could be described as using a blockchain.
3. Remind everyone that no authority exists who could give a technical definition of what a blockchain is.

I believe there will be another run up with the next halvening and when that happens the shit coins will flow once again. I believe we have an opportunity now to lessen their ability to sucker the general public into wasting their money on pump and dumps.

We are both early 30's and have no intention of having children within the next 5 years (or not at all) so space is not an issue for us. We would rather go smaller than sacrifice location. We are currently renting an apartment in the area, but would like to buy sometime next year.

Our combined salary is around 125k. No debt. We have about 65k in a high yield savings account, and 120k in retirement. Current rent is $1500 a month. We only have one car that is paid off. We are saving a combined 4k monthly into our savings which would ultimately be used for the house. My Credit is around 775, and hers is about 800.

We are currently looking at 1br condos in the area in the 3-350k range with \~$300 HOA dues. Townhouses in the area start at around 450k-500k and go up quickly from there. By next year, we would have enough saved to put 20% down on a condo, but not a townhouse. We could put down less on a more expensive townhouse, but then we would also have PMI, and would already be stretching our budget. Or we could continue renting and saving for a couple more years to buy a townhouse. I worry about the rising interest rates, and though the market has stabilized a bit here, it is still going up. If we did buy a condo, however, we are not in a rush to move and wouldn't mind living there for at least the next 5 years, after which we could sell and move into a slightly larger house. What would make the most sense in our situation? Buy something smaller now with 20% down, stretch our budget for something larger, or wait for a couple more years?",finance

gaming,"Overwatch is the biggest fundamental failure of its genre of games, and here's why","Lemme start this post off by letting you know that I LOVE team based shooters, and by team based I don't mean team deathmatch in Call of Duty which is one word short from being a free for all. I'm talking games like Counter Strike, Team Fortress 2 and the subject of this post, Overwatch.  


***Disclaimer: I own the PC version of Overwatch. What I'm saying may or may not apply to the other versions of the game.***

I'll leave my controversial points for last, but let's start with something that most of us can agree on.  


Overwatch's Servers are horrible.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not talking about Custom Servers, which are actually done very well, I'm talking about public matches, specifically Arcade games. 

Let's say you want to play the new Junkenstein game-mode, cool! Just choose regular/endless and start up the lobby... and... waiting... You'll be in the queue for at least 2 minutes, but ya know what? Fair enough, you're probably being matched up with like-minded players who will be at your same skill cap so you can grow and level-up as players together right?  
*laughs heartily* **Nope.** You'll be stuck with Mr. Top 100 at the ranked leader-board and Newb Timothy here, with the game taking its sweet time loading in that fourth player... Why the hell is this taking so long, you might be asking, it's not a glitch. It's not a lack of players, [Overwatch is the eighth most played game on PC](https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-20-core-pc-games/), and this is not even taking into account the console versions. This is because the server coordinator for Overwatch is the second laziest server coordinator I've ever seen, only beaten by a free to play game that was released as a joke. Proof? Sadly I've got nothing but experience to prove this, and a very good example of its shoddiness came today. I was lobbied into Junkenstein with two other players after a two minute wait, and we spent another two minutes waiting for a fourth. The cut-scene started, and the other two players must've been asleep, because none of them hit skip, so either this was the first time they ever played Junkenstein (which i guarantee isn't the case with their levels as proof), or they have literally stopped caring. **Keep a mental note of this for later.**  
Three minutes into our match, one of the players just. leaves. and the game never reimburses us with a fourth later on, so either the game prevents you from joining in the middle of a match, or the game coordinator is THIS terrible, and either choice is a strike against this game. We ended up losing to a boss because three players worth of dps was not NEARLY enough on the lowest difficulty, and the one player who left was one of the DPS intensive characters.  


But, hey, whatever, this all doesn't matter if the game is fun right? You can just grab some friends and play together instead of relying on s\*\*\*\* matchmaking, right? Well you better be ready to stay PG, because if you and your friends are caught saying something even mildly offensive to anything, you will be hit with that ban hammer, it doesn't matter if you spent eighty dollars on this game (which is just another strike against this game) and you spent additional dollars on loot-boxes, you will lose it all. Unless you have the disc version then it's a matter of having a PS plus account as your home console, but then you have to start over in terms of progression, and oh boy is the progression unforgiving.  


You know you f\*\*\*ed up a game when you have more brutal micro-transactions than Electronic Arts. This isn't the most popular games since it's milking one of EA's cash cows, but Plants Vs Zombies Garden Warfare 1-2 are both team based shooters that were released by EA for the current gen consoles, and not only do they have more stable progression than Overwatch, they also have better cosmetic selections and a way better system for them. PVZGW employs the coin system, and sticker packs, basically, you gain coins by winning matches or buying them, and you can spend those coins on Sticker packs that give you cosmetics and other various in-game items. Why is this a good system in comparison? Well...

  
A. Coins are obtained relatively easily, you only need to play one-two matches to gain enough of them for the standard sticker packs, or you can save up five matches worth for a higher end pack that is guaranteed to give you something rare.  
B. In Garden Warfare 2, the coins can be used in an event store that allows you to buy a selection of high end items directly, and while the prices are much less generous, it is very feasible to obtain all of them within the event period if you are a diligent player without buying a thing.  
C. No Duplicates. You cannot receive a single duplicate in any part of GW 1 or 2. If you come into a situation where you unlocked an item before you got it in an achievement, you get a very generous reimbursement of coins for not getting the achievement reward.  


And not only that, but you can customize nearly every aspect of your playable character in GW, and you will probably have two-three parts of every section of each character by the second day of playing this game. Compare this to Overwatch, which has loot-boxes that slow your progression the longer you play the game (because of level-up mechanics), and the completely slow Arcade System that has slower server queues than regular modes.  


***Why I made this post:***

I decided to come back to Overwatch after a \~4 month long hiatus, I just renewed my PS Plus Account, was excited to play the game I used to enjoy so much.. and I decided to hit up the Arcade modes, since that's what I do every single time I play Overwatch since the cosmetics are my only driving force to play that game, which is not the best sign of things to come... I unlocked the free Halloween loot-box they give each year and got jack squat, then I headed into Junkenstein, where I got into that story I just told. So I decided to just go into the Random Free for All 8 player game-mode.  


I do not get legitimately angry at a game, but I was basically turning into the irl un-ironic version of AVGN because of this game-mode, this game-mode, which was the only other alternative to gaining a Loot-box other than grinding my controller to dust in Casual Play because of the sheer amount of experience needed. Every. Single. Time. I was in fifth place, just one position under the amount REQUIRED to win and gain a loot-box from this game-mode, I completely shut off my PS4 and abandoned Overwatch for good after [this monstrosity](https://imgur.com/a/x5QXBKf). And even though I was advocating for Overwatch to the TF2 community for months, I am never, ever combing back to this game unless they completely revamp the mechanics, which will never happen. Wanna know what the issue is? Team fights. In this ""Free for all"", team fights were prevalent, because of the in-game mechanic that allows you to see the enemy's health-bar, this basically incentivizes players to get into huge fights and try to pick off the lower health player, which will be you, this means that you will only win if you either memorized every single spawn location on the map, and were an expert player, or by complete luck of the draw.  


Tl;dr: Overwatch drove me into the biggest fit I've ever had over a video-game in my life, and I'm ditching it for TF2.",technology
personalfinance,"My new life situation requires me to fly fairly often at my own expense. I'm trying to figure out the smartest approach to booking flights. Does it make sense for me to keep shopping for the lowest cost flight every flight, or to begin building loyalty with an airline for frequent flyer benefits?","As an overview of my financial situation...some seriously stupid spending habits &amp; a failed business venture out of college left me struggling with some embarrassingly hefty credit card debt. I've been working on improving my credit score to the point where I can qualify for a refinancing loan at a decently low interest rate while I knock this out. This year I've paid off about a quarter of my debt, got a couple medical collections removed from my report, and gone from a 630 to 718 in the past 5 months...my goal is ~750 before taking out the loan. I'm hammering the debt down as fast as I can, currently able to put about $1200 per month towards credit cards (total debt is still over $10k).

Anyway, I recently moved across the US from my east coast hometown to the west coast. I estimated I'll be needing to fly back at least 4 times per year for important holidays/family functions. Additionally, my girlfriend is from the UK, and she's been begging me to make it over there to meet her family. And I may need to take another couple of flights for work purposes during the year.

I have my own one man consulting company so all of these flights are out of pocket. Trying to figure out the smartest way to book these.

My current approach is to just book the cheapest possible flight every time regardless of airline. 

However, I know there are some great airline rewards/frequent flyer programs I could be missing out on. I wonder if it would make sense for me to sometimes pay a little more per flight to try and stay loyal to a single airline. I've never really participated in these programs before so I don't know how deep the benefits can be.

I'm also aware of airline miles credit cards. Theoretically it might actually help my credit score opening another card to increase my available credit. But I don't really want to risk having another card given my current debt situation.

Any advice on the best way to go about this?",finance
personalfinance,Are personal loans or debt consolidation worth it to pay off large amounts of debt?,"I’ve lurked for a long time on my other account and finally have courage to talk about my situation. I’m on mobile so I really hope the formatting is okay. I’ve accumulated ~$25K of credit card debt and I’m deeply ashamed of it. It’s overwhelmed my life and prevent me from having any kind of savings or leftover money. 

Some short backstory. I was young and stupid and got involved with what I know now to be an abusive man. I relied on him for shelter (his own house). I opened up numerous credit cards in my name only, and paid for nearly everything. So much of what I bought was pointless and most just went to him or his benefit. I have bank backed cards and retail/department store cards. After several years, I was finally able to escape with the help of a local organization. They provided a deposit for a new apartment (I pay for the rent and utilities).

Between my rent, utilities, phone, insurance, basic food (very limited food budget), and all my credit card payments, I have zero money left over. I had been able to save a few hundred, but emergency car repair took that away as well as whatever credit I had built (I literally had to pay with four different cards). My area has no real public transportation and my car is required with my job.  I live in Southern California, unable to leave at this time, and desperately want to save to move to a lower cost area, but also want to be 100% prepared for that when I really make the change.

I current take home about 2800/month and over 1000 goes to debt repayment alone. I can’t contribute to retirement because I need every dollar I can get. My credit score has tanked from 780 to about 650 in the last two years due to high balances, some late payments, and going over my credit limit. My interest rates often make it so whatever payment I do make does nothing or sometimes has not even covered the new monthly charge. I can’t get any new credit cards due to my risk. I don’t even use my cards for anything anymore because of my lack of available credit and just use my debit for any expenses. I have about $150 to my name and I don’t get paid for two weeks.

I’ve been trying to research debt consolidation or maybe a personal loan, but have no idea of the process. I just really don’t want to lock myself into something I can’t handle especially given how I feel now. I’m sure my interest rate on a loan would be in the 20s. I can still handle 700-800/month in payments, because even that would be less than what I pay now and would give me a small but extremely helpful cushion.

Is this a good option for me? Should I go through my bank, another bank, or a service? Is there another solution I’m not thinking of? I’m just so lost and feel like crying when I think about my situation.",finance
personalfinance,What should I do with an unexpected cash influx?,"So the short version is I've come into about $20k in unexpected income this month, and there is another $20k that I *am* expecting beyond my usual monthly income over the next few months(both after tax) and I'm trying to figure out best course of action to do with it.

My current situation:

* Emergency fund is already fully stocked for six months
* Currently I owe about $50k on a car loan, 2.04% interest rate
* No other debts
* Currently saving to buy my first house, but just barely started. Only about $15k stashed away so far. For my housing market I figure I probably want about 10x that before I look at buying.
* I'm currently maxing my 401k plus 50% employer match, but not a whole lot else going on with retirement savings right now. Mega backdoor roth is open to me, but currently not utilized. This money wouldn't directly be eligible, but I could just bump my contributions way up and then use it to replace the missing income.

The way I see it, I have three main options:

1. Put it towards the car. That said, is that worth it at a %2.04% interest rate? Even my plain old savings account is paying 1.9% now, and rates keep climbing.
2. Sock it away with the 15k, which will collectively get me about a third of the way there, maybe in a position to buy in a few more years.
3. Throw it in an index fund, settle into renting for the long haul, and see if the housing market cools off eventually.

So what would you do? Any additional options I'm not considering?",finance

personalfinance,Fixed versus variable interest mortgage,"At the moment we have a mortgage of 450k remaining and 20 year term with 1.7% variable interest.

So my question is, which option would you recommend? I'm leaning towards 10 year fixed and then after that even if the interest rates are high it will be of a much lower principal and we will also be able to pay in some extra (50k ish?).

Identify - I identified this market as AUDCAD is at a key resistance level with daily lows coming in at the 0.9300 area. 

We also have the Bank of Canada looking to hike interest rates and should see an increase in the value of the Canadian Dollar leading up to that event. 
 

Plan - Looking for a trade we needed to see the market form a bearish pattern here and we can see the market double topped at the key resistance area. This is where patience is required to wait for the lower low. Now the market is retesting the neckline resistance. This is a good area to look for a short as previous structure support should act as resistance.

Trade - I have taken a position at the neckline with stops above a small sticking point. This stop is aggressive to give us a better reward to risk ratio. Target previous key support around 0.9150.",finance

Basically I’m currently in a bit of a situation in which I’ve accrued just under 4K worth of debt (though the interest on one causes this to continue increasing), some of which I weren’t aware of due to troubling years couch surfing between friends and partners etc,  as I don’t have a great connection with my family due to again, a troubling upbringing. 

As no contact was frequent between any of companies it has gotten to the case of these needing to be paid imminently, and I am currently out of work due to a year of mentally and physically debilitating illness. I’m finally going back to work part-time in November, which I was excited for until I became aware of all this. Some of these things I even thought were sorted years ago. I also need to move from my current living situation to my own place come January, leaving me with even less money to pay.

What are my options of paying this off? I spoke to a company called ‘Stepchange’, but until I start my job and move out I can’t set in stone how my financial situation will be. I considered a debt consolidation loan but I don’t want this to cause future issues, as well as high interest rates overall. A DRO would also cause me to struggle actually acquiring a place of my own. 

Anyone been in a similar situation at all? Or gone down the route of a debt consolidation loan?

personalfinance,Mobile/‘Branchless’ Banking Advice,"I’m going to hit 18 at the end of the month here, and I’m really finding that I dislike the way my current ‘brick and mortar’ bank operates. The hours do NOT work with my schedule, deposits and withdrawals are a PITA, and I guess Brazilians love trying to hack them since this is gonna be the third time in 6 months I’ve had to get a new card due to data breaches from Brazil that have compromised card information (though now they’ve just straight blacklisted anything from Brazil and are updating security protocol as needed apparently). It’s tiring. 

I keep seeing ads for, as an example, Chime and other things like it, and I do have access to USAA and NFCU through my parents, and all three of those are either ‘branchless’ and online only, or they have like three physical locations on the continental United States, and might as well be ‘branchless’.

What I would like to know is:
- Is ‘branchless’ a good option? These are all FDIC insured so they’re legitimate, and Chime I know has pretty good ‘reviews’ so to speak. Hell, USAA and NFCU are heavily affiliated with the government so they aren’t gonna magically shut down overnight. 

- Does anyone here on r/personalfinance have any recommendations in regards to good mobile/online-only banking apps or banks, especially for more of a ‘beginner’? 

- Are there any ‘branchless’ or online only banking apps/services to stay the *hell* away from? I plan on avoiding Santander and Wells Fargo already, purely because I’ve not heard good things and with my job, I get to deal with their phone services. Utter bullshit is what it is, but I digress. 

If anyone has any resources to point me towards as well, that would be great! Google has not been super helpful, though maybe I’ve not googled the right things for what I need to pop up. I’m trying to be as thorough as possible about choosing what service I want to use since I *really* don’t want what little money I have right now to go up in smoke if something goes wrong, even though FDIC should cover what I have, since it isnt much. Interest rates aren’t super important, but my bank doesn’t even have 1% interest for my Savings account, which kinda sucks for a savings account. No monthly fees/OD charges would be a bonus, but isn’t needed, since I don’t *plan* on ODing my account(s), but shit happens lol.

investing,BONDS,"I am relatively new to investing. Lmk if I’m off on anything

I am trying to learn more about investing in bonds. Market over valuation combined with  raised interest rates and Fed indicating future rate hikes has attracted me to bond investment. Do interest rates have the same effect on bond ETFs as they do individual bonds? Do you recommend  purchasing Series I/EE bonds directly online? Or going for Bond ETF such as FLRN. Note: i don’t have a large amount of money to put away in 20 yr maturity bonds. I would prefer to gradually add to the bond investment.

I'm trying to be better about how I save and organize my money. I suppose I'm mostly asking what the rest of you do to manage your day to day finances and how it works for you. My wife and I are trying to save for a house purchase and I have a feeling I need to organize myself better, but not sure. I think I would like to open a new savings to earmark savings for a down payment.

Currently I have a number of accounts with a single bank that I use day-to-day:

* **Checking 1** : prime checking account, I have a debit card for this. Paycheck goes into here. Mostly used for odds and ends, if I'm not using a credit card.
* **Money Market**: technically a checking account, but I get a better interest rate. Most of my liquid savings is here. 
* **Savings 1**: general savings. I normally, manually push $X from my income to here. I occasionally dip into this in case I need to pay for something bigger. Once I reach a certain amount of $, I push a chunk of it to Money Market
* **Savings 2**: for rent and car. I push money from income to here for payment of larger static expenses every month (mostly rent and car payment)
* **Savings 3**: for recreation. I have a couple expensive hobbies, I push what I can into this for the times I need to repair/upgrade/buy new things for these hobbies
* **Savings 4**: for car. I travel a lot for work and I get mileage reimbursed. I put all this into here in case I need a major car repair / purchase

CryptoCurrency,"Underlay (MIT) is a global, distributed graph database of public knowledge","The Underlay is a global, distributed graph database of public knowledge. Initial hosts will include universities and individuals, such that no single group controls the content. This is an attempt to replicate the richness of private knowledge graphs in a public, decentralized manner.

## Rationale

While knowledge production is accelerating, systems for sharing and assessing knowledge are falling behind[1](https://underlay.mit.edu/#fn1). Powerful collections of machine-readable knowledge are growing in importance each year, but most are privately owned (e.g., Google’s *Knowledge Graph*, *Wolfram Alpha*, *Scopus*). The Underlay aims to secure such a collection as a public resource. It also gives chains of provenance a central place in its data model, to help tease out bias or error that can appear at different layers of assumption, synthesis, and evaluation.

## Phase 1

A proof-of-concept with two different communities of active users, supporting overlays for technical papers building on past research: a prior-art archive and a repository of academic papers[5](https://underlay.mit.edu/#fn5). We are recruiting companies and universities to contribute collections for this work. We will work with other protocol layers to define the initial federation model, and decentralize the underlay with IPFS. (Summer 2018)

financialindependence,Are low income early retirees cheating by claiming ACA tax credits?,"It can be a sensitive topic, whether early retirees, people with a lot of wealth but not necessarily a lot of taxable income, should qualify for low-income government benefits - notably ACA premium tax credits - since they're kind of freeloading.  That wealth isn't just sitting there, though, and I got curious just exactly what the ""business"" of mutual fund portfolio looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

Say VFIAX, which tracks the S&amp;P 500.  The S&amp;P 500 companies have a combined market cap of $25T and employ about 25 million people, so a $1M stake in VFIAX has about one virtual employee.  Imagining that employee makes the median income, the virtual business pays $4,500 in payroll taxes.  The price/sales ratio is around 2, and P/E around 23, which means virtual sales of $500,000 and profits of $43,000.  In 2017, the S&amp;P companies had an aggregate, effective tax rate of 30%, so the virtual business paid $18,000 in income tax, for a total of $22,500 federal taxes. (haven't tried to guess how this will change in 2018)

&amp;#x200B;

For contrast, a single person with no savings with take-home pay of $43,000 would have salary around $55,000 and pay $4,200 in payroll taxes and (for 2018) $4,500 in income tax, for a total of $8,700.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone following the 4% rule on $1M portfolio has spending of $40k, but has income something like $17,000 in dividends and maybe $7,500-$10,000 in realized capital gains (depending on how early retired).  With nominal income of, say $25,000, the single, early retiree qualifies for ACA subsidies to bring health care premiums down to $136/month, which may represent a tax subsidy of $5500/year or more, depending on age and location.  Deducting that from the taxes paid by his virtual business, leaves federal taxes paid of $17,000

&amp;#x200B;

A single worker with AGI of $50,800 would not qualify for any ACA subsidy, but is hopefully covered under an employer plan.  His net taxes paid are still $8,700, or less than half of what the early retiree pays.",finance
personalfinance,"15 year mortgage vs 30 year mortgage vs retirement: my $100,000 mistake","\*EDIT\* A little more background. I share this house with my GF (soon to be wife) who has her own retirement account and investments. The house P&amp;I makes up 14% of our pretax income so we still have about $1,600 monthly after all our expenses. We plan to live at this house for the rest of our lives and we are putting money into the house in renovations. We are at 65% LTV.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple years ago when interest rates bottomed out I made the choice of refinancing my 30 year into a 15 year at a 2.75% rate. I was borrowing at a rate of 4.375% prior to this. But I had the option of 3.5% if I wanted to refinance back into a 30 year. The balance on my existing mortgage was $190,000. The monthly difference worked out to around $436

&amp;#x200B;

My decision to do this was based on fear over my parents mistakes with mortgages. This made it so I would be free of a mortgage by age 44. Sounded great and for some the freedom is worth the hit towards retirement

&amp;#x200B;

I am posting this because maybe my math is flawed. Or maybe my math is right and this could help someone.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently put $667 monthly into 401k. This doesnt change in either scenario. The below scenario is based on 7% returns compounded yearly

&amp;#x200B;

**30 year**

$853.18 monthly and $117,146.57 interest

&amp;#x200B;

**15 year**

$1289.38 monthly and $42,088.60 in interest

&amp;#x200B;

**30 year scenario:**

$436.20 extra towards 401k

&amp;#x200B;

666.67 monthly to 401k + 436.20 = 1102.87 monthly for 30 years

&amp;#x200B;

$1,250,135.61 by age 59

&amp;#x200B;

**15 year scenario:**

666.67 monthly to 401k = $201,132.69 after 15 years

&amp;#x200B;

then 666.67 + 1,289.38 = $1956.05 monthly for the next 15 years

&amp;#x200B;

$1,144,774.92 in savings by age 59

&amp;#x200B;

So it looks like i shot myself in the foot $100,000

**Option 1**

The best interest rate I can get right now is around 4.75% and I'm putting 10% down.

* House Cost: $550,000
* 10% Down: $55,000
* 4.75% Mortgage: $495,000
* Total cost of mortgage over 30 years: $936,173.

**Option 2**

Wait another year so I can save another $20,000.  Assuming that interest rates go up .50% and I put down 10% + the extra $20,000.

* House Cost: $550,000
* 10% Down + 20K: 
* 5.25% Mortgage: $475,000
* Total cost of mortgage over 30 years: $944,268

Difference in total cost of the loan is $8095.00.

My questions are:

1. I know it's not possible to know for sure but is a .50% interest rate raise for a 30 year loan in 12 months reasonable?  Will it probably go up more?
2. What is the better option assuming housing costs stay flat?
3. Is 20K now more valuable that 8K over the life of a 30 year loan given inflation?

gaming,Remembering old games: Star Wars: Republic Commando,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vkj7221oxrs11.jpg

Hello everyone, friends, the Star Wars universe is growing and developing, but probably many fans of this universe, like me, are waiting for other films and other games, one of the most interesting games on Star Wars was Star Wars: Republic Commando, I interviewed one of the authors of the game and you can finally find out whether Sev survived and how they saw the continuation of the game, as well as interesting ideas that could turn into a separate game about Darth Maul.

&amp;#x200B;

[  Kevin Schmitt ](https://i.redd.it/em6qetv4yrs11.jpg)

  

**How did you get a job at Lucas Arts?**

I graduated from college with a degree in Architecture and I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I packed up and moved to San Francisco, California, USA. While I was in college, I found a book about ILM, Industrial Light &amp; Magic, the special effects company behind the Star Wars movies, as well as many others. After reading it, I saw that George Lucas had another company, Lucasarts. Both of which were based around San Francisco. Since I didn’t really know what I wanted to do, I figured I should head about and just be around these companies and see what I can do. Once I got out there, I wrote a letter a week to ILM, Lucasfilm, and Lucasarts asking for a job. After about 3 months, I got a call from Lucasarts. They were looking for somebody with an Architecture background to help them with their new game and the lady from HR remembered my resume and my Architecture degree. I was hired a few weeks later 

**Did you like to create games for Star Wars?** 

I have always been a huge Star Wars fan. I grew up with all the toys, Star Wars wallpaper on my walls, Star Wars bedsheets, Star Wars birthday parties, etc. so working on Star Wars was a dream for me. We were relatively small back then so I got the chance to write a lot of dialogue as well as design levels. Getting the chance to create backstories was fun. In Rogue Squadron, I got the chance to write a story about how Crix Madine, from Return of the Jedi, defected to the Rebel Alliance. Although it isn’t canon anymore, it was still fun to create these kinds of stories and play in George’s universe.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8gzlvlvdyrs11.jpg

  

**Can you tell which game you liked to work the most and why?** 

I have to say, Republic Commando was my favorite. We had a great team of really talented people and we were all up against some pretty big internal odds. As far as the subject matter, it was awesome to get the chance to tell the story of a non-hero in the classic Star Wars sense. No Luke, no Vader, etc, this was about the troops on the ground doing the job they were literally born and bred to do. It was fun to explore the brotherhood, the tactics, and the basics of Star Wars combat. I think the team delivered a truly unique Star Wars experience.

**Star Wars: Republic The commando turned out to be a unique game in the full-blown star wars, because we looked at the story through the eyes of the clones, their relationship history, the game is very interesting not only to play, but also to watch the story, why do you think why still do not continue?** 

Well, the main reason is that Lucasarts shut down. Often, while working on a game, it is hard to see how the product will turn out until the very end when it all comes together. While creating Republic Commando, we all kind of felt that this game would be special and we had a lot of fun in this universe. With that in mind, we built in a cliffhanger ending with the full intention of going back to revisit the clones. We actually had 2 ideas for a sequel, one of which centered around Order 66. We knew some details from Episode 3 and how Order 66 was used and the idea was that the next game would start with the rest of the commandoes on a rescue mission for Sev and a mission or two later, they would get Order 66. I liked this idea a lot because I loved Tie Fighter and playing the bad guys. Order 66 would have given us an opportunity to see the commandoes hunting down Jedi, which we had never seen before in a game.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3j21ttjiyrs11.jpg

  

**What do you think about the games that come out on this universe?**

I really enjoyed The Force Unleashed series of games. My good friend, John Stafford, wrote them and they were a lot of fun. I was looking forward to the 2 titles that were in development when Lucasarts got shut down, but we will never see them.

I would like to see more games made in the universe, but really try and stretch beyond the normal. It is such a vast universe filled with super interesting characters that could carry a story on their own.

As much as I would like titles that don’t feature classic heroes, I will say that while I was at Lucasarts, we had 2 ideas for games that I always wanted to make. My friend, Ryan Kaufman (Narrative Director at Telltale Games) and I always wanted to make a Han Solo smuggler game. We had outlined a world and gameplay that was very similar to what we now call an “open world game” and would have dived into his smuggling past; buying ships, stealing stuff, going up against rival smugglers and bandits. 

The other was a Darth Maul stealth game. When Episode 1 was being developed, Ryan and I were convinced Darth Maul would be a hit (at the time, management saw him as a bit player) and since we played a lot of Tenchu: Stealth Assassins in our down time, we pitched a stealth Darth Maul game in the Tenchu style. The game would have revolved around him hunting down people in the Trade Federation in an effort to make them ally with Darth Sidious. It was the perfect set-up since the existence of the Sith had to be secret so stealth would be important.

**What are you doing today?**

I am a Senior Designer at Microsoft/343 Industries. The last title I worked on was Halo 5. Kind of ironic because the whole time we were working on Republic Commando, we looked at Halo as our inspiration.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lpo8hvkpyrs11.jpg

Many games in the Star Wars universe, tell us the story of classic characters, showing or duplicating the story shown in movies or books, very few games where we are told and shown the direction of ordinary people, moral choices, the relationship between them and characters. Star Wars: Republic Commando turned out to be an ideal game, it showed the history of clones, although not quite ordinary infantrymen, and the special squad, despite the fact that they are clones, each of them has its own character, its natural feelings and emotions, the game turned in the film where not the annoying Jedi and Sith, but clones whose side and essence are practically not shown in the films and only in the cartoon reveal us to the foreground, they did not come to the fore. The story of the game tells us the actions that took place after Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, and shows us its Delta squad, an elite division of clones, prepared according to a special program that included enhanced training and a course of survival. The game shows the Delta-38 clones (""Boss"" player character) as well as Deltas 62, 40 and 07 (""Scorch"", ""Fixer"" and ""Sev"", respectively)

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mmu6mxjuyrs11.jpg

The character of each of the characters was strikingly different, the Boss was a clone most similar to Django Fett, due to his tough temper and stubborn nature, as well as the inherited accent of the “father”. The rest of the “deltas” had other voices, while still a teenager, during the training, the boss broke instructor Valon Vau's arm, for which he appointed him commander in the group. Fixer was a specialist in cracking computers and locks in Delta, as well as an expert in the field of any technology. While studying at Kamino, Fixer was Valon's pet due to his laconism and the status of being the most disciplined in the team, which is why he became Deputy Boss. Sev Being a born predator, was a group sniper and perhaps the most brutal fighter among them. Sev wore armor with a blood-red marking, and this color was so similar to real blood that even comrades doubted whether it was really paint. Because of his eerie sense of humor, he seemed to be a sadistic and psychopath pushed, although during the execution of tasks he was as cool as ever. Finally, Scorch, got his nickname after an unsuccessful workout using explosives. Later, Scorch became an expert in explosives and a professional demolition man in the squadron, and he loved this job with all his heart, preferring grenade launchers. In addition to these talents, he had a sense of humor, could find a funny side in any situation and joke even during a fight. Most often, Scorch made fun of Sev, and he reciprocated, maintaining an atmosphere of fraternal relations and friendly rivalry.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/y2vnsvbyyrs11.jpg

Starting from the mission to Geonosis and beyond, we discover the relationships between the clones, the characters of the characters, and gradually they become real combat friends. We are shown this not only through dialogues, but also in such small details as checking equipment, tapping with fists, and with each new mission you begin to get used to and become attached to these heroes. Thus, the loss of Seva was painfully experienced at the end of the game. Omitting the plot and revealing the characters, the game was a tactical first-person shooter, where we gave orders to eliminate the target, take up a defensive position, explode doors and everything else, although the game was far from possible interactions with the same Swat, but it lacked action them for competent management squad. The game had a large variety of weapons, not only represented by the Federation's arsenal, but also Wookie crossbows, ray peaks that use elite Geosianians and many other weapons. In general, the game was a show of explosions, shots and dead bodies, where unmatched music played in the background.

personalfinance,Is going into home foreclosure as simple as not paying? Other then credit plummeting what should we know that we may not?,"My wife and I are stepping to explore options for her mother. She just had brain surgery and a lot of things have gone down hill. The down and dirty is this:

-Her monthly income all in is $1,023. $600 from social security, $400 from work 
-Her monthly mortgage, utilities, food, insurances, and gas are about $1,400.
-The expenses don't include credit card debt of $7,200, which she hasn't been able to even make the minimum payment on.
-She declared chap 7 bankruptcy 4 years ago, so that with the credit cards way behind, her credit score is non-existant
-owes $62k on the house
-We just had the house appraised, and it came in at $39k. (we expected that or worse. Please do not question this number simply because your unfamiliar with housing prices outside your location).
-We need to move her out of the house. It's falling apart and in a bad section of town 

Our current plan; stop paying the $671 mortgage and apply it all to her credit card debt and start the foreclosure process. From what I'm researching (Maryland) she will have about 6 months before having to be fully evicted. This 6 months will be crucial to knocking down her credit card debt. In the meantime apply for some programs which can potentially help offset her utilities and food. Again any extra money goes towards credit card debt. Find a place she can rent for $600/month. (if we can't find one then my wife and I have considered buying a small $60-70k home and renting it to her for cost of mortgage).

What flaws are in the plan of action we are taking? We understand her credit will be wrecked, but it is already bad and we care more about her then the bank that she's paid $32k in interest to from the extremely high interest rate they slapped her with. We also don't think she will ever be buying a home again, and we don't want her to ever get another credit card lol.",finance

Figured it was about time I started doing more with my money than saving and trying to make ends meet.

**Present Income:**

**Gross:** $35k/year, $2917/mo

**Net:**   $2616.44/mo

I have 1 year left on my parents' healthcare, after which I will be responsible for it and most likely will just have a student plan through my school (good idea/bad idea?)

I have an emergency fund built ($5000)

I currently have $3000 sitting in savings/checking accounts that I could probably be doing better things with. 

**Present Expenses:**

* Rent: $1200/mo *(usually split w/roommate)*

* Internet/Utilities: $150-$200/mo *(usually split w/roommate)*

* Food: typically between $100-$200/mo, unless I'm budgeting hard and keep it to around $80/mo. Haven't tracked it closely since I stopped barely making ends meet. I'll be assuming $150/mo for this.

* Insurance (car, renters, etc): ~$60/mo

* Phone bill: $20/mo

Total (assuming $150/mo on food and $175/mo on Internet/Utilities): $942.5/mo *w/roommate*; $1605/mo *w/o roommate*

Net after necessary expenses: $1673.94/mo *w/roommate*; $1011.44/mo *w/o roommate*

Most likely, I won't be without a roommate more than 1 or 2 months in a year.

**Upcoming expenses:**

Oil pan gaskets need replaced on my car. Upper end quote I got was $1500, so I'll just assume worst case on that. (If it seems high, it's an issue of a semi-odd engine construction requiring a lot of labor since the oil pan connects the engine block to some of the supports or something.)
My car is a whole is 13 years old with 150k miles on it, but transmission, breaks, and cylinder heads have all been rebuilt/replaced in the last 3 years, so I don't foresee too many problems here. (Especially considering I rarely drive more than a hundred or so miles a month.) Accident seems most likely to be what requires excessive car expenses/needing a new car. 

No unsubsidized student loans, but I do still have $3000 in subsidized loans (will remain in school as a grad student for another 3-5 years for PhD). I'm currently just sitting on it since there's no interest on them.

I am currently in the 2nd lowest Federal tax bracket, and State income tax is around 5.25%. I have very little concern about getting a research position in my field post-graduation and will probably have starting income between $80,000 and $100,000+. 

-------------------------------------------------------------

Based on this, and what I read in the subreddit wiki/faq, I should be able to start contributing about $450/mo (slightly more than 15% gross income) to a Roth IRA. I'm assuming a Roth IRA would be preferable over a 401(k) or something else since I have no employment matching on my fellowship/grant money stipend.

**Main things I would like to know:** 

* Is my analysis correct on finding and opening a Roth IRA? 

* After maxing out a Roth IRA, I'd still have around $400/mo left (or $1000 if I have a roommate), what would be good to look into doing with this? Aside from anticipating needing a new car due to a crash/some other failure (both I feel aren't terribly likely) I don't have much in the way of short-term goals. So perhaps looking into independent 401(k) options?

* Should I be trying to pay off my subsidized loan ASAP or am I correct in letting it sit until closer to graduation since there is no interest on it for several years yet?

* How much should I be planning ahead for needing independent health insurance? (most likely will just get it through my school)

* Any other advice you'd have to give someone who's primary knowledge of personal finance comes from reading this subreddit's FAQ/Wiki

Our home was purchased for 90K at 3.875% APR, and owe $82,700 principle. I believe would sell now for 115K conservatively.

personalfinance,Buying new car. Could pay with cash. I need to boost my credit score. Tips or Suggestions?,"1 year ago I forgot to pay a credit card that we normally don't use.  Amazon Prime was automatically charged against that card and I didn't pay for 3 months.  Now my score is around 650.

I'm not planning on buying a house in the next year so I'm not really concerned about another temporary drop from opening a new line of credit....but raising my score could save me a whole bunch of money in 2 years when we decide to get our house.

&amp;#x200B;

Subaru doesn't want to talk real numbers until I'm ready to make a purchase but a month ago they were saying I'd maybe have an 11% interest rate which seemed really high.  For now I'm assuming thats the best rate I'll get.

&amp;#x200B;

Using amortization tables meant for a house payments I'm figuring....

$5k loan for 1 year =  $302 in interest.  

$5k loan for 3 years = $893 in interest.  

$10k loan for 1 year = $605 in interest.

$20k loan for 1 year = $1211 in interest.

$20k loan for 3 years = $3572 in interest.

Obviously some scenarios will be impossible because I'm wasting too much money for interest.  

So what is more significant for helping my credit score?  Borrowing less money for a longer amount of time....Or borrowing more money for a shorter amount of time?  Or somewhere in the middle?  

I hate having to throw away money just to boost a credit score...but I've recently learned how significant a 5% vs 5.5% interest rate can change the amount you pay over the life of a mortgage.",finance

First off sorry if this is the wrong sub! But i am looking for some advice for a situation that has been hellish for 2 months now.

Ill keep it short. I owed $7900\~ on my car through Regional Acceptance. I need to sell my car because my insurance premiums were unreasonable.

I found buyers and on Aug 15 initiated a balance transfer from PNC for the exact 20 day payoff amount.

I called both parties looking for updates almost daily for over a month. Neither party was able to ever give me ANY information. So i lost my buyers.

Anyways, apparently PNC stop ordered that check, and reissued a balance transfer Oct 2. To my surprise, my loan was closed out.

HOWEVER, since 2\~ pay periods had passed in this time, i payed $600+ between two monthly payments. Which should have brought the balance to 7300\~. (rounding here) I call Regional to inquire how/when i would receive a refund for the overpayment.

personalfinance,What is my best route for utilizing extra income?,"So a brief background,; I'm a 25 year old male, I have a full time job and a part time job, currently still have a little over $20,000 on student loans and a little over $11,000 on an auto loan. Recently started dating this girl and since I've been trying to become more financially stable and secure so we can eventually get a place together down the road however this is still over a year away as we're both in the mindset of buying over renting so obviously need to make sure things will continue well before that occurs.

My question comes as what I should do with extra income. I don't make a ton of money but currently looking to have more money leftover after my budget (following the 20/30/50 rule) and my part time job isn't even factored into this which gives me$100-200 extra every 2 weeks. 

I've seen that tackling higher interest rates isba good route which would put me at putting it towards my student loans. 
I've seen the avalanche method which would put me at tackling my auto loan.
Or should I put the money into a savings account and save more towards eventually being able to move out?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Blockchain idea - Feedback appreciated,"Hey everyone:

I've been formulating an idea for a usable blockchain currency that directly counteracts Bitmain and dedicated miners essentially accruing mass wealth like our current fiat systems in the world. This is a very rough draft and any critical, productive feedback would be greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Egalité: The cryptocurrency of the people

The biggest problem facing crypto is adoption in usage. There are many theories as to why more people don’t use cryptocurrencies for daily use and why more businesses don’t accept crypto. 

ADOPTION 

People want to feel like they’re a part of something. We see “fanboys/girls” of specific cryptos already choosing sides reminiscent of the iOS/Android wars. This is ridiculous, imagine not using USD while in America because you were a “Euro fanboy”. The need to “belong” to something is innate in humans though, everyone wants to participate in something that can change the world. 

As Asic miners have become more prevalent and the rich are now able to control the hashrate, adoption of Bitcoin and the overall percentage of people who claim to own it has been falling in recent polls. Asic miners have squeezed out average CPU miners and now only the richest people in the world can afford the cost of miners and the electricity needed to produce the hash rate to compete for Bitcoin block rewards. Faced with the knowledge that only rich people are mining Bitcoin, no one wants to “buy” Bitcoin and then use it as currency, when it’s much simpler in the developed countries of the world to just use your own country’s fiat and credit cards. When people don’t have a stake in seeing it succeed, it’s difficult to convince people to use it. 

Asic miners also pose a serious risk to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and any Proof of Work/Proof of Stake coin. The richest people can potentially control the currency if they’re able to control 51% of the hashrate or Stake. If that were to happen, the coin would essentially implode because no one would trust the legitimacy of the currency; something the U.S. dollar currently faces while the Federal Reserve continues to print more dollars every day, devaluing the currency. 

Pre-mined coins face a different issue. When users don’t have a hand in the actual mining of the coin, it takes away a sense of stake of ownership in that coin. “Work” is a very human thing; it gives people a sense of pride and accomplishment. By earning coins through mining, people have a sense of worth that they are a part of something bigger than themselves. Premined coins will never have this sense of earned reward that Proof of Work coins have. 

Egalité will solve this problem by creating a new form of blockchain confirmation process called “Proof of Timed Work”. No longer will hashrate be king. The algorithm that would normally breakdown block rewards based on how many problems were solved (how high your hashrate was), will now divvy up the block rewards based on the amount of time you spent solving those problems, no matter how much CPU/GPU power was used. The goal being to reward every computer working to confirm transactions, not simply the most powerful and the rich elite who own them, continuing the cycle of the wealthy amassing more wealth. The goal is to have every single computer (desktop and handheld) on the planet participating in the mining of Egalité and contributing to confirmation process and the creation of the blockchain.  

MINING REWARDS

Egalité follows a simple 20/80 formula rewarding 20% of block rewards to those users who set their wallet to “High CPU” usage. These are the users with dedicated miners and high end GPU’s. A wallet owner chooses which group they will belong to at any given time, the 20% group or the 80% group. 

The following 80% of block rewards will divvied up between those users who set their wallets to “low cpu” usage. Once switched to this setting, users will be given three options to set the wallet to; ultra low, low, moderate. The 80% of block rewards will be divvied up as follows. 

20% -- Ultra Low: this is a setting that uses negligible CPU. It can run in the background during normal laptop usage. Think Honeyminer or something similar that hackers have been using and average people are unaware of running in the background when coded properly. 

25% -- Low: this setting consumes a small amount more CPU power, similar to a streaming music site. 

35% -- Moderate: CPU is equivalent to running a video game; taxing if other programs were being run at the same time. This setting is perfect for those wanting to leave their laptops running overnight without fear of it being destroyed within a few months. 

BONUS BLOCK REWARDS: 

Mining blocks on a computer should have the same reward system as mining gold during the 1800’s; meaning anyone can strike it rich at any time. 

YEAR 1: Bonus block rewards will be awarded once every block. The algorithm will randomly select an address that participated in the creation of that block, no matter how much or how little CPU was used.

YEARS 2 - 5: Bonus block rewards will be awarded once every hour. The algorithm will randomly select a block that was created during that hour, and then select one random user who participated in the production of that block, no matter how much or how little CPU was used.

YEARS 5 - 10: Bonus block rewards will be awarded once at the end of every day. The algorithm will randomly select a block that was created during that day, and then select one random user who participated in the production of that block, no matter how much or how little CPU was used.

YEARS 10 - 15: Bonus block rewards will be awarded once at the end of every week. The algorithm will randomly select a block that was created during that week, and then select one random user who participated in the production of that block, no matter how much or how little CPU was used.

YEARS 15 - 20: Bonus block rewards will be awarded once at the end of every month. The algorithm will randomly select a block that was created during that month, and then select one random user who participated in the production of that block, no matter how much or how little CPU was used.

YEARS 20 - 30: Bonus block rewards will be awarded once at the end of every year. The algorithm will randomly select a block that was created during that year, and then select one random user who participated in the production of that block, no matter how much or how little CPU was used.

Once mobile apps are up and running, they will be added into the pool of potential bonus blocks if they had a transaction during the chosen block. 

Reward bonus will be a random number generated from the algorithm that is 5-100x the chosen block. 

After the 30th year, bonus block rewards will no longer be awarded. (I’d first want to talk to an economist about inflation and the need for it. The original intent is to fill out the currency and slowly replace fiat in the world. Once that has completely occurred, bonus blocks would stop being awarded.)

WEEN

The goal of any cryptocurrency is to be able to sustain itself once all the block rewards have been mined. The blockchain must still be “confirmed” for it to continue. Taking Bitcoin’s model, each block reward will decrease by 10% every year after the genesis block. This will create a theoretical cap, even though rewards will never end. The original intent follows the Bonus Block logic that once a tipping point occurs and the value of the currency plateaus, smaller rewards will (hopefully) keep pace with inflation.

\*\*The “Ween” is the point I feel would be good to chat with an economist about.",cryptocurrency

investing,Is my understanding of interest rates and how they affect the stock market accurate?,"I'm just trying to fully grasp the concept of rising interest rates (typically) causing the stock market to decline.  Hoping to talk through these in an ELI5 type of format.  Are these reasons/examples accurate?  I highlighted specific questions in bold.  Thank you guys for your help.

1.  With higher mandated interest rates, it costs businesses more money to take out loans.  Less cash readily available from loans = less that companies can grow or take on new initiatives.  Additionally, a lower ROI should be expected given that the cost for these loans is now increased.  **Assuming all of that is correct, what is the specific reason that banks are upping their interest rates for loans?  Is it because they can simply choose to invest their cash in treasury bills at the new increased rate?  And thus, it only makes sense to provide individual/business loans if the interest % is higher than that (and significantly so in order to account for risk)?**

2.  With higher interest rates, personal investors may choose to invest in Treasury bills (very much risk-free) from the government given that the returns are now more attractive.  Stocks, on the contrary, are riskier and would need significant growth potential in order to take on that additional risk.  **Is this true/does it play a significant role in market trends?**

I'm sure there are some other factors I'm overlooking.  Is this relatively accurate or am I really missing the boat?  I really appreciate the help here!",finance
personalfinance,[Housing] HELOC Advice - Fixed or Variable Rate,"I am about to open a home equity line of credit with Chase, with a credit limit of about $100k. I will be making use of the full limit through 2-3 large transactions for various home improvement projects in the next several months. Chase gives me the option to lock in an interest rate when I extract money from the HELOC. Right now the locked interest rate is ~7% compared to a variable rate of about ~6%. I am going to be doing a 10 year repayment period.


If I choose a variable rate, I can lock an interest rate (not the same as the variable rate) at any time for no cost. If I choose a locked rate, I can switch to a variable rate with a fee of 1% of the loan amount.


Looking at the prime rate, it has steadily risen by 0.25% for the last 7 quarters, which has me leaning towards locking in a rate up front each time I need to pull a large amount of money out. But some financial forecasts are saying we will stay at the current prime rate through mid 2019, so maybe a variable rate at first and then a locked rate in mid 2019?


One problem I'm having when trying to decide, I don't know how to calculate the monthly payment of a variable rate loan.  I guess there are a number of ""interest-only"" years, and then a repayment period? If (as an extreme example), the prime rate stays the same for the next 10 years, will the total cost of the loan be the same as my fixed rate loan if they have the same interest rate? Or am I paying for interest during the interest-only years, and then doubling down on that interest in the ""repayment period""...effectively doubling the amount of interest I end up paying over the life of the loan?


I realize this is a lot of scattered questions. I basically don't know what the F I'm doing, so any thoughts/advice would be helpful. I didn't want to do a cash out refi because interest rates are significantly higher than what I currently have on my $500k mortgage, and I've already paid into it for several years so I'd be starting over on my interest (ouch). I also didn't want to just get a loan because I like the flexibility the HELOC gives me for being able to take money out when I want.


Thank you in advance for any and all advice/insults!",finance
personalfinance,Engineering student in $20k of debt,"This is my first time posting onto reddit in general, and this is a throwaway because my friends know my username.

General gist: I am a 21 year old university student in California, I currently have a software engineering internship (that ends until I graduate, Dec 2019) .

I racked up $12,000 in debt on 5 credit cards (most of their interest rates are around 12-17%), my brother helped me and lent me $5,900 over time to help pay them off, I also borrowed $1,000 from my boyfriend for the same reason. I also have $1,600 left to pay to T-Mobile for phones.

So in total, I have about $20,000 in debt.

I have tried to get loans to pay these off, but obviously, with the credit to debt ration literally being 101%, I am not eligible for any loans. Because of the debts, my credit is shot, went from 780 to 540. I am also not eligible for student loans (private or government) as my father earns a decent amount and I am still a dependent under him.

I have budgeted, and it worked, I kept on track but due to stress, school and work, I didn't always have time to look at it, so I easily get off track, and I easily return to the cycle of being behind payments and overspending.

I completely understand that this is my responsibility, and my goal is to pay it all off. I have been trying to work on it but it has resulted in me failing classes because of the stress (it does not help that I have an anxiety disorder and clinical depression) which pushed back my graduation 4 semesters in total. I also do have a bit of a spending problem due to the depression, as when I spend it alleviates it temporarily (which I understand is literally one of the worst problems to have when trying to un-debt myself).

Why am I here? I want a sense of direction, and to know if it even is realistically possible to expect to get out of this. I feel very overwhelmed, and as much as I hate it, I need someone to tell me what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I owe $20k, I have a stable job until graduation in a year, I have a spending problem, and I am anxious &amp; depressed. I want some pointers or direction to get this debt down.

personalfinance,"Just graduated college &amp; got a job, should I pay off my student loans all at once or over a year-ish period of time?","Hi everyone, this is my first post and just trying to get some additional opinions. So here's my situation:

I just graduated college in May with about $18,500 in Federally subsidized loans serviced through Nelnet which will stop being deferred in November (so soon!). I currently have enough saved up where I could comfortably pay it all off before interest even starts kicking in without worrying about falling behind on rent and whatnot.

To give reference to that statement, my current salary is about $93,000 but only $75,000 after taxes, insurances, and retirement. Therefore take-home is $4,200 a month and I'm still living like a college student lol. 

I really don't like being in debt, and it would make me feel way better to just pay these all off and be done with them. But a lot of people have told me to at least pay them off over a period of time (say a year) since interest rates on student loans are low. They say that this would help build my credit (current score is 661), but I feel like I could build my credit in other ways as well. And I don't plan on making a down payment on a house or other large expenses within the next year. So I guess I'm kinda wondering what you might do.

personalfinance,Are credit cards double charging interest?,"I never actually pay interest,  but I read capital one's. ""How we calculate interest "" section on my statement.  What a effing scam.

1) What they do is take your daily balance (yesterdays balance plus new charges minus payments) and each day they add a ""periodic interest amount"" to that balance.   (This interest is Very important) 

2)Then they total all those days and average that across the number of days in the month.  

3) Then they take your daily interest rate ( the apr you signed up for,  APR  divided by 365)  and they multiply your daily balance  by that daily interest number and multiply again by the number of days in the month.   Then u have your ""interest charge"" for the month. 

So basically what they have done is calculated interest on a daily balance that already had a ""periodic interest"" amount already applied to it,  in order to inflate the actual amount of interest you will pay.    That means that 21% apr that you signed up for,  that you already knew was a rip off, is actually a interest rate that you will never actually be able to achieve.

investing,Have we ever seen a huge blowout in real yields?,"Real bond yields have risen higher in the past year (after being negative for a long time). For people who don't know what this means, real yield is basically the rate of return on a bond vs. the rate of inflation. If real yields are negative, that means your money being parked in a bond or debt instrument is actually losing money to inflation if the real yield is negative.

Now, we've been in an environment where we've seen negative real yields for quite some time only for that to finally change in the last 1-2 years, but I'm kind of curious, have we ever seen an environment with extremely high real yields? I was trying to find some data on this but wasn't able to dig up much since the Fed's tracking of 5 year tips yields only goes back so far (a decent proxy for real yield).

I'm mostly curious because I tend to think if this were to occur, there may be a lot of really interesting consequences, and I was curious to see if history had any points of reference.

**And just a quick hypothetical as to why I'm curious here of consequences**

Just for reference, I'm not saying I think we'll see this happen, but there are a few scenarios out there that I think could potentially cause this even if they're not particularly likely. Those scenarios mostly being linked to the Chinese selling of their US treasury positions. Many people have brought up that they may do this as a weapon in the trade war. I think this has been largely debunked as suicidal for China. With that said, there is another scenario that would involve Chinese selling of US treasuries in volume which has already occurred in a minor fashion, that being to protect their currency. If we were to hypothetically see a Chinese monetary crisis, we would likely see China selling big chunks of their US treasury positions to defend and stabilize their currency. They did this in 2016, and have started doing it again recently. And no, it's not really a problem right now, but if there were hypothetically a full-blown currency crisis in China, we could get a really weird scenario where bond yields blow way higher in the USA without any actual inflation to go with it. Given, a full-blown Chinese currency crisis would cause a LOT more problems than just bond yields running higher in the USA, but it's still a really odd scenario that to me seems entirely plausible.

And since I know people will ask or comment on this, I'm not calling for a China currency crisis right now, but I do believe there is some potential for it to occur.",finance

personalfinance,401k Lump Sum vs Refinance Mortgage,"Hello Reddit community,

Sadly my father passed away last month... 
I am inheriting his 401k account of 80k. I have to pay off his reverse mortgage of 60k and I have 2 choices- 1) take the 401k lump sum payout 2) roll the 401k into an inherited IRA and withdraw over 5 years and get a new mortgage to refinance the reverse mortgage. 

I live in CA, currently file single, but am engaged and can get married at the courthouse before the end of the year in order to take advantage of the better tax brackets. I make 80k as a W2 employee.

After doing research, I feel taking the lump sum is the best and also easiest option. My dads home will not be my primary residence which limits my loan options and on top of that the loan will be small which limits my options even further. Perhaps do a HELOC? But I would be paying at least 9k in interest even if I pay it off in less than 10 years. The difference in tax brackets with the lump sum is going from 22% to 24% federal. CA bracket does not increase. So how much would I really be saving anyway by doing the inherited IRA 5 year route? 

Please give me your advice on what you would do in this situation.",finance

I have a friend who has offered to let me stay with her for the rest of high school rent free. If necessary, I have other friends I could stay with as well. For reference, I live in the Bay Area (CA). Here is my current plan:

Short Term: I have a little over $3000 saved up right now. Upfront costs are a car (will not be able to use my parents anymore) and first month's car insurance (\~$200). I currently work Friday, Saturday, Sunday at a restaurant (16-18 hours/$200 after taxes a week average) My current job pays minimum wage ($13.50/hr). I am currently applying to other jobs that would offer better benefits/college assistance/better pay. Once I move out I am thinking of working 6 days a week. Working \~35 hrs/wk at a job that pays above min wage would allow me to earn at least $2000/month after taxes. Note that I am underestimating my projected income and overestimating my expenses here to be safe. Monthly costs I will have to worry about include car insurance  (\~$200), gas  (\~$120), cell phone bill  (\~$30), and health insurance. Health insurance I am still looking into and learning about but if I understand correctly I will technically still be on my parents' plan until January 1. I looked at healthcare.gov and enrollment begins Nov 1 so I will apply when it opens.

Long Term: I'm applying to colleges both in state and out of state. I plan to go to college and earn a bachelor's in recreation and leisure studies with the end goal to becoming a park ranger. The money I begin saving now plus any scholarships or federal financial aid will go toward paying for college. Whatever I cannot pay for I will take out student loans.

Since I don't have much money saved, I plan to spend $2000 or less on a car. I realize that this plus insurance will leave me with less than $800, but I am doing this with the idea in mind that once I start working more hours (and hopefully at a job that pays more) I can earn the money back quickly and begin building my savings. I don't plan on spending any money on extras such as eating out or clothes until I have earned the money back and have a better idea of my adjusted income and monthly expenses. Does my plan seem okay or is it incredibly unreasonable? Are there any other expenses that I need to consider?

On another note, my teacher has advised me to get a credit card and buy something small (\~$10) every month and then pay back the money so that I can begin building my credit. She told me having a good credit score can help me get lower interest rates on student loans in the future. Is this a smart thing to do? I also don't know what credit card I should get. What are the pros/cons of a student vs secured card? I have a checking and savings account with a local credit union. Should I stick with my CU or is a big bank the better option for getting a credit card? What are the pros/cons of a CU vs a bank in general?

CryptoCurrency,Stablecoin Based on Bytom (BTM) – Some Thoughts,"In the recent [Bytom Global Dev Competition](https://bytom.io/developers_en/), some stablecoin projects have been seen. It is no surprise as stablecoin has been really a buzzword in the recent crypto market, and these projects are mulling over stablecoins based on Bytom Blockchain.

Stablecoins have been embroiled in controversies and they have been dissected and studied by some of the smartest minds in the cryptospace. This [article](https://www.8btc.com/article/280647) is going to do a deep dive on the buzzword stablecoin and visons about its design on Bytom.

**What is Stablecoin?**

The creation and development of stablecoins have a complicated history. We think it’s not necessary to present all of them, but it will be more interesting to introduce the concept with a short story.

&gt;*A primary school student named Leek would get some pocket money from his dad every day, while his dad did not allow him to use the money to play online games in internet cafés. Leek then came up with the idea that to use cigarettes as payment for internet access fees since the internet café owner likes smoking, and the owner agreed.*  
*The owner of the internet café later opened a cigarette store after realizing that lots of pupils used cigarette as their internet access fees, and announced only cigarettes bought from this store were accepted by his internet café.*  
*The business went quite well and seeing this, many cigarette shops were opened to sell cigarette to pupils. Though they tried hard to tout their products, they were not welcomed as they were not accepted by the internet café.*  
*Things began to change when Leek’s father found out all this. He reported the shop and asked local authority to strengthen regulations on it. To respond to that, the cigarette shop owner tried his best to win regulatory support and figured out an “acceptance dealer system” which allowed a few pupils to buy cigarettes in bulk and resell it to others. The internet café also opened a special transaction counter for the convenience of selling and buying among those pupils and charged some commission fee for it.*

The story stops here and let’s change the roles in it. In the cryptospace, Leek is those crypto investors, Leek’s father is the government, the internet café is those crypto exchanges like BitFinex and Gateio, the cigarette store is the issuer of stablecoin like Tether, and then cigarette is the stablecoin such as USDT or GUSD. Now we may have a basic understanding about the necessity and importance of stablecoins.

The value of the stablecoin at the current stage is mainly to act as a means of payment other than legal tender, to enable the transaction of cryptocurrency in situations where fiat money is not allowed. Created out of the market demand and regulations, stablecoins in itself can become a tool to accumulate wealth, and their issuers and crypto exchanges are going to benefit the most. In this aspect, government shall regulate the crypto market starting from the regulation on stablecoins.

Some expressed their concerns that dollar-backed stablecoins may have great impact on the international monetary and financial system; while in my view it is a gross exaggeration. Data shows that, USDT, which accounts for 87.33 percent of the stablecoin market share, currently has a market value of only $2.8 billion, with 24-hour trading volume at $3.3 billion (according to data collected from CoinMarketCap.com on Sep.26, 2018). For another, the international monetary and financial system is quite huge, compared to the $83.6 trillion in national money supply (according to HowMuch.net), the impact of the USDT on the monetary system is almost negligible. So at present, the impact of stablecoins is mainly confined to the cryptocurrency market.

**Visions about Stablecoin**

Following are some thoughts about stablecoin. First, a country can issue a stablecoin as a regulatory tool and see it as an exploration of digital currency; or explore the possibility of crypto-collateralized stablecoins.

1. **State-issued stablecoin**

A majority of the current stablecoins were issued by private individuals, but it is not ruled out that there will be stablecoins issued by a state in the future. If a stablecoin pegged to a certain legal tender (such as U.S. dollar and Chinese Yuan) is issued directly by a state, it would be truly stable. This kind of stablecoin is born with natural stability and the main concern about it is whether it will be accepted and massively adopted from the commercial aspect.

Imagine if a country uses a stablecoin as a regulatory means with KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regimes, it will be a gateway for the entire crypto market and the crypto market will be more controllable. The country will be able to know how new money flows into the crypto market. At the same time, the relationship between stablecoins and the existing fiat money can be eased. In this context, if a state-issued stablecoin is only to meet the demand of the crypto market, it will have no conflict with the existing monetary system.

2.**BTC-collateralized stablecoin**

Most current stablecoins are pegged to physical assets such as U.S. dollar. In the future, there may be currencies anchoring cryptos or tokens like bitcoin – some countries may issue fiat money backed by bitcoin. It’s a counterintuitive prediction because intuition tells us that bitcoin is a volatile asset. But I think it is exactly a trend in the future, a significant step for the crypto world to influence the atomic world.

Actually it’s not absolutely impossible. For one reason, more and more people want to fight against inflation via cryptocurrencies, especially those in Iran, Turkey, Venezuela, Argentina and Zimbabwe, suffering from economic and currency crises; for another, the fluctuation of bitcoin price has been seen the decrease at an annual rate of 25% since 2010.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Bitcoin price volatility has been decreasing year by year \(according to highchars.com\) ](https://i.redd.it/jhiqw1ddjvs11.png)

 

It is expectable that bitcoin would be a stable cryptocurrency in the far future. But why not directly use bitcoin as a payment means? As some users may still tend to use their own fiat money, and problems like congestion may emerge large on the bitcoin network along with the large volume transactions in the future. While the maturity of sidechain technologies could make stablecoin more advantageous. Therefore, there may come up a BTC-backed stablecoin.

**How to Create a Good Stablecoin?**

First of all, we need to get straight the function of a stablecoin. At present, stablecoins are a patch affiliated to traditional currencies to address specific problems in a certain sector. Precisely we should call stablecoin “pegged coin”, as **the value of a** **stablecoin is not that stable but fluctuates with the price of the peg**. Stablecoin have to accomplish two “leaps” to achieve the practical goal as a popular stablecoin.

The first leap is to technically achieve anchoring to real-world assets, by building reserve mechanism, algorithm regulation and interest rate adjustment. There have been many articles about the stablecoin mechanism. I will not go into details here, but recommend *A History of Stablecoins* to you. In summary, it mainly focuses on “decentralization”, “usability”, “stability”.

Centralized stablecoins like USDT are easy to use and stable, but lack in decentralization. Decentralized stablecoins, such as BitUSD (a crypto-collateralized stablecoin), are featured by a high degree of decentralization, but its stability is greatly affected by fluctuations of the collateral.

The second leap is to commercially achieve mass adoption. Only when a stablecoin is widely adopted, could it have values. Currently stablecoins faces the influence from government policies, acceptance of exchanges, the prosperity of C2C (customer-to-customer transaction) market and other commercial factors.

**Stablecoins Based on Bytom**

Bytom is a public blockchain dedicated to asset blockchainization, and stablecoins are in fact a part of the blockchainization of “currency” asset. Stablecoins based on Bytom will have three advantages:

1. Based on the BUTXO model (Bytom Unspent Transaction Output) and sidechain
2. Based on the system of asset blockchainization
3. Based on the national cryptographic standards

1. **Based on the BUTXO model (Bytom Unspent Transaction Output) and sidechain**. The UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model is the underlying data structure of bitcoin blockchain, featured by safety, stability and extensibility. However, the current stablecoins market is overwhelmed with tokens based on the account model of Ethereum, lacking stablecoins based on UTXO architecture. In my view, the model architecture based on UTXO is the future trend, because the tokens with asset attributes, especially stablecoins, require the most secure data storage structure. The decade bitcoin being around is a decade of tremendous stability and security, and a stablecoin based on the UTXO model will also have this trait.  Bytom’s extended UTXO architecture can unify all kinds of stablecoins into a blockchain. As you can imagine, stablecoins backed by U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollar and euro can all be on a public chain.

&amp;#x200B;

[ A stablecoin system based on BUTXO ](https://i.redd.it/9opp4z0ijvs11.png)

 2. **Based on the system of asset** **blockchainization**. Asset blockchainization is a systematic job as we elaborated in the [serial articles](https://news.8btc.com/asset-blockchainization-on-bytom-v-cognitive-dimensions-of-migrating-asset-onchain). 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Six major systems of asset blockchainization ](https://i.redd.it/2hdr9seljvs11.png)

 

Taking the onchain identity system for example, there must be an identity system behind stablecoins. Imagine we have a Chinese yuan-pegged stablecoin, when we obtain all accounts related to CNY, we need to go through the procedures of KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering). However, the account system on blockchain is mostly based on public key or private key, so it needs to build a layer of account system on the top layer to match that of the real world. By building tools such as distributed identity and blockchain contract, Bytom builds an identity system on the blockchain to provide underlying support for the stablecoin. This is also something that most underlying public chains cannot make or have not focused on.

3. **Based on the “national cryptographic standard”**. In the narrow sense, the national cryptographic standard refers to “the public-key cryptography algorithm 2 based on M2 elliptic curve and SM3 cryptography hashing algorithm 3”, two pieces of standards deemed as domestic cryptography algorithm by the State Bureau of Cryptography Administration. It will enable Bytom to be friendly to domestic standards in terms of security. Broadly defined, the national cryptographic standard means that Bytom is a public chain protocol with Chinese elements. In the exploration for the development of state-issued digital currency and the creation of a stablecoin, we need to take Chinese elements into consideration. After all, codes have no national boundary, but the currency has its nationality.

IDENTIFY: I identified this market as CHFJPY is at a key support and the market forming a double bottom pattern at weekly support.

JPY is also seeing some weakness partly due to the USD strength with the FOMC meeting minutes confirming the plan to hike rates. 

PLAN: Ideally we want to see the market take out the previous highs sitting at 113.70. If the market creates a higher high here we can look for the neckline to be tested to add in to our current position. 

TRADE: I have taken a position at the support level after it formed a bullish candle. This shows that a double bottom could be forming. Stops below the support zone with targets over 3:1 reward to risk.",finance

This is on mobile and my head is all over the place so sorry in advance for mistakes. I had a bank account with Bank of America. Sometime last year an associate of mine said his cousin could get me a loan and that I would have to pay him every month with no interest rate. Mind you I was 18 at the time and stupid of course.  He said his cousin could lend me money into my account. Turns out it’s was a scam and fraudulent checks..

Well I freaked out because I took the money out of my account a day later and the bank closed my account for fraud. I never went back and said it wasn’t me who did it and I was scared of the consequences. So I left the account as it was and thought I would be okay.. Turns out i owe them money and had to pay after trying to open up an account with a different bank. So I go ahead almost 8 months later and talk to the bank so I can clear this fraud off of my social security. They said pay what you owe and you can open up an account. I finally paid what I owed which was 2k and they told me to wait a month to process.

I waited a month, went back to Bank of America to open the account and they rejected me. Even though I paid the full amount I am still under “High Risk” fraud and cannot open an account with them or any other bank for 5 YEARS. I felt devastated and my heart sank because this wasn’t my fault. I got tricked into a scam at a stupid age and now I cannot go to college or try to build credit/get a car.. 

All I’m asking is for advice on what to do since I am in such a cluster fuck at the moment. Please anyone just tell me how to go about this?

So like if you make 30k a year, your taxed on 18k (12k standard tax deduction), than subtract 9k, so your only taxed on 9k for the year.  So your fed taxes are somthing like 900 that year, so youd save something like 2k in reality?  (Loose math)..

The big things to take note of hear is I would be purchasing the solar panels, not leasing, just financing them, over most likely a 20 year loan.

I understand that there is a $2500 AGI reduction on interest payments to help offset this, but has there ever been an initiative to put something like this into law?  Am I just crazy?  I think I paid somewhere around $5-6k in interest over the past few years (EACH year) and it just drives me bonkers knowing this.

I want to be able to pay this loan off as efficiently as possible so that my money being paid toward it actually hits the principle.

Refinancing appears to only offer me an interest rate change down to around 12.9% assuming I also lessen the term as well.

personalfinance,Need help deciding what do do with my Federal Retirement Account,"Hey all,

So here's the story.  I worked as a federal employee for 4 years and then left the organization for greener pastures.  While employed you automatically contribute to a pension program called ""FERS"".  After 5 years you are vested and upon reaching the age of 62 you will start to draw an annuity based on your years of service and FERS amount.  If you leave before 5 years that money will sit in the Federal Governments hands and gain interest at the G Fund rate (about 2.3-3.0% annually).  The kicker is that you can withdraw it if you want and only pay taxes on the accrued interest from the time of separation (in this case about 2 years).

If you ever decide to go back to federal service and you haven't touched the FERS amount then you will start back right where you left off.

If I cashed my FERS in, I'd get about $8500 in cash money.

I currently have about $3000 in student debt that I accrued from taking a certification course (which led to a new job and a $10,000/year pay raise *salary now being 90k/year).

Other than that debt I have a car payment, and a house payment.  No credit card debt and contributing about 10k/year to my 401k.

I was thinking about withdrawing that money, paying off the debt, getting my home office setup (about 2k) (the new job is remote) and then depositing the rest into my vanguard fund.

I was hoping to get some advice on whether or not this is a good move.  I suppose I don't really NEED the money, but if I could cut that debt out and get the office done without money out of pocket I could really kick up my 401k contributions and get closer to that maxing out.

I don't ever plan on returning to federal service (and if I did, I COULD buy the time back but with the interest I would've earned while I was out)  I have 6k set aside in an emergency fund and am slowly getting our house setup (just finished renovating the whole thing out of pocket) so purchases right now are pretty frequent while we get new furniture, decorations, etc.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated

However, Prodigy is offering me a loan for 80% of my total requirement at a 8.31% interest rate (fixed margin (5.90%), plus variable 3 Month USD LIBOR - currently 2.41%). I feel that the interest rate is quite high.

My uncle, who is a US citizen and is a business owner with excellent credit rating, is willing to sign on as a cosigner for my loan. I was wondering if I could get a better interest rate and possibly a higher loan amount if I go this route.
Could someone please point towards any resources (possible interest rate, reliable loan providing banks/companies, etc.) that would help me? Also, if anyone has experience getting a loan through a US cosigner who can give me tips, it would be highly appreciated.
Cheers!",finance
Bitcoin,How Prices are Formed - We All Seem to be Confused,"I've been perusing the sub lately, and I see people debating about how the price of Bitcoin is generated. People are getting into arguments saying that scarcity generates the price, and others saying that the inherent value of Bitcoin determines its price.

This is insane and it needs to be cleared up. If you'd like to learn more, beyond what I write here, check out the millions of free hours of lectures, videos, articles, and books available at [Mises.org](https://mises.org/)

What I write will be a rather crude representation of very detailed ideas that you can learn more about at Mises.org.

***1) Nothing has inherent value.***

Sorry, inherent value doesn't exist. 

Humans flush shit down the toilet, while flies swim to it for a buffet (to further prove the point, research ""nightsoil""); 

Drawing modern-day hentai-porn takes just about as much effort as the original painting of Mona Lisa, yet one sells for millions while the other is available for free online; 

Up until as late as 150 years ago, one of the most valuable things to our economy today - oil - was seen as a horrific nuisance. Farmers would wake up one day and have black goo ruin their crops and they wouldn't be able to sell their farms because no one wanted it - their lives were ruined. Now, decade-long wars are fought for control over it;

Water is the most important substance on the planet for life, yet giant cities with millions of people are built in deserts and the stuff is handed out for free, and even pumped full of chlorine and used in fountains.

Nothing has inherent value.

***2) All value is subjective.***

All value is in the eye of the beholder.

This is a loaded statement and has a lot of information packed into it, so let's break it down into a few sub-sections

**2.A.) Humans have goals**

Humans have goals - they recognize that their lives could be better in the future than it is now, and they can contemplate a way to achieve that better life.

*2.A.a) This means time exists and it moves forward*

If our lives suck now, and we can imagine - and actually accomplish - a way to make it better, then time must exist.

*2.A.b) This means that ""things now"" are more valuable than ""things later""*

No one wants to have a shitty life at any point of their life. Thus, ending suffering immediately - or pre-emptively avoiding suffering - is preferred to ending suffering later

(Psst: this is why ""loans"" and ""interest rates"" exist)

**2.B) Not everyone's goals are the same**

Many of our goals are the same, but not all of them. Some people desire to become gods of the universe, some just want to make cartoons for a living, and others would rather be non-stop strung out on drugs.

*2.B.b) People can trade! (Provided private property exists)*

If we all have different tastes, then I don't mind giving you a peanut butter sandwich in exchange for a turkey one. Children will begin trading after Trick-Or-Treat because Sally likes Twix, while Jimmy likes Kit-Kats. 

Trading can only happen when the parties involved both agree to do so. It is, per se, always viewed as profitable before the trade happens. ***Barring fraud and horrible accidents, everyone always benefits from voluntary trade by definition.*** This is why socialism ALWAYS fails. Sorry, kids: Socialism IS death.

*2.B.b.a) Trading is difficult*

If you have a chicken, and want pickles, you're a chicken-having-pickle-wanter. You'll need to find someone with pickles who wants chickens, a pickle-having-chicken-wanter. (Thanks to Walter Block for this fun phrase)

This is difficult and really stifles the development of an economy. How many farmers need A.I. technologies for Google Cloud Services? None, that's how many. Thus, A.I. can't be developed because the programmers would starve (or, at least, there would be a strong incentive to NOT be a programmer). 

*2.B.b.a.a) A common medium of exchange facilitates trade*

Money makes trading easier! People have goals, and so do other people, but their goals might not correlate and so countless professions are unsustainable. People eventually see that they can obtain these other professions if they simply create a local medium of exchange (money). Everyone is better off with money.

*2.B.c) People's goals and desires are revealed through action, not speech.*

Liars exist. People might say they want to be the world's best Oncologist, but they spend all their time playing League of Legends. It sucks, but, the person reveals that, indeed, they want to vegetate in front of their computer.

**Bitcoin's Subjective Value comes from the fact that PEOPLE WITH THE GOAL OF HAVING STABLE MONEY OBSERVE THAT (a) money can be used to ease trade, (b) paper monies are completely controlled by sadistic megalomaniacs, (c) precious metals are too heavy and difficult to hide to travel around the globe easily, (d) and Bitcoin is a money that doesn't have these problems. Thus, the goal of having a stable, free, uncontrolled, worldwide money can be accomplished via Bitcoin. THIS is why Bitcoin has VALUE - people GIVE it value via its ability to help them achieve their goals.**

***3) Value alone doesn't generate prices - It takes two to tango***

Prices are generated via a sort of auction system. If I have a tomato, I can go to a market and start yelling that I want to sell a tomato. The people in the market who view the tomato as a means to achieve their goals will then begin bidding on how much to pay for the tomato.

As they bid, the bidders one by one drop out as the price becomes too high for them. 

***4) Many products are fungible***

When you buy 3 turkey sandwiches from the same store in the same order, they're largely the same. Even though the lettuce on each sandwich might have come from different heads of lettuce, the onion slices might have come from different onions, the tomato slices might have come from different tomatoes, the bottle of oil or mayo might have run out half way through the second sandwich and had to be replaced by another bottle, or the person making one sandwich might have been different from the person making the other sandwiches...

...they're still pretty much the same sandwiches. 

They're fungible.

**4.A) We use products for what we think are our most important goals first.**

If you're on a small island alone, and you know you'll be saved in a week, and you have 20 gallons of water, you'll put aside 10 gallons (or so) for drinking, and use the rest for bathing, watering plants, or whatever else.

However, if a storm comes through and destroys 5 of the 10 gallons you set aside for drinking (so now you have 5 for drinking, and 10 for ""other""), you don't have to worry about dehydration. You'll just reassign 5 of the ""other"" water gallons into ""drinking"" gallons. After all, they're all fungible, and 'watering plants' is a less important goal than 'drinking and living'. 

(Thus, disasters are NOT good for the economy)

*4.A.a) The more we have of something, the less each individual thing is worth to us*

If you only really ""need"" 5 pencils for the year, and you ""want"" an emergency 10 pencils just in case... but you have 500 pencils, then you won't even bother to pick up a pencil if you drop it on the floor. Why bother? You'd have to go through 2 every day to actually be worried about running out.

Indeed, after the first 100 pencils, they're largely a nuisance. Thus, pencils #101 through #500 are pretty much worthless to you.

However, your neighbors might need some pencils, so you'd be willing to sell them. Even though the pencils are worthless to you, your neighbors are willing to bid up the price to buy them off you.

***This is why ""Greater Supply leads to Lower Prices"" -- If all 30 people in your neighborhood only need/want 20 pencils each, but you have 50,000,000 of them to sell, people don't need to bid very high to convince you to sell one***. Hell, you might just give them out for free.

--------------------------------------------------------

We've literally just used the phrase ""people have goals and act to achieve them"" to deduce the laws of Supply and Demand.

This is how the price of everything is determined: you have more of something than you feel you need, and you're willing to trade the left-over things for something else; AND someone else wants that thing, and is willing to trade FOR the left-over things with his something else. 

**A price is NOTHING more than ""What someone is willing to give you for whatever it is that you own"". **

* There's no ""advanced market analysis class"" that can predict what the price will be.

* Just because there are only 21 million BTC doesn't mean that each coin will be worth billions of dollars.

* Just because the miner-reward will drop by half does NOT MEAN that the price HAS to increase. 

* Just because Bitcoin achieves a goal that people want doesn't mean that everyone will go bankrupt trying to acquire it.

The amount of Bitcoin is the amount of Bitcoin, and people with goals will assign a value to it, and this value will run into other people's valuation of it, which will eventually, on an open, free market, generate a price of it.

------------------------------------

Again, if you want to learn how REAL economics works, or just get your teeth whet, hop over to [Mises.org](https://mises.org/) where you can learn economics in EASY TO UNDERSTAND terms.

If it weren't for Ron Paul waking me up in 2007 and pointing me to [Mises.org](https://mises.org/) and Austrian Economics, I wouldn't have ever thought about Bitcoin as anything serious.

personalfinance,Credit card raised interest rate to 32% - should I take a loan out to close this card?,"Hi guys, I made a recent post about my new finances. I finally got a permanent job and am going through all of my financial items. I have noticed one of my credit cards raised the APR to almost %32. I owe $6600 on this card. With a repayment calculator I found that if I pay $300 a month it will be repaid in 34 months (not sure if correct). A personal loan through my credit union would be %9 and I'm wondering if that's the best route as I am now reading this bank is a predatory lender. Or would it be best to aggressively pay down and do some balance transfers to other cards? Btw my credit score is good. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,I don't understand my student loans. [screenshot],"Hello reddit! This is my first time posting on r/personalfinance and I'm hoping someone can offer some clarity on what's going on. Here's a screenshot of what I owe in student loans, how much I've paid, interest rate, etc.
https://imgur.com/a/awnAndz

My problem is that I don't understand how the numbers add up. It says I've accrued about $7k in interest, and I've made $7k in payments (99% of which has gone to interest), so how come my current balance is about $15k higher than when I started? 

My situation: 
I'm currently on an income-based plan, but because my last year's income was so low, my payments are $0/month. This year I started making about $80k/year, and my cost of living is about $24k/year. It's very likely that I'll continue to make $80k/year for the next 2 years, and my cost of living will stay the same, or decrease. 

My questions: 
1) How does $7k accrued interest + $7k in payments = $15k ADDED to my current balance?

2) Am I accruing interest every month even though my payment is $0? How can I find out exactly how much interest I'm accruing every month?

3) If I make payments now while the total due is $0/month, will that amount go towards interest, or principal? 

4) What would you do if you were in my situation? Pay the loan as you go? Save a big chunk and make a large payment? Run away to Mexico?

In a nutshell: I'm trying to avoid having my lump payments to go towards interest, but that's hard when I can't even make sense of the numbers in front of me.

TL;DR: Numbers are hard.",finance

personalfinance,Underwater on a car that needs constant repairs,"Hello everyone! Some advice would be greatly appreciated. About two years ago I leased a 2011 VW GTI with 120,000 miles on it. In retrospect I got a shit deal on the car, I leased it for around $10,000 and a $3000 warranty was thrown on totaling to $13,000. It’s a 54 month lease with an interest rate of about 6.2%. 

My monthly payments are $276 a month which is perfectly manageable for me, the problem comes however with the fact that as my job as a pizza delivery driver it’s put a lot of wear and tear on the car. Just this year alone I’ve spent around $3500 in maintenance and repairs. Since I don’t make enough to cover all this I’ve had to put about $1500 of it on my credit card. Even though I purchased a warranty it wasn’t able to cover any of the expenses. The warranty stated that it was valid for 3 years or 36,000 miles whichever came first, the miles came first. I kid you not 200 miles after that mark that’s when the problems started.

KBB has the value of the car at around $3000 but I still owe $8000. This past year has been very stressful with the almost monthly repairs and what it is doing to me financially. I would really like to trade it in for something more reliable but I know that $5000 difference will added onto whatever I lease next. What are y’alls recommendations? Thank you!

Edit: I forgot to add that the car has 175,000 miles on it now. With all the repairs and stuff, it’s more like I’m paying $625 a month, not $276.

personalfinance,"Just finished a chase auto loan, would it be wise to apply for a personal loan if at all possible?","I have a few credit cards I would like to combine into one payment because the interest is crazy. I am just trying to pay them off. I bank with Chase and my aunt bought my car with me as a co-signer. The loan appeared on my credit and just last month the loan is complete and the account has closed in my credit report. There was never a missed or late payment on the car. 

I want to just pay off these three cards and have one monthly payment instead of three interest rates.. it totals out to be about $4,000. Nothing too terrible. So essentially i'd be looking for a loan of $4,000. My question is, if my credit score is bad (I am working on it. I had a bad hit the last couple of months and it's gonna take me a while to get back up) but I did have a positive experience with their auto loan. Would they take that into consideration or do you think my credit score being in the 520 range give me an automatic denial? The loan was through Chase auto and I've been a customer of chase for 7 years now.

personalfinance,Budgeting and Tax Returns in 2019,"I've typically itemized in recent years and it's been normal for me to get about $2000 back on my tax returns.  As it's been consistent, I actually started putting it into my budget calculations.

Now with the new tax laws and expecting to take the standard deduction, I'm thinking I may get nothing back in 2019.  I didn't notice at the time but it does appear that less has been taken out of my paychecks this year.

Does this sound correct or am I missing something?  Subtracting that $2000 out of my budget would be pretty massive.  I might have to reconsider some of my expenses.

If anyone else is counting on a tax return like I was, you might need to re-evaluate things.


Edit: Few additional details - Single - 2 withholdings for Federal.  It looks like my taxable gross income will end up being $83035 and my federal taxes taken out will be $11567.

personalfinance,Refinance $21000 3.78% variable student loan with 3.89% fixed loan?,"Hi PF,

Long time listener, first time caller. I'm wondering if the community can provide some advice on whether to pay off my student loan faster or honestly start saving to buy a house.

I originally refinanced the remaining balance of my student loan with SoFI back in November 2017. This was for about $29,000 at 3.165 variable for 5 years. The minimum payment is about $400 per month but I typically pay between $700-900 in an effort to become fully debt free.

Recently with the interest rates on the rise, the rate has increased to 3.78% and I've been looking into refinancing with a fixed rate plan. After some digging, I have the opportunity to refinance $21,000 at 3.89% fixed for 5 years.

Two questions: Is it worth it to refinance the remaining $21,000 at 3.85? Also, should I continue to overpay the loan in an effort to pay it off faster, or should I pay the minimum and start building up my cash pile to hopefully buy a house one day. As a side note, I already max out my 401k and Roth contributions annually.

personalfinance,"New to finances, might have made a mistake...","Quick summary, I earn ~$40,000/yr at a tech company with no chance of growth.

Now to my bad decision:

I cashed out my 401k (~$3k) from my last job in order to take off two other lines of credit I had ($800 ~25%apr and $1200 ~20%apr)
Along with padding my savings for between jobs ( I just started my new one this week.)

EVERYONE with ZERO exceptions has called this a bad move. I am wondering why. 

My justification: The taxes were taken off the top, big deal. I took a loss to improve my credit for soon-to-be car loan and applying for apartments. I also have a Roth IRA and life insurance along with a varied portfolio through a third party investment firm to which I contribute monthly.

My question is why is this such a bad idea? And either way, what should be my next steps to grow my savings and improve credit?

Please try to forgive my ignorance.

personalfinance,Need some advice for a sticky situation,"Hey PF, first time poster on the forum hoping for some advice about how to handle my current situation.  


The numbers:  
Age: 24  
Debt: \~$5,500  
Age of debt: \~3 years (in collections for a bit over two years now)  
Credit score: \~550  
Savings: \~$3,000 (not including 401k)  
Income: \~$120,000/yr  
Expenses: really low now, I moved back in with my parents a month ago  


The story:  
A few years ago when I was young and had no idea what I was doing when it came to finance, I ended up being offered a credit card with way too high of a limit for my age due to my income being high. I ended up hitting my minimum for points purposes but in retrospect that was a terrible idea and was one of the factors that led to the situation I'm in now. Now I'm a few years down the road and recently moved out of SF where most of my income was going to rent every month (and is still going until next month due to my lease agreement). Part of me felt like I could just ignore the debt but the stress of knowing it's there has been eating away at me.   


I recently moved back in with my parents in hopes of saving more to be able to pay this down but due to living in the suburbs and not having a car (I work remotely from home) this has also become detrimental to my mental health. I'm hoping to buy a car (less than $5k, just an old SUV that's sturdy enough to make it through mountain roads this winter without repairs every few weeks) to help alleviate the stress of being stuck inside alone, and at home all the time, ideally sooner rather than later.  


The questions:  
At this point does the immediacy with which I pay the debt back actually matter?  
Should I take out a loan from somewhere like One Main to pay this off immediately? I know the interest rate will be insane given my credit score but if I wait for my savings to come in it'll be another month or so before I'm able to pay it off (and that means a major delay in buying a car which I'm not sure I can afford given my mental health status and history, and the situation I'm in being stuck at home 24/7)  
Do you think it's possible for me to get a loan from my credit union at a lower interest rate given that they're usually more understanding of situations like this than big lenders? Is it even worth trying?  
Is there anything I can do to rebuild my credit score more quickly given that it'll be nearly impossible for me to get any sort of lending in the near future?",finance

stocks,The end of the cycle?,"With all this talk about the markets being near the end of the cycle, or as Ray Dalio likes to say ""We're in the 7th inning"" it has me wondering.. If we are indeed at the end of a cycle in the market, how bad will the drop be? Let's take a few major indices for example, Dow and S&amp;P. Could the DOW fall into the 22,000 territory or lower? Could the S&amp;P drop 15-20% in the next 6-12 months? I mean some really big economic minds and financial heavyweights make it sound like 2008 all over again, but where would that be coming from? Interest rates are proportioned well to the market I believe and the economy itself is extremely strong. I don't get the feeling banks are being 2008 level ignorant in their lending, so if the cycle is coming to an end the drop surely won't be anywhere near as bad as 2008 right?

&amp;#x200B;

On a side note, I'm pretty exposed to China and needless to say my past few months haven't been so great. Shanghai Comp and Hang Seng are having their worst years since the financial crisis all because China's GDP is at 6.6% a year which is insane to think of as a negative and the tariffs which I think are completely priced in the two markets. What scares me is the thought of that falling even further if the US market takes a major tumble soon, but I really don't think that would be warranted at this point. I know the two markets (China and US) have moments were they correlate, but I can't imagine the US market taking that big of a hit. In general the Chinese markets (Shanghai and Hang Seng) have been much more volatile in the past.

personalfinance,Continue to save for house down-payment or pay off large chunk of student loans?,"So I'm currently on maternity leave, due 10/22, just sitting around waiting for this baby boy to pop out and taking stock of our current financial situation to figure out next steps. Note: I'm not planning to implement any major decisions until I'm done with maternity leave (6-8 weeks depending on type of delivery) and have at least one month back at work to settle into our new situation.

Living situation: Married, I am primary earner in the household, my husband has not been working and will be a stay-at-home-dad so there's no lost income on that front. We're located in the Central Valley, California, renting 3 bed/2 bath house.

Emergency fund: $15,000.

Currently contributing to 401K at 6% (employer matches 100% up to 4%), as well as 457b at 6% for a total of 12% pre-tax income going toward retirement. No IRA currently.

Budget

Net pay post-tax, post-insurance, post-retirement is $6,800 monthly (paid biweekly $3,400)

Rent: $1325

Car: $550 (0% APR)

Student loan payment: $600

Electric: Avg $300

Water: Avg $30

Gas: Avg $20

Trash: $55

Internet: $80

Phones: $85

Landscaping: $120

Which brings me to the crux of my question. Prior to getting pregnant, we had been saving for a down payment on a house and currently have $20,000 saved up. We previously thought we'd be okay putting down 5-10% and we were intending to buy within a year from now. However, we're now leaning toward saving the tried-and-true 20% and we're skeptical of the current market. Specifically, my husband is worried about us buying now and then having a recession hit in the next 2-3 years (I'll admit, I'm not well versed on economic trends and I don't know how valid this concern is). For context, we're planning to buy a house similar to what we're renting which would be $250-300k in this area.

We also have student loans, approx $48,000 all together with interest rates that vary from 3.15% to 6.55%, I believe 3/4 of the loans are above 4%. Per the prime directive, we should focus on getting these loans paid off, which is what I'm aiming for now. Before sitting down and thinking this over, we had wanted to focus our efforts on saving more for a house and continuing to pay our regular payment on the loans, but after discussing with husband we would both be more comfortable getting rid of all the student debt first. And we're wanting to use that $20,000 we have saved to shave off a solid chunk of the loans, putting us back to square one on a down payment.



I'm looking for thoughts from others to make sure this is the best decision or if there's other options that would make more sense.

Follow up stupid question: What are the logistics of paying off student loans from a savings account? Can I call the loan servicer and set up a payment straight from the account via the account and routing number? If anyone has done this, I'd love to hear about it.



TL;DR Have $20,000 saved. Continue to hold onto it and save for down payment on house ($50-60k), or use it to blow large chunk out of student loans?",finance
personalfinance,Offered 40k salary from 14.50/h,"Basically I am going from a linecook to some type of (kitchen)? (complete job description isn't clear yet)""manager"" role but most likely will be a linecook majority of the time til they open a new restaurant which I am guessing I will take over in a managerial position.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've googled 40k is amazing for linecooks, but its lower end for managers.

&amp;#x200B;

I was considering counter offering for like 2.5k more or should I ask for more? or is 40k good?

&amp;#x200B;

currently I am usually scheduled for 40h/week and get cut right at or right before the 40 mark. This was not the case during the season (march to pretty much late august I was working minimum 80h weeks) 6 days a week. (keep in mind this was a new restaurant and were understaffed majority of the season)

&amp;#x200B;

From a mathematical sense even considering overtime (if my math is right) yearly I would make more being on salary.

&amp;#x200B;

14.50x40(hours)(580)x4(weeks)(2320)x12(months)=27,840 before taxes. Then consider march to august (roughly 6months)with OT which lets consider 30-40hours $652.5-$870 times 4(weeks) times 6(months) $15,660-$20,880 pay in OT

&amp;#x200B;

So roughly I make the 27,840 yearly IF 40/h then on top of that maybe 6months OT in the range of 15-20k which puts us me at 43,500-48,500.

&amp;#x200B;

I doubt these crazy hours will happen again, but who knows. I figure my newer role will be ""easier"" in terms of work comparatively to what I currently do but I enjoy what I do and don't ever really see it as work, and more as a consumption of time.

&amp;#x200B;

If I consider the usual time headchef/souschef spend in kitchen (now) based off of current work schedule which is 5 days a week and 10-11/h days and usually they alternate one will come in at 11 instead of 8-9 then go to closing which is usually around 1030-11.

&amp;#x200B;

With 3 of us this shift would potentially lower overall hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Based off a 40k salary I make more money as long as I do not go over 23h/OT per week during season.

&amp;#x200B;

also we should be getting benefits soon I think which should make the deal more shiny right? I am completely new to the idea/thought of it but from what I think remembering reading off other posts salary+benefits usually outweighs whatever OT I might be getting.

personalfinance,Mortgage Points vs. Credits. What's Going on Here?,"Below, I put the info from section VII ""Details of Transaction"" from the Uniform Residential Loan Application form given to us to sign by our lender. I'm wondering if anyone can help me understand me what is going on here. I'm in the US and under contract to purchase a home trying to get a mortgage, and I was offered a 5.00% rate from this lender. However, I can see that they are buying a point to lower the interest rate, which he didn't tell me about. My question is how exactly is he doing it? We have seller concessions for closing of 3%, which you can see is for some reason in the ""Other Credits"" instead of the ""Borrower's closing costs paid by seller."" I do see that the ""Borrower's closing costs paid by seller"" includes a $1,100 that I know nothing about, and in addition to the ""Title Adjustment"" credit, it adds up to just about the exact cost of the point. I don't know where either of those two credits are coming from though. Is the mortgage company basically giving me credits to offset to cost of the point, or is something else going on? I'm not crazy about him not telling me the base rate was 5.25% regardless of how he got it to 5.00%, which makes me suspicious. Thanks for your help.

I'm decently qualified for my industry and working on a few master's degrees. I figured I could get a job fairly quickly, and could live off of the money I had saved. I didn't adjust my lifestyle, thinking that my unemployment was going to be short. Eventually, I gave up looking in favor of Uber and holding out for a more specific job. From May-ish to September, I began struggling to pay my bills, and consistently missed payments on everything but my student loans, which I put into deferment. I finally started a job in the first week of September in the industry I want to work in, and my take home each month is $4,837.

personalfinance,(NO) Please rate our 5 year plan to financial independence.,"Good morning.

I sat down 2 days ago with my girlfriend and made a 5 year plan. Using the resources, advises and experienced gathered from lurking on this forum.

I would like your judgement on this plan, what can we do better, and what pitfalls we should look out for on this road.

This as been a long time coming, and I feel great finally taking the time to plan this out.

I am 29 and my girlfriend is 24.We live in Norway, Things are more expensive here then in the US. but wages are also higher, employee protection is extremely good, and socialized healthcare is close to free (so there is no need for health insurance, tough it is smart to get extra insurance in the future).

1.000 Nok = 120 USD10.000 Nok = 1.200 USD etc.

BSU = Tax free savings program for young people to buy there first property. (covers the down payment).You can save up to 25.000 Nok in a year, and in return you get 5.000 Nok of your taxes that year, paid back directly into that savings account. + 3,35 % interests.  - this savings account is available until the end of the year you turn 33.

Income:I make min 30.000 after taxes per. month. - Up to 40.000 with Overtime. - Yearly pay raise incoming 1st of Jan.My girlfriend makes 10.000 after taxes per month. - Currently looking for better employment.

Debt:My student loans: 41.000 Nok - 1% interests - 1.700 nok p. month. - This is in another country and therefore costs transfers fees every time I pay them off.Her student loans: 55.000 Nok - 2% interests - 1.000 nok p.m.Main car: 800.000 Nok - 2,5% interests - 8.000 nok p.m    - This car is my pride and joy and I will not sell it.It's also electric which makes it exempt from yearly fees and road tolls that could reach up to 1.500 p.m. when I drove a gasoline car. + I charge the car for free at work.Second car: 40.000 Nok - 4,5% interests - 1.500 nok p.mRefinance loan: 150.000 Nok - 10% interests - 4.000 nok p.mCredit card and small credit loans: 10.000 Nok - 1.000 nok p.m

Total debt: Just shy of 1.100.000 Nok. or 134.000 USD.

&amp;#x200B;

Our plan:(note: I am not counting in this the upcoming pay raise, and not the quarterly bonuses / Stock vesting.I am using that as my buffer to make this work even if some surprise expenses come up)

**Step 1** \- Make a budget.Rent &amp; Kindergarten  8.100Groceries  5.000Utilities  3.500 (this includes Electricity, Phones, Internet and Insurance)Debts &amp; Loans min payments 16.000Personal expenses  4.000

Total: 36.600

Income: 40.000 - 50.000 (depending on overtime)

Leftovers:  3.400 - 13.400

I am counting on an average of 10.000 Nok. leftover p.m. since I fill up my OT limit more often than not.I also have the pay raise and quarterly bonuses to fill the gab if needed.

**Step 1.5**Sell second car and fully pay the loan.ETC: As soon as f-ing possible.

Step 2 - Get started on savingsGet joint savings account to 30.000Get BSU account to 25.000 (move all savings to BSU in December 2018 to try to reach 25.000)

Starting with 10.000 each month ETC around March 2019.

**Step 3** \- Increase savings and start on pension.Once Emergency savings and BSU is secure, increase employee pension match to the max 7%.ETC: March 2019

Get another 25.000 into BSU. w. the 10.000. (total of 50.000 now for this year, as we are 2 persons).ETC: June 2019

**Step 4** \- Dept payments.Pay credit card and other credit dept. Around 10.000 dept w. 1.000 payments. + 10.000 snowball.ETC: July 2019

Pay my student loans, around 25.000 dept w. 1.500 payments + 11.000 snowball.(I want to get this away fast, even tough it has the lowest interest rate, due to it being in my old home country and I want to be fully released from that place)ETC: Sep 2019

Pay Refinance loan. Around 100.000 by now w. 4.000 payments + 12.000 snowball.ETC: April 2020

**Step 5** \- Max out BSU and emergency savings.Get another 25.000 into the BSU to get the full yearly benefit. w. 16.000 snowball.ETC: June 2020

Increase Emergency savings from 30.000 to 100.000 w. 16.000 snowball.ETC: November 2020

Main car loan 600.000 dept by now w. 8.000 in payments + 17.000 snowball.(not sure if we do this or just keep paying it down normally).ETC: March 2023 if we chose to do this.

**Step 7** – Buy a house.ETC: Early 2023  – this is when my BSU is checked out, but my spouse could keep saving 25.000 a year until start of 2028.Monthly payments of houses are around 10-12.000 in the current market, which would affect the early payments of the car.

**Step 8**. - Savings, Savings, Savings.Increase savings and pension.Start saving for personal goals, like a hoppy car and overseas trips.

**Step 9**. -  2023 and onwardsInvest in mutual funds.Maybe even start a FU savings account.

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all comments welcome.The more you scrutinize, the better my plan can adapt.Thank you.

\*Edit, Our reasoning for keeping the Tesla.

Yes the Tesla takes a big toll and does slow our progress down a lot.  
But we have talked it out and decided we wanted to keep the car.  
After calculating road tolls (1.500 p.m.), Gas (2.500 a month on my '06 1,3l disel Opel) and the current loan payments on that car (1.500 p.m). It's ""only"" 2.500 extra a month for the Tesla.  
That is not counting the maintenance on that car which has been a headache, And I am a certified Mechanic!

The Tesla is road-toll-exempt, I charge for free at work and at a supercharger station 20km away from my home.  
Full maintenance included for 5 years. So there are no extra costs outside the 8.000 a month.

That car has also given my self and my family more freedom and comfort. We now take longer day trips we never did before. My daily commute is both relaxing and enjoyable, I look forward to driving to and from work every day.

So long story short, yes this car is a financial burden, but it is a burden we are not willing to loose.  
If I loose my job or other financial burdens start to pile up then Yes I will sell the car.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrencies turn largely red as cryptocurrency mining chip manufacturer TSMC forecasts weaker demand in 4Q2018,"### Crypto News

* A report released by Moscow-based cybersecurity company, Group-IB,  finds that cryptocurrency exchanges have lost USD$882 million to hackers  over the last two years. The report goes on to forecast that the trend  will likely increase in the future as hackers more directly target  cryptocurrency exchanges. The most notable cryptocurrency exchange hack  occurred at the beginning of 2018 when Japanese crypto exchange,  Coincheck, was robbed of USD$532 million of NEM tokens. The report  highlights that some of the ‘busiest’ hacking groups involved in  orchestrating attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges include Lazarus,  Cobalt, Silence, and MoneyTaker. The report goes on to detail, “In 2019,  cryptocurrency exchanges will be a new target for the most aggressive  hacker groups usually attacking banks. The number of targeted attacks on  crypto exchanges will rise.” 
* A study conducted and published by Glassdoor, a career and  recruiting website, finds that cryptocurrency and blockchain related job  opportunities have significantly increased in 2018 despite a bearish  cryptocurrency market. Glassdoor conducted the study by analyzing a  large sample of online US job postings that contained keywords closely  related to blockchain, Bitcoin (BTC), and cryptocurrency. According to  the report by Glassdoor, as of August 2018, 1,775 job openings existed  in the US related to blockchain while, at the same time last year, that  number was 446 job openings -- this represents a whopping 300% increase  in blockchain and cryptocurrency related job postings.  
* After Bermuda’s House of Assembly enacted new crypto and blockchain  regulatory framework in July, the government has awarded the country’s  first certification for an initial coin offering (ICO). As per the Royal  Gazette, Wayne Gaines, Bermuda’s Minister of National Security,  announced while speaking at the Bermuda Executive Forum in Miami that  fintech company, Uulala, was awarded the certification. Uulala aims to  provide services and increase inclusion for underbanked people through  providing financial services and implementing a decentralized  peer-to-peer network that would “load cash into the digital economy”.  Funds deposited using Uulala also allow customers access to a virtual  MasterCard to participate in e-commerce and to send or receive  cross-border payments.  
* Cryptocurrency mining chip-maker, Taiwan Semiconductor  Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is forecasting weaker demand in 4Q2018 for  processors used by cryptocurrency mining hardware. While speaking in  their 3Q2018 earnings call, TSMC noted that their revenue will be  affected by “continued weakness” in the cryptocurrency mining market.  TSMC is the main supplier for Bitmain, the world’s largest manufacturer  of cryptocurrency mining hardware -- in Bitmain’s initial public  offering filing submitted in late September, investors learned that 60%  of Bitmain’s chip supply comes from TSMC. While speaking on the subject,  TSMC CEO and Vice Chairman, C.C. Wei said, “We estimate our 2018 growth  rate will be about 6.5% in US Dollar terms, which is close to the  foundry industry’s growth but slightly below our 7% to 9% guidance given  in the last conference.” 
* Gelfman Blueprint, Inc. and its CEO, Nicholas Gelfman, will more  than USD$2.5 million in fines after a New York federal court found the  firm guilty of operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme. Gelfman Blueprint  maintained 85 clients with 2,367 Bitcoin (BTC) under management as of  2015 after initially launching in 2014. In September 2017, the US  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed an anti-fraud  enforcement action against Gelfmann Blueprint after it told investors  that it had developed a computer algorithm called “Jigsaw”, which would  generate substantial returns through a commodity fund -- the entirety of  the scheme was a fraud. According to an announcement from the CFTC,  Gelman Blueprint and CEO Nicholas Gefman stole more than USD$600,000  from at least 80 customers. CEO Nicholas Gelman also constructed a fake  computer ‘hack’ to cover the firm’s trading losses.  
* Huobi, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Singapore, has launched a  new solution that allows users to switch between four different  fiat-pegged stablecoins in the event of price volatility or market  fluctuations. Huobi announced in a press release on Friday of HUSD, a  medium to facilitate exchanges of different stablecoins. When Huobi  users deposit, say, 10 Gemini Dollars (GUSD), they receive 10 HUSD in  exchange and their GUSD is essentially placed in a pool of other users’  GUSD. When users choose to withdraw, they are debited with the  stablecoin of their choice that is pulled from the pool of said  stablecoin. Robin Zhu, Huobi’s Chief Operating Office, points out that  the solution could potentially run into a problem if the pool is not  large enough to cover withdrawals.  
* Ripple Labs, Inc. and digital payments firm, Coil, have partnered  with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to implement Ripple’s  Interledger Protocol to support, “pro-poor payment systems”. According  to data from the World Bank, roughly 1.7 billion adults across the world  in 2017 were technically unbanked. Most unbanked individuals are low  and middle income earning individuals living in emerging markets without  access to clear identification information.  
* While speaking in an interview with Bloomberg, Galaxy Digital CEO,  Michael Novogratz, said that stablecoin Tether (USDT) should do a better  job of creating transparency in its operations. Novogratz said, “I  think Tether didn’t do a great job in terms of creating transparency,”  after which he noted, “The concept of stablecoins make sense.”  Novogratz’s comments come days after USDT lost its 1:1 peg to the US  Dollar and dipped below USD$0.90/token on many exchanges.

ethereum,Mastering Ethereum has completed copy-edits and is heading to the printers (and e-printers) by December,"Mastering Ethereum just completed the copy-edit process. It's in final production and heading to distribution by the end of November. Pre-order copies will start shipping from Amazon around the end of November, new orders by Dec 10th.

The book is twice as long as originally planned (400+ pages from 200). It has some gaps, due to the constant changing nature and sprawling breadth of Ethereum as a topic, but we'll have to address those in a second edition. Overall, I'm very happy with the result and I hope it serves to help thousands of developers get started and learn how to ""Master"" Ethereum.

personalfinance,"Help: I'm supposed to be making $120,000 per year at a new job. My first biweekly paycheck was $1,887.94. Is that right?","I live in California, which probably says a lot already, but I didn't know taxes would be this crazy.       
       
I'm stressing out right now because I'm taking home less than I was at my previous $80k job.      
      
I'll share this before I share the paycheck details.      
     
I did some calculations on additional withholdings before I started my job based on my partner's and my income. The calculator said $600 extra. That sounded high, but I added it to additional withholding. At my previous job I was withholding $200 extra.     
My first week at work I got a paycheck 517.57. For 1 week at my salary! I immediately stopped the additional withholding of $600.     
Is it possible that was still counted for the next two weeks?
Also, my insurance costs were billed double. Do you think they back-billed for starting new? And is the state tax right?     
I am taking out 401k too. I just don't understand how the taxes are so high.

stocks,The Buffet Indicator,"The Buffet Indicator is a method of determining if a market is undervalued or overvalued based on it's total market valuation divided by the markets GDP. Here is a link that goes into more detail: [https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php) . It's interesting to note that during the 2000 tech bubble crash, the market was at 142% of it's GDP meaning that the market was overvalued by 42% or by roughly $5 Trillion (Total GDP was only 10 Trillion). This was at the peak of the tech bubble before it popped and the market corrected. From 2003 - 2006 the market recovered and GDP and the market valuations were in sync.. then we began to inflate the market into 2008 and the market popped again. Since 2008, interest rates have been 0 and QE has inflated the market to historic highs.. the market is currently overvalued by 9 Trillion dollars and again is sitting at 142% of GDP. This is considered SIGNIFICANTLY OVERVALUED territory, and with the economic contraction that's taking place.. GDP will decline further making the market even more overvalued... IMHO, the market is propped up on hype and cheap money/leverage...the value of the market will have to correct to meet our GDP and I believe that correction is starting and will continue for the next 2 years.",finance

I'm refinancing my student loans as the current interest rate is criminal. Originally I had a parent co-sign the loan while in school.

I.E. if say an inquiry was put on my mother's credit, would her records essentially show just the co-signed loan and say that is paid in full/fulfilled",finance

personalfinance,Short amortization schedule,"I'm buying a home and worried about rising interest rates. I'm approved for a fixed closed 10yr mortgage at 3.89%, which seems to be about as good as it gets for that sort of term. Demand in the area is steady but not growing by leaps and bounds, so I don't expect a ton of growth in value, esp not over the short term. There is a chance I'll have to sell and move early (3 yrs).

Does it makes sense to go for a short amortization schedule (15 yrs)? My thinking is that limiting money spent on interest and going deep on equity would be a good hedge against the slow-growth and potential short-term ownership. 

I can afford the higher payments, I'm well-insured against short- and long-term disability, and my career is relatively stable. I guess my biggest concern is the opportunity cost. Should I go with a more conventional mortgage term and focus on investing instead?

Does anyone have a good spreadsheet for this sort of thing?",finance

personalfinance,"Paying off student loans- Does it make more sense to pay all equally, or pick one to attack first?","Let's say someone has 3 different loans, all at roughly equal amounts and similar but not the same interest rates:

* Loan 1- $5,000- 4.75% interest

* Loan 2- $5,000- 4.25% interest

* Loan 3- $5,000- 3.75% interest

Let's say the minimum monthly payment for everything combined is $100.

So you're going to pay $100 per month, but let's say you can afford to pay a total of $400 per month. What makes the most economic sense, after paying the minimum $100 balance?

* Option 1- Spend remaining $300 entirely on Loan 1 (with the highest interest rate)

* Option 2- Split the remaining $300 equally and pay off an additional $100 on each of the 3 loans

I'm guessing it makes sense to focus everything on the loan with the highest interest rate, correct? Assuming that is true, what if Loan 2 was, say $10,000 instead of $5,000. Does it still make sense to focus on Loan 1, or would Loan 2 take priority, and for how long?",finance
worldpolitics,"Inspire the VOTE! ""An American Catharsis"", We See You... Our Eyes Are Open.","An American Catharsis  


Having signed up for a new internet community service, ""Free Talk  24""(freetalk24.com, created by One America News Network), my adventure  into user posts began. Along the way I encountered threads discussing  the state of America. People from all over, posting memes, support for  President Trump, presentations summarizing the new administration’s  successes, and the unending evidence revealing the past administration’s  failures, corruption, lies…all evidence of the Democrats attempt to  destroy our country.  


As middle-aged American-born citizens, my wife and I watch, listen, and  read voraciously about what is happening in our country. Prior to the  2016 election, we found ourselves without much hope. We even discussed  where we might move outside our country if Hillary won the presidency  and the move to socialism completed. For many years we watched the  dismantling of America. When Trump won the election, a new hope stirred.  We were wide-eyed and optimistic. It seemed there might be hope after  all, and for the first time in decades, we felt guarded optimism. For so  long we felt imprisoned by our government, slowly shredding our  Constitutional freedoms and rights, more and more strangled by the  system. Such dark days passing, one by one, edict's flowing from the  highest seat in the land, subverting our founders’ design for our  Republic. As I write this reflection on how we felt prior to Trump's  victory, I'm realizing the depth of despair set upon us, terrifying (my  poor children), in some way this looming fear of our own Government must  be how the 2.5 million colonists must have felt before armed conflict  broke out.  


Here I sit, grasping onto faith instilled in my youth, once again we the  people, finally have a citizen statesman leading the Republic.  Inspiration is an odd feeling, having felt so helpless for so long, in  some way writing this, which started as a response to one of the  postings on freetalk24.com, has turned into a surge of catharsis. What  follows is where my response began, the opening may seem random, at the  time one of the posts spoke of an enemy, some undefinable entity that  has materialized, built and become more aggressive in my lifetime. Is  this what a REVELATION feels like? Writing this I realize why I've felt  so vulnerable and small for so long, this concealed entity has slowly  revealed a complete system, judicial, religious, political, social,  economic, executive (Obama) and as its final targeted takeover military  components. Thank God our military is the last bastion of Patriotism  that have battled and refused to surrender America.  


""They"" were and still are in many ways very close to establishing a  complete centralized state, in our case a deep state. This ""State""  within our nation is embedded within the ""Acronym Agencies"", i.e. EPA,  DHS, FCC, NOAA, DOE, HUD, DOC, DOHHS, DOT, ED, ATF, FAA, FDA, DOD, FBI,  CIA, DOJ, NSA, and so on.  Not accountable to nor elected by We the  People. With a Social Justice (socialism by any other name) agenda these  supposed Americans employ the power of the state against their  opponents (DOJ or IRS pursue you if you're not on their plantation), a  Fascist authoritarian suppression of an opponent. Recent leaders have  rented and sold American policy, intellectual property and state  secrets, a systematic war to dismantle our Republic, of course enriching  themselves in the process.  


As much as our own success and blessings have allowed American apathy to  flourish, we have been the victims of an assault, an organized media  propaganda campaign to nurture apathy and hopelessness in our citizens.   Our country is at war, a covert war waged within our own body politic,  the enemy is embedded at every level of our government, bureaucracy, and  main stream media. Their goal is clear: to destroy our Republic.  Globalization, destroy national sovereignty, create national debt and a  financial crisis, force open borders and mass immigration, permanently  destroy our culture, dismantle the American family, and those who don't  assimilate will be silenced.  


From out of nowhere our last best hope has been delivered, a citizen  statesman in our highest office. Trump is well aware of the corrupt  enemy that is embedded within our branches of government. He has a plan  to get control back, to punish those responsible and ultimately to  expose and win the covert war to usurp our constitution.  


Our President's authority is decentralized, designed by our framers to  act with neither efficiency nor dispatch. It is obvious the so-called  political parties are in conflict. The House of Representatives and the  Senate must be empowered to support our chosen President's righteous  task, to return our government to the people. Separate institutions  sharing power in this time of war must coalesce, put aside their  rivalries and cooperate to once again reestablish our federalist  Republic.  


In this time, our task to root out the corrupt elected and unelected  bureaucrats requires citizens to VOTE their values, not their party. Due  to the mass propaganda effort, some might have difficulty even defining  the values our founders embedded at the core of our country. Let us  reflect historically on some of our nation’s divinely inspired values  your VOTE supports.  


1.      We value that all men being born free are endowed with rights to  life and liberty; each individual's right to life is inviolable; each  individual's liberty is considered an unalterable aspect of the human  condition.  
 2.      We value our Creator who endowed us with inalienable rights,  truth is at the core each right, all men are equal under these righteous  truths.  
 3.      We value each citizen having the right to pursue happiness unhampered.  
 4.      We value the right to speak and express ourselves freely.  
 5.      We value the right to freely exercise religious diversity.  
 6.      We value and protect property rights where people can freely acquire, use, and dispose of personal property.  
 7.      We the people give government its powers for this strictly  limited purpose of securing citizens' rights, the government shall have  limited power which protect the rights of all citizens.  
 8.      We value individual Liberty, we are free to think, speak and act independently.  
 9.      We value the common good and community welfare.  
 10.   We value due process in the pursuit of justice, protected from denial or delay of justice.  
 11.   We value self-governance, of the people, by the people, for the people.  
 12.   We value Individual identity is held sacred and that dignity and integrity should not be violated  
 13.   We value that to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted  among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed,  that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends,  it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to  institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and  organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to  affect their Safety and Happiness.  
 14.   We value that all citizens have political and legal equality,  treated as equals before the law we are not to be denied these rights  unless by due process of law.  
 15.   We value the reasonable expectation of privacy.  
 16.   We value states having an equal voice in the senate and each  state's influence in selecting the President as protected by our  founder’s grand federal design that respects the sovereign role of  states via the Electoral College.  
 17.   We value strictly limited government, Federalism's separation of  powers between our three branches of government, the Legislative (House  of Representatives &amp; Senate), Executive and Judicial. We value  checks and balances between each branch to limit the powers of the  others.  
 18.   We value the right of the people to keep and bear arms, not to be  infringed. We value the right to keep and bear arms to defend against  mob rule, government tyranny and for the purpose of self-defense.  
 19.   We value true justice, a fair and equal system of rules and laws,  administered with fairness and equality for all…NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.  
 20.   We value our common defense by our government from another country or nation.  
 21.   We value domestic tranquility, living in a peaceful society where common people are protected.  


In many ways our liberties, freedoms and values have already fallen  victim in this covert war within America. Marxism has penetrated all  levels of government agencies, especially the central bureaucracy.  Whereas in the past the Federal Government was not involved in the  education system, it is now predominant. Our children have been under  attack, the education system has effectively been captured and is now  doing the bidding of the enemy, threatening the future of our nation.  Socialism, atheism, evolution, economic determinism, anti-traditional  framework of sex and family, moral relativism and communism are all a  part of the new American curriculum, taught every day in schools across  America. This tactic has impacted every grade level even higher  education. Destruction and corruption of the American education system  has come to pass.  


""Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for  socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get  control of the teachers' associations. Put the party line in text  books."" The naked communist, W. Cleon Skousen. Goal achieved! We now  teach our children nothing of our proud history, we teach them to either  parrot the “Party Line” or be ostracized. Is that what we want? I think  not.  


Our country is being, in Obama’s words, “fundamentally transformed.”  This is your wakeup call. You are at war, whether you want it or not,  you have no choice in this matter. America has been under attack for  multiple generations. Sun Tzu would be proud. Avoid strength and attack  weakness! America is likely the most transparent and open society on the  planet. America's immigration, education and political systems are all  identifiable weaknesses. Each of these systems has been infiltrated by  far-Left Communists/Socialists, to overtake and transform our country  from within. Elected officials are not required to have a background  check once elected, they only need be a citizen for nine years, meet an  age requirement and live in the state they wish to serve. Simple, yet  effective. Immigrate, run for office, serve in any capacity and continue  moving up, rinse and repeat with 100's of agents. Now you have multiple  levels of control within the American government. Influence and change  culture, policies and laws. Alternatively, the enemy can also purchase  corrupt traitors to do their bidding in the halls of power, with the  same outcome. Infiltrate the education system using similar methods,  accomplished much easier. Change literature, rewrite history, weaken the  curriculum, and campus culture by bullying and shaming anyone who  disagrees. Influence America's youth for generations, prepare the youth  for communist and socialist agendas. Use the youth to advocate for the  same agendas, use the youth to create mobs, riots, atrocities and other  public discord. This has already come to pass.  


American's must realize the current battlespace, it is far reaching,  well beyond this summary level text. Acknowledging we are active  participants in a covert war is a starting point. The next step is to  take active steps, launching a counter offensive where possible. This  operation has bad actors within our own government, our own education  system and in some cases our children have been turned against us. This  seriously limits viable alternatives to fight back. Right now, we have a  unique opportunity. Mid-term elections are right around the corner,  your VOTE is the first salvo as a warrior of freedom.  


1.5 million Americans have died wearing America's uniform since the  founding of our country. This is your chance to be a warrior for our  freedom, stomp on your complacency, shred your apathy, have faith in  yourself and your countrymen, we can and will be victorious. Our  American spirit may have been sleeping, but you can feel it waking. Let  it roar! In appreciation of our Liberty, the greatness of America we  must fight, each and every one of us. Fight for yourself, for your  children, for your countrymen, we must be victorious!  


Attention citizen soldiers! Your direct fire weapon is your VOTE. You  finally have an effective weapon in this prolonged battle. Vote your  values not your party, these fundamental values should be shared by  everyone in our nation. Values are not party centric, this nation was  organized based on our founders’ values, they are embedded in the fabric  of this country, in your community, in the Constitution, the Bill of  Rights and Declaration of Independence.  


To achieve victory, we have to enable our president to enact the  policies necessary to retake our country. We must not vote party lines.  Take the time to contemplate your principles, values, beliefs, ethics,  and moral virtues.   


Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not,  indeed MUST NOT, perish from the Earth. We must be engaged. Re-align the  three branches of government. Eliminate the resistance, deny the  obstructionist, cease the delays, stop the destruction of our country.  WAKE UP, DRAW YOUR VOTING WEAPON, fire the KILL vote (shot) that will  enable the retaking of our country. VOTE REPUBLICAN.

personalfinance,a Vulnerable Adult unable to pay off a large credit card balance,"Hello, I am currently serving a vulnerable adult who got into some credit card problem. This individual is hoping to get some help from this sub and I appreciate all your help in advance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, in the process of moving eight months ago, this individual opened a credit card at a local furniture store  to purchase a few pieces for the new apartment. I did not notice this until about 2 weeks ago, and the balance is now roughly $4500. Because of this individual's limited RSDI income, this person is only able to make $200 monthly payments.    This individual has agreed to cut the credit card such that no new transactions may be completed. The credit card account is still in good standing. I called to see if this individual qualifies for any assistance program, but the credit card representative stated that they would not know until the account is handed over to the collection agency.

&amp;#x200B;

If this individual continues to pay $200 per month, the balance would be paid off in about 3 years.  (Credit Card interest rate is roughly 28%, compounded annually)

This individual may elect to get a loan from the credit union, and the options are:

1. 3 year term. 8% interest. $141 per month
2. 4 year term. 8% interest. $109 per month

This individual's monthly budget is of the following:

Income:

RSDI: $922

SNAP: $62

Expenses:

Auto Payment: $199 (Unable to get rid of the car as this person just got a new loan for it - only made 1 payment so far)

personalfinance,thinking through 2 options presented by ally (money market and 12 mo CD),"Hi everyone.  I could use some experienced insight into 2 options I’m considering right now.

First is a money market account to seemingly replace my checking account.  I use credit cards for most of my purchases and really only use my checking account to pay off credit cards.  I generally only keep 1500-2500 in there.  The interest rate is .8% better.  Ally doesn’t seem to have a minimum balance requirement.  I’m mainly worried about functionality.  Would I have to get a new card/checks for the account or could I transfer?  Is direct deposit able to be done with MM accounts?  And are there any other considerations I’m neglecting?

The second option is a CD...I’m thinking 12mo. Ally savings is at 1.85% I think.  The 12 mo CD is 2.5%.  I currently carry a lot of money in savings.  I have a normal emergency fund meant to account for ~5 months expenses, some extra set aside as I could need to replace my car at any moment, and my extra savings is put aside as DP for a possible house purchase in the next 2-4 years.  I, thinking I could take the money set aside for the mortgage DP and invest into the CD without much risk of needing those funds.

personalfinance,House selling / purchasing scenario,"I have a scenario any input this sub can weigh in on it would be fantastic. 


I built a house 8 years ago and, in that time, the surrounding area real estate prices have exploded.  The road I live on has a preschool and has built another in that time and there are plans to build a high school.  Residential developers are building as much as they can in that area and we want to sell to capitalize on the market and possibly move to a more established area in a less expensive house.  As part of a 5 year financial plan in doing that we can pay off about $40,000 in student and car loan debts and put a good amount of money into the new house for a good net monthly cost savings. 


I currently owe about $162,000 on my house and for my next door neighbor recently sold his house which is nearly identical for $290,000 to give an idea.  I’ve posted my house on Zillow as a make me move for $340,000 to gauge interest which I don’t expect but I think we can sell in the low 300’s to 320 if I let it sit on the market a little while.


One of the properties I am looking at is listed for $185,000 and I’d guess needs about $30,000 worth of improvements.  Other houses vary from $220,000 to $300,000.  I think my preference is the save money on a less expensive place now for a few years then upgrade but I want to lay everything out.


2 questions:


1.  Do my calculations here seem accurate?

If I sell for $315,000 as a for sale by owner and pay a real estate lawyer to close (I’m guessing 5K, idk) that leaves $310,000.

After I pay off my current mortgage at $162,000 and other debts of $40,000 that leaves $108,000.  I will conservatively assume $100,000 towards another house after moving costs.  Those monthly payments are $1,424.46 mortgage, $416.46 for the student loans and $376.78 for the car.  $2,217.70 total.


According to the mortgage calculator:

A $200,000 mortgage on a new house with a 5% interest rate would be $820.15 a month netting a monthly net savings of $1,397.55

A $250,000 mortgage on a new house with a 5% interest rate would be $1,088.57 a month netting a monthly net savings of $1,129.13

A $300,000 mortgage on a new house with a 5% interest rate would be $1,356.98 a month netting a monthly net savings of $860.72


2.  What types of loans should I use?  I imagine I could put an offer in with a contingency that we sell our house but if not should I use a home equity loan or bridge loan?

personalfinance,How to ask for a raise/promotion in retail? Or should I just find a new job?,"I've been working in retail for the past 3 years and at my current store, a higher end women's retailer, for the past 8 months. I currently make $10 and hour, but I would like to increase it as I feel as though the time and energy that I have been putting into the store has exceeded my wage.

 We currently are in a hiring crunch and have been detrimentally short-staffed on both the management and associate ends, so I have been having to take on additional workloads and stress during the day because we are so short-staffed. This is something that I know will only increase as the holiday season quickly approaches. I also work every single closing shift for my store (I have closed 5/6 nights a week for the past two weeks and I will again for the next 2), which is arguably the worst shift and the hardest to find coverage for so I feel as though I am providing my store with much needed support. I also have requested off for a few days over the past month and have not received the time off I would like and have still come in for shifts on these days. I do good work, but it seems like all of the management is too busy to discuss promotion with me or are forgetting. I have asked what the process would be to step into a more senior role, nobody has seriously followed up with me. 

I would like to increase my pay to at the least $12 an hour and I would like to lay it out firmly with my manager tonight. How should I frame my request and let them know how I am feeling? It is the holiday season and I know other retailers are desperate so I am wondering if I should just look else. We are so short staffed that my store needs people and I was wondering if I should leverage a possible seasonal associate position elsewhere against my current position. Would that be too risky though? Thanks for all your help in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Credit Card Debt vs. Saving Money Dilemma!,"I’m new to this sub, but I’ve been reading everyone’s posts and threads on paying off credit card debt the last couple of months and it’s helped me out a lot! So I decided, why not ask for some help with my situation as well?

I’m 28 years old, make $65k a year ($3,800 take home monthly) and live with my girlfriend in Los Angeles, CA. My company matches my 401k contribution every paycheck at 4%. Credit score is currently at 640-650.  I’ve been helping my parents out financially the last couple of years because they are going through hardship financially, and unfortunately that has put me in debt as well. I’m approaching the next stage of my life with no savings and want to start saving as much as I can for engagement, wedding, house, and children. But that seems like a tough thing to do right now with the debt I listed below. What are everyone’s thoughts on how I should pay off my credit card debt the most efficient/quickest way as possible? My ultimate (and realistic) goal is to payoff all credit card debt by mid-2020, but any advice on how to do it even sooner would be great! 

**Debt Breakdown:**

1. Credit Card A: $12,400 @ 16.74%: minimum monthly payments are usually $230\~ (called for a lower interest rate but got denied). Currently throwing $700/month at this card.
2. Credit Card B: $4,600 @ 20.74%; but is currently at a promo rate of 0% until April 2019. Currently paying the monthly minimum of $25.
3. Credit Card C: $520 @ 20.99%; currently paying the minimum monthly of $25.
4. Credit Card D: $980 @ 0% until January 2020. Currently paying $65/month to avoid interest when the promo expires.
5. Auto Loan: $316.05/monthly with 3 years left. I heard Navy Federal CU doesn’t re-finance so might look to re-finance somewhere else.

I get December bonuses of $2k every year and tax refunds in the spring at about $1k (both of which will go toward Credit Card A). 

*Current total monthly payments: $1,066*

Below are the list of my other monthly expenses:

**Living Expenses:**

Rent: $795

Utilities (Gas, Electric, Internet): $50

Gym Membership: $33

Gas for Car: $200

Groceries: $100

Household/Toiletries: $50

Fun Money: $200 (this one is a tough one when being in a relationship. But fortunately my girlfriend understands as she has her student loans to pay off as well.)*Current living expenses total: $1,428*

**Savings:**

Emergency Fund: $200/month

Savings Account: $200/month

I’ve been flipping my old items on OfferUp and have done the Postmate/Uber thing (but don’t want to run my car to the ground) for extra moolah. Extra income ranges from an extra $200-500 month.

**So I have three major questions (and any other advice would be much appreciated as well!):**

1. Which credit card do I pay off first? Right now I’m putting all my extra money at Credit Card A. It’s the biggest balance and I’m tired of looking at the large number!
2. Should I start putting more than the monthly payment at Credit Card B since the 0% APR promo rate is ending in about 6 months?
3. Should I hold off on putting money into my savings account until I pay off my credit card debt or continue throwing $200/month at it? I want to get my emergency fund up so I'm throwing $200/month at that and will continue to. I recently had to get $2k worth of repairs to my car and charged it to Credit Card B ☹

personalfinance,Question about my auto loan,"Hey folks,

i have a question about my auto loan that someone can help explain to me.

I bought a car this year and my interest rate was 3.9 which meant that i was charged  70 dollars a month. I really have been trying to pay down debts so i decided to apply all my money to this car note. I now only have 3.5 left on the car and it will be paid off

According to like the principles of loan amortization, i will be paying the most amount of interest in the beginning but since i paid off 80 percent of the car will the interest charged every month still be around 70 because i have only had the car for around 5 months or will it drop to whatever the interest would have been if i held the loan for 4.5 years and had just a little to pay off.

EDIT: Sorry i worded it like a idiot.

is interest based off:

1. principal: as principal goes down so does your interest paid amount
2. coupon number: they are in chronological order meaning that if i bought a car and paid for 90 percent of it i would still be paying for the interest amount on the first coupon payment

I think the person above me answered my question! I think i was confused because bond amortization always taught us that interest is predetermined and that every month will already have a calculated interest amount so i thought it would go in sequential order",finance

personalfinance,270k from injury settlement. What to do? What not to do?,"So without going into details, I'm going to receive around $270k from a personal injury settlement (that's after the lawyers fees, insurance lien, etc.). The money from this settlement will not be taxed (though obviously any capital gains from investing it will be).

Here are some facts of my financial situation:

* $26k in private student loan debt at 6.4%
* $28k in 7 govt. student loans with rate ranging 3.83% to 4.66%
* $8k in Credit Card debt. Currently in 0% APR for all but one card (which is 18%)
* My parents had to take out a PLUS loan to pay for my education of about $20k. They aren't financially secure (my mom is a sub and my dad works for a catering company) and I consider this money that I owe, not them. I would like to pay it off. I made this decision myself, without their prompting. I see it as payback for helping me out without question whenever I needed it, even if they weren't in a position to give. They see it as their parental duty. I still want to make it up to them
* Besides this windfall, my income is \~$30k a year. I work retail and do freelance work on the side.
* I have no savings right now. Just $150 in a Schwab Brokerage savings account. I was unemployed most of last year (my income on my 1040 last year was less than $1000) hence the credit card debt and no cushion.

Here are some things I know I need:

* A rainy day fund. I've estimated that $12k could cover me comfortably for \~6 months. Should I take this money and park it in an account? Should I incrementally put it in 6 month CDs? What's the smartest way for me to save this money?
* A retirement fund. I'm planning on opening a Roth IRA. What should my starting amount be? While my current job has a 401(k) they don't match contributions and I'm not planning on staying there much longer (unrelated to my settlement. I just want and need a new job). Should I still contribute to it (I'm not currently)?
* To pay off my debt. If I payed off all my debt at once, I'd still have almost $200k. Should I just pay it off to be done with it? Should I pay it off incrementally? Should I just pay off the higher interest rate loans first? How can I determine the smartest payment plan for each loan
* To prepare for medical expenses. Due to this injury, I will need another surgery and extensive physical therapy within the next 5 years. I've been told in no uncertain terms that I will get arthritis before I'm 50. My surgeon estimated future medical costs of $126k. Obviously any insurance that I have will cover part/most of this, but I still need to prepare for that eventuality.
* A new car. My current car is almost 20 years old and is actually falling apart. I've been putting off repairs because they cost more than the car is worth. I simply have not been able to afford to buy a new car with my current income, partly because of my debts and partly because my high credit usage has tanked my credit score. Would it make more sense to try and get a 0% APR loan for a car or just pay for the whole thing out right?

For my goals, I'd like to turn this money into a somewhat steady source of income for me. I'm really hoping this settlement can help get me some financial security. My uncle (who teaches business and has made most of his money on the market) spoke very highly of ETFs. I also like the idea of putting some of my savings into a money market mutual fund. But the truth is I don't know much about finance, I don't know what all my options are, and I don't know what traps to look out for (beyond don't hide your cash under a mattress. Invest diversely. Don't spend beyond your means. etc.)

There are also a few smaller purchases I want to make and I'm planning on going to Europe with some friends in May, but those things total under $6k so I'm not sweating them too much.

If I do the extreme with everything above (pay off all debts outright, start an IRA with $5.5k, get a brand new car for $20k upfront after fees, put $12k into savings) I still have $140k to save for future medical costs and invest for future income. Being wise with all this is a little daunting, and I'm not sure what I should do, what I should do first, and I what I need to achieve my goals.

&gt; Federal student loans are the only consumer debt segment with continuous cumulative growth since the Great Recession. As the costs of tuition and borrowing continue to rise, the result is a widening default crisis that even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell labeled as a cause for concern. 

&gt; Student loans have seen almost 157 percent in cumulative growth over the last 11 years. By comparison, auto loan debt has grown 52 percent while mortgage and credit-card debt actually fell by about 1 percent, according to a Bloomberg Global Data analysis of federal and private loans. All told, there’s a whopping $1.5 trillion in student loans out there (through the second quarter of 2018), marking the second-largest consumer debt segment in the country after mortgages, according to the Federal Reserve. And the number keeps growing.
Student Debt Just Keeps Growing

&gt; Student loans are being issued at unprecedented rates as more American students pursue higher education. But the cost of tuition at both private and public institutions is touching all-time highs, while interest rates on student loans are also rising. Students are spending more time working instead of studying. (Some 85 percent of current students now work paid jobs while enrolled.) Experts and analysts worry that the next generation of graduates could default on their loans at even higher rates than in the immediate wake of the financial crisis. 

&gt; “Students aren’t only facing increasing costs of college tuition; they’re facing increasing costs of borrowing to afford that degree,” said John Hupalo, founder and chief executive officer of Invite Education, an education financial planner. “That double whammy doesn’t bode well for students paying off loans.” 

&gt; Student loan debt currently has the highest 90+ day delinquency rate of all household debt. More than 1 in 10 borrowers is at least 90 days delinquent, while mortgages and auto loans have a 1.1 percent and 4 percent delinquency rate, respectively, according to Bloomberg Global Data. While mortgages and auto loans have experienced an overall decrease in delinquencies since 2010, student loan delinquency rates remain within a percentage point of their all-time high in 2012.

&gt; Students attending for-profit universities and community colleges represented almost half of all borrowers leaving school and beginning to repay loans in 2011. They also accounted for 70 percent of all defaults. As a result, delinquencies skyrocketed in the 2011-12 academic year, reaching 11.73 percent.

&gt; “Delinquency is at crisis levels for borrowers, particularly for borrowers of color, borrowers who have gone to a for-profit and borrowers who didn’t ultimately obtain a degree,” she said, highlighting that each cohort is more likely to miss repayments on their loans than other public and private college students. 

&gt; Those most at risk of delinquency tend to be, counterintuitively, those who’ve incurred smaller amounts of debt, explained Kali McFadden, senior research analyst at LendingTree. Graduates who leave school with six-figure degrees that are valued in the marketplace—such as post-graduate law or medical degrees—usually see a good return on their investment.

&gt; The cost of borrowing has also risen over the last two years. Undergraduates saw interest on direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans jump to 5 percent this year—the highest rate since 2009—while students seeking graduate and professional degrees now face a 6.6 percent interest rate, according to the U.S. Department of Education.

TL;DR: Rising levels of tuition debt, rising interest rates on student loans, and those that go to for-profit colleges or fail to graduate are the most at risk for default.",finance

In a piece for FiveThirtyEight, Clare Malone and Jeff Asher pointed out that the first annual crime report released by the FBI under Trump was missing nearly three-quarters of the data tables from the previous year. “Among the data missing from the 2016 report is information on arrests, the circumstances of homicides (such as the relationships between victims and perpetrators), and the only national estimate of annual gang murders,” they wrote. Trump said he wanted to focus on violent crime, and yet was removing the most powerful tool for understanding it.

&gt; 
&gt; And as for the country’s first chief data scientist—well, the Trump administration did not show the slightest interest in him. “I basically knew that these guys weren’t going to listen to us,” said DJ, “so we created these exit memos. The memos showed that this stuff pays for itself a thousand times over.” He hoped the memos might give the incoming administration a sense of just how much was left to be discovered in the information the government had collected. There were questions crying out for answers: for instance, what was causing the boom in traffic fatalities? The Department of Transportation had giant pools of data waiting to be searched. One hundred Americans were dying every day in car crashes. The thirty-year trend of declining traffic deaths has reversed itself dramatically. “We don’t really know what’s going on,” said DJ. “Distracted driving? Heavier cars? Faster driving? More driving? Bike lanes?”
&gt; 

&gt; The knowledge to be discovered in government data might shift the odds in much of American life. You could study the vaccination data, for instance, and create heat maps for disease. “If you could randomly drop someone with measles somewhere in the United States, where would you have the biggest risk of an epidemic?” said DJ. “Where are epidemics waiting to happen? These questions, when you have access to data, you can do things. Everyone is focused on how data is a weapon. Actually, if we don’t have data, we’re screwed.”
&gt; 

&gt; His memos were never read, DJ suspects. At any rate, he’s never heard a peep about them. And he came to see there was nothing arbitrary or capricious about the Trump administration’s attitude toward public data. Under each act of data suppression usually lay a narrow commercial motive: a gun lobbyist, a coal company, a poultry company. “The NOAA webpage used to have a link to weather forecasts,” he said. “It was highly, highly popular. I saw it had been buried. And I asked: Now, why would they bury that?” Then he realized: the man Trump nominated to run NOAA thought that people who wanted a weather forecast should have to pay him for it. There was a rift in American life that was now coursing through American government. It wasn’t between Democrats and Republicans. It was between the people who were in it for the mission, and the people who were in it for the money.

business,About to be given a role in a business that's being held back by a union...,"I figure the title might be polarizing enough to grab attention because it sounds like I'm an anti-fairness money grubbing dickweed, but here's the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I interviewed for a job at a hotel restaurant; the guy in charge used the word 'amazing' in our interview with regard to my qualifications and general way of thinking about my work, and as well as offering me a position under terms that I requested he also laid out up front what his plans are to keep me moving forward.  By the sounds of it, he wants to make me a go-to guy for various areas because of my experience in all areas of hospitality, but he might also want to act more like a sort of business partner given the nature of our mutual ambitions and the overall big picture way he treats everything.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I find myself about to step into a hotel kitchen given the position of first cook right off the bat and told that I will be trained in all areas and that this job could be conductive of the long term goals I mentioned during the interview (of course, that could just an attempt to dangle a carrot and get me to stick around, but...)

I happen to also be dating someone who has family working within the restaurant, and this was by complete happenstance as the man who's hiring me doesn't know I know anyone and no names were brought up on either side.  It does, however, afford me a lot of inside information.  

Apparently there's an issue with scheduling that comes mostly from the fact that the place still exists under a union - It used to be a casino and it looks like the union for casino workers still holds sway despite the casino part being taken out.  What this means is that due to all the seniority rules and such, scheduling becomes a nightmare because various staff members can just refuse to work on particular days because they simply don't want to and can't be disciplined, fired or negotiated with around that issue.  This would explain why when I stopped into the restaurant simply to get a glass of water, I found myself waiting at the 'Wait to be seated' sign for 5 full minutes without even seeing a waitress despite two full tables.  I ended up just going up to the expo area and knocking on the door only to have the manager that interviewed me get the water.  I have also never seen more than one waitress on the floor any given time I've been there. So they're massively understaffed and whoever was there at the time clearly couldn't be bothered.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, all of this may not be an issue to me - I'm only accepting part time work as it gives me time to continue developing my business and work on other projects.  However, if I were to decide to get some skin in the game and put an effort into actually strengthening the business, thus potentially getting a place nearer to the top and genuinely aiding my goals, these union rules would be one of the biggest issues standing in the way.  As someone with aspirations of running a restaurant and experience in coordinating people in a hospitality setting, it's more my desire to see the place I work at be as good as it can be than the want to exercise my power and yield more earnings.  I care deeply about my profession and hate to see a nice place get ruined by lousy workers.

personalfinance,"Does the ""Snowball Method"" Really Make Sense in my Situation?","After about 10 years of carrying credit card debt around with me, I am finally credit-card debt free! Fortunately, I don't carry any other debt other than a car loan and my student loans. I make close to $70k per year, and I figure to earn even more within the next year or two.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, my student loan debt totals about $30k (5.85% interest rate) while my car loan sits at about $10k (2.45% interest rate). I recently consolidated all my student loans so I'm set to pay those off in 8 years, and I'm on track to pay off my car in about 3 years at the current pace, but I am really pushing my budget hard to pay off all my debt sooner than that if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Does it really make sense to throw additional money at the car loan (following the ""snowball method"") first even though the interest rate is so low? Or would it make more sense to attack the student loan first given the higher interest rate? I've had a lot of success with the snowball method before, but I'm seriously questioning its whether or not it's the right approach here, so any feedback would be appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,PF: Can you clarify loan interest rates and the avalanche method for me?,"I am looking to aggressively pay off my loans for the lowest price. I don’t think I’m at the point of debating nickels and pennies, but I don’t want to pay hundreds of dollars extra if I can avoid it. I don’t understand the fine details of how student loan interest is calculated. I looked everywhere online for the answer, but maybe Reddit can help me out.

I am wondering if the “most expensive” of my student loans have the highest value of balance x interest rate. As the minimum payments are made, along with extra pay the loan with the greatest value of interest should change. To look at this, I made up these three loans:

Loan A: $4,000 @ 5.0%
Loan B: $6,000 @ 4.2%
Loan C: $7,000 @ 6.5%

If I dropped a whopping $5,000 on loan C, the new balance would be $2,000, and times it’s interest rate of 6.5%, you get $130 worth of interest, which is now less than Loan A’s ($200) and Loan B’s ($252). Is this how interest works? If it does, it means that the loan I want to target will keep changing as I pay them down, because even though a loan might have the highest interest rate, another loan with a higher balance but lower interest rate could still be better to pay off first/faster. It would be nice to have a calculator or optimizing software instead of figuring it out manually.

If it doesn’t work this way, and the avalanche method is what saves the most money, why would the interest continue to stay the same for the highest interest rate loans even if I’m paying extra money on them and they have decreasing principals? 

To add to the confusion, my SO and I have been paying extra money on our loans, and my minimum payments haven’t changed, but the one’s in my SO’s account have decreased. They probably just have different terms.

This all comes down to the actual way that interest builds up with loans, which I guess I need some clarification on. I appreciate your response and I’m sorry if this is difficult to understand.

Some back story if you want it: We are moving up to becoming a two income household, so we are planning to get rid of student loans ASAP. We have between $55k-$60k total and at the rate we are going we may be done in 3 years or less.",finance

# **Dow snaps 3-week losing streak, Procter &amp; Gamble surges** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/wall-street-futures-point-to-a-slight-rebound-after-the-dow-sheds-300-points.html)*

* The Dow rises 0.4 percent this week, notching its first weekly gain in four.
* The 30-stock index's gains on Friday are led by Procter &amp; Gamble's biggest one-day surge in a decade.
* Stocks remain down sharply for the month, however, as worries about rates and the global economy persist.
* ""The market is not going to have an immediate recovery; it tends to bounce,"" says Quincy Krosby of Prudential Financial.

*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Friday on the back of strong earnings from Procter &amp; Gamble as Wall Street tried to regain its footing after a sharp sell-off in the prior session.
*****
&gt; The 30-stock index climbed 64.89 points to 25,444.34, led by a 8.8 percent surge in Procter &amp; Gamble shares, their biggest since Oct. 28, 2008. The Dow also posted its first weekly gain in four, climbing 0.4 percent in that time. Procter surged after reporting better-than-expected earnings. The company said it got a boost from strong beauty-product sales.
*****
&gt; Honeywell and Schlumberger also reported better-than-forecast profits. American Express, PayPal and Skechers all posted on Thursday earnings that topped analyst expectations. Their shares rose 3.8 percent, 9.4 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively.
*****
&gt; The corporate earnings season is off to a strong start. With more than 15 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported, 83 percent have topped analyst expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 closed just below the flatline at 2,767.78, however, as declines in health care and consumer discretionary offset a 2.3 percent gain in consumer staples. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 percent to 7,449.03 as Facebook, Amazon and Netflix all pulled back.
*****
&gt; ""The underpinnings of the economy are still in place and earnings are still good,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. ""The market is not going to have an immediate recovery; it tends to bounce.""
*****
&gt; These moves follow a sell-off on in the previous session as investors worried about rising rates, geopolitical tensions and a potential slowdown in the global economy.
*****
&gt; ""The rising rates, rising volatility and the moves in currencies were a wake-up call"" for investors, said Gibson Smith, founder of Smith Capital Investors. ""Earnings should be supportive of stocks,"" but the market is entering a period where it is ""realizing the economy is in stronger footing.""
*****
&gt; On Thursday, the Dow dropped more than 300 points, following a plunge in Chinese equities. History shows that, when stocks plunge in China, the U.S. market is rarely immune as large exporters suffer.
*****
&gt; Overnight, China said its economy grew by 6.5 percent in the third quarter, missing expectations. Chinese equities surged, however, as officials took steps to support the market, and that was helping sentiment in the U.S.
*****
&gt; Stocks are down sharply for the month.The Dow and S&amp;P 500 have fallen more than 3 percent each in October, while the Nasdaq is down more than 7 percent.
*****
&gt; ""This whole thing started a few weeks ago when [Federal Reserve] Chairman Jerome Powell said we're a long way from neutral,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. ""What we're seeing here is a good old fashion valuation repricing.""
*****
&gt; Schutte added these recent pullback is a buying opportunity for investors.

# Third-Quarter Earnings Preview: What to Watch

&gt; Third-quarter earnings season effectively kicks off today, and it should be another good one. S&amp;P 500 Index companies are expected to report their ninth consecutive increase in profits and third consecutive quarter with earnings growth of over 20%. We expect these strong earnings gains to be driven mostly by solid economic growth, particularly manufacturing, and tax cuts—though higher oil prices should give energy sector profits a nice boost. The interest rate environment has gotten better for financials recently, which also helps.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Another-Quarter-of-20-Earnings-Growth-Likely-on-Tap.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; We like looking at company pre-announcements ahead of reporting season to get a sense of where results may come in. At 2.1, the ratio of negative to positive pre-announcements for the third quarter is higher (or more negative) than the second quarter and last year’s third quarter, but lower than the long-term average of 2.8 (Thomson Reuters’ data since 1995). We interpret this as a positive indicator of upside to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates, but the potential upside is more modest than in recent quarters.

&gt; Similarly, earnings estimate revisions can tell us something about how results will come in. Third-quarter estimates have held steady since the quarter ended on September 30, but estimates were cut by 1.6% during the quarter. The good news is that the reduction in earnings is lower than the average reduction, suggesting that results will probably exceed estimates, as they typically do.

&gt; So what should investors be watching during earnings season? We highlight these three factors:

&gt; **Profit margin pressure**. In general, companies continue to do an excellent job controlling costs and keeping their profit margins high. But tariffs, (slowly) rising borrowing costs, and budding wage pressures have put the market on notice for potential narrowing of profit margins.

&gt; **Profit growth peak**. We will again hear about peak profit growth this quarter. A peak in earnings growth is very different from an earnings decline, something we see as a long way off. “Historically, about four years have passed, on average, between an S&amp;P 500 earnings growth peak and the next recession, during which stocks have produced solid gains,” notes our Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch.

&gt; **China-U.S. trade tensions**. China will be important to watch again this earnings season given tariffs, the ongoing trade dispute, and related slower growth in the Chinese economy, which has pressured its stock market. We also expect to hear a lot about how companies are preparing for additional potential tariffs on Chinese goods, and whether they are seeing business in China drop off.

# The Calendar Is a Bull’s Best Friend

&gt; “October: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.” — Mark Twain

&gt; After six straight months of equity gains for the S&amp;P 500 Index and one of the least volatile quarters ever, the historically volatile October is living up to its name. However, earnings continue to be very strong, and we see very little reason to expect a recession over the next 12–18 months. By no means are investors out of the woods yet, as we wouldn’t be surprised to see more weakness and volatility before the midterm elections. Remember, the S&amp;P 500 dropped for nine straight days ahead of the U.S. election in November 2016. Nevertheless, there may be a silver lining for the bulls.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the majority of stock gains in midterm years have come late in the year. “Midterm years have tended to be the most volatile out of the four-year presidential cycle, and wouldn’t you know it, nearly all the gains for the year tended to happen in the final few months,” explained LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Gains-During-a-MIdterm-Year-Tended-to-Happen-Late.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; On average, the S&amp;P 500 actually has been negative year to date ate in early October during a midterm year. Importantly, markets can be jittery ahead of major events like elections. Once the uncertainty is resolved in November, solid fundamentals and strong seasonals could take over for a nice year-end rally.

personalfinance,Banking... is interest a good reason to switch/keep banking?,"So I currently bank with Capital One (360 checking and Money Market, as well as Credit Card) and still have an checking, savings and credit card with my local credit union as well.    


I switched to them because I was not getting any interest rate with my local credit union.  Further, I qualify for USAA and have my auto insurance through them; however, with that said, their interest rate (much like my local credit union), sucks.    


With my Capital One Money Market I get 1.85% and currently have about 43k in the bank.  So roughly I am getting 50+ bucks a month back on interest.  A long time ago, those on this sub said interest doesn't matter and it's all about the perks of whatever bank.   


So my question.  Do I stick with Capital One?  I am thinking maybe I switch my direct deposit to my local credit union, and closing my 360 checking while leaving the Money Market and CC open (I would transfer money monthly into the Money Market from the Credit Union so it continues to grow).  Thoughts?  Suggestions?",finance
personalfinance,Help with Debt Triage and Savings,"I'm hoping to get some advice on my financial situation as I've been avoiding it for most of my adult life and don't really know where to begin. I'm 28, living in Canada, and decided a few months ago to take charge of my financial responsibilities. My current credit score is in the 670s. I created a budget and am getting better at sticking to it. I have no problems paying the bills on time (for the most part), but I do have some debt that I'm not sure how to best handle. I also recently left a LTR, and as a result my monthly expenses went up by about $1000. I'm really struggling but I think a good strategy would go a long way. I would be so grateful for any recommendations re: an order of operations here.

**Goals:**

* Pay down debt
* Rebuild credit
* Start saving

Here's a quick picture of the situation:

* **Student loans: $23,716.51**
   * Interest rate: 6.20 % Floating
   * Daily Interest Charge: $3.59
   * Current Monthly payment (through repayment assistance program): $83.68

This is the scariest one to me - at this point, about half of my monthly payment goes toward the principle with the other half going to interest. Feels a bit like drowning.

* **Credit Card A (credit limit $2500) - maxed out**
   * Interest rate - Cash advances: 22.99%
   * Interest rate - Purchases: 19.99%

I've had this card for about ten years - started with a limit of $1000 and for some reason (lost on me) **they just offered me an increase of $2000 (up from $2500 to $4500).** I accepted, thinking it would help my credit score to not be carrying a full balance. I generally make $300-500 payments on this each month but haven't been able to get the balance lower than $1000 in the past year, and it always seems to catch up with me.

* **Credit Card B (credit limit $2000) - maxed out**
   * Interest rate - Cash advances: 24.99%
   * Interest rate - Purchases: 19.99%

I think I've had this card for 7-8 years. Same situation as above for the most part. In both cases, I almost never take cash advances.

* **Savings: TFS with nothing in it,** and that's all she wrote. I don't have any benefits through work and don't even know how to approach setting up a more aggressive savings plan. As a Canadian though, I do pay into the Canadian Pension Plan. But I would like to have a better safety net.

**Income/Expenses Budget:**

* I have a steady, full-time job with opportunity for upward mobility. I also work on a contract basis for another job, which can bring in anywhere from $400-$900 per month - BUT it's hard to predict, and they are not great at issuing paycheques on time.
* My current budget (accounting for bills and essentials, including my contract work at a safe estimate of $400 per month) leaves me with about $800 at the end of the month. It's not much, but it will go up to about $1000 once I pay off some outstanding tuition next month. I constantly find myself thinking of ways to generate more income but I'm not really sure how to go about that without stretching myself too thin.

I think that's all I've got, but if I've left out any important details or if any other info would help, please let me know!",finance
personalfinance,"26 and deciding if Vanguard Roth IRA is right for me, plus a few more questions","Hi I’m 26 and have been trying to deep dive into financial advice for a few months trying to learn what I should do about my situation— I know what I’m doing currently isn’t maximizing my funds.

As of now, I have $12,300 in IEVAX that my grandparents started for me when I was a kid, $2,800 in a 457(b) account from an old job, and about $5000 total in my savings/checking account. 

I have recently been thinking of consolidating the 12300 &amp; 2800 and opening up a Roth IRA with Vanguard and splitting up my funds three-ways between:

\-a U.S. total stock market index fund

\-an international total stock market index fund

\-a U.S. total bond market index fund

But, since I have &gt;$10,000, buying the Admiral Shares of the Vanguard Fund Index (VFIAX) sounds enticing. Can I do that within a Roth IRA through Vanguard? Also, is there an easy way I could dollar cost average my investment in pieces over time without incurring any trading commissions along the way? (Or I could spilt the money between the Vanguard Roth-IRA and buy VOO in Robinhood monthly overtime to get the same benefits of VFIAX without the $10,000 minimum, but honestly that sounds more of a pain)

Other possibly important tidbits:

\-I’m not sure if I’ll get a TSP in the future with possible contribution matching from an employee sponsored deferred compensation plan…as I might work for a federal job in a few years; would opening a Roth IRA from Vanguard still make since if this was the case?

\-I’d like to buy a house in \~10 years

**Basically I’m looking for advice on any redflags more experienced people may have before I pull money out of the accounts and start moving it around (timing, tax problems I’m not aware of, consequences with prematurely pulling out retirement money etc.) and if my plan sounds reasonable?**",finance
personalfinance,"Should I pay more towards principal on home loan, or invest?","I have an ""extra"" $200 per month - should I put that towards the principal on my home loan (5% interest rate on 30 year note), or should I add to my investments in my vanguard fund? 

It's shocking how little of my monthly mortgage payment goes towards interest, so seeing that go down an extra $2400 per year seems ideal, but not sure how the math works on this. 

Yes, I know I should try to refinance the loan to 15 year. Although I have excellent credit,  I still owe over 90%, so that's not an option right now.",finance
personalfinance,Have no knowledge in investing. Should I max out retirement accounts or save for a house?,"Hi Personal Finance, 

I have been lurking in the sub for a long time. This is my first ever post on reddit, asking for your advice. My question is in the title: Should I max out on my retirement accounts, or save money for a house. 

Where I stand: I will turn 30 in a few years, and I have a decent job with good career growth. My take-home monthly after all yearly and monthly expenses is \~$2,870 (thank you to /u/Clesmeh for your budgeting spreadsheet). My current expense calculation does not include insurance. I purchased a house last year, and have a 30 years mortgage of $440,000, interest rate of 4.25%. I paid off my car (which I bought 2 years ago), so I do not see myself getting another car for the next 10 years or so. I have no other loans beside my mortgage. 

I have two 401k accounts; one with my old employer which has  around $5,000, and one with my current employer. I actively contribute 6% of my income to my new 401K, and leave my old 401K practically untouched. I do not have any other retirement or saving accounts. So for now, all of my take home money goes directly and sits idle in my checking account.

The reason why I want to consider getting another house is that I am currently renting out rooms in my house, which is also my primary residence. If I can get another place, then this current unit will be completely rented out. 

I started and finished college late, so I want to catch up with my peers but I have no knowledge in investing money. I can only think of buying real estate, or relying on retirement accounts.  Any input from you wonderful people is greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

A clueless 26 years old.",finance

investing,Howard Marks - The Seven Worst Words in the World,"For those of you who haven't read Howard's latest memo, here's the link. https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos
  
I wanted to ask a question or possibly spark a discussion pertaining to market crashes. I would also like to state that I am NOT trying to prophecize a greater depression esque market crash. I am asking an open ended question as a discussion point.
  
I've been watching lately a lot of interviews with Howard Marks and he has been very careful in his response when asked about the potential for a crash. He feels that we are very late in the cycle, however the cycle may continue for far longer. He feels that there is a lot of greed and therefor, as Warrent Buffet says, we should conduct ourselves with more caution. People are becoming a lot more risk tolerant rather than risk averse. Again however he makes no allusions as to when or what may cause a crash, or that we may even have no crash at all and just a healthy correction. 
  
He sometimes compares today's market with things he was seeing in 2006 and 2007, thus his advice for moving forward but with caution. The notable thing however, and the basis for my question, is that he specifically says he doesn't see the same type of risk in the sense of unsustainable house prices coupled with essentially fraudulently rated triple A CDO's and the like which effectively created a multilayered meltdown where everything was interwoven and linked on a global scale. 
  
Barring hindsight, didn't ""no one"" see any of these things coming? Looking back now one might say that the aftermath that unfolded after Lehman Brother's collapse was ""obvious"", but prior to that the market definitely wasn't expecting it. If one subscribes to the efficient market hypothesis than all of that risk would have been effectively priced in had it been known. 
  
In the memo I linked and most of his interviews he talks more specifically of the risks he sees, the things that are known by the market and therefor, in theory, priced in. Risk tolerance by most investors, Fed rising rates to ""neutral"" and possibly beyond, large amounts of corporate debt, and finally the trade war with China. Again, these are the things that on the surface are ""obvious"" and pose certain threats to the economy. In theory all of this has been priced into the market. But, just as in 2008, what about the things that we don't, or can't, see? Everyone knew that housing prices growing at the rate they were in the 2000's was unsustainable, but what about that whole mess with CDO's? In theory, is it possible, that there are currently some very unhealthy going on's that are ""unseen"" by the market and therefor effectively not priced in. If something was to occur, say interest rates reaching a tipping point or further escalations in the trade war, it could act as a sort of trigger and much like in 2008 cause a cascading shit storm.
  
Ultimately what I mean to say is that, just as no one can know when or what will cause a market crash (or correction), one cannot effectively downplay it's severity by claiming this time is different because there isn't multilayered levels of fraud because these things are effectively unknowable - just as they were back before the previous crash occurred.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Thoughts on Guardium?,"I was beginning to have reservations about the app but then after watching Mark Jefferey's talk on tokenomics (https://youtu.be/TpUI2oMxDc0) I think I'm willing to invest a whole lot more.  
  
  I think that if the Guard team are able to create a fiat-&gt;GUARD-&gt;fiat gateway in the app... and of course if there's wide adoption of the app... the token could easily be valued at $10.  
  
  I'm basing that one a few things:  
  
  1. I work in the federal emergency services field. I dont think (and in talking to others) I would respond to any kind of call for less than $100.  
  
  2. A SPOT device subscription costs $150-$180/year. A home alarm system costs $180-$720/year. Medical alert devices cost $360-$1080/year.  
  
  3. GUARD requires a minimum stake of 10 tokens for the service. With an additional 1 token per device (Google home, alexa, etc.).
  
  
  
  Am I missing something here? Obviously widespread adoption of the app would be necessary. Along with the fiat gateway.

personalfinance,What is projected loan and how does it work when applying for an income based driven repayment plan?,"I was applying for an income driven payment plan and with my gross AGI I was able to apply fpr it. It said this:

"" Under the income-driven repayment plans, you may have the remaining balance of your loan forgiven if your loan is not repaid in full after 240 months (20 years) or 300 months (25 years). Whether your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years depends on the plan you choose, and if other conditions are met (see Eligibility Requirements in the Terms &amp; Conditions). Your Projected Loan Forgiveness will be $0 if we estimate that you will repay your loan balance in full within 240 or 300 months.

Projected Loan Forgiveness for PSLF 
Under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, you may qualify for forgiveness of the remaining balance due on your William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program loans after you have made 120 qualifying payments on those loans while employed full-time by certain public service employers. You must have made 120 separate monthly payments after Oct. 1, 2007, on the Direct Loans for which you are requesting forgiveness. In general to have a loan balance after 10 years, the 120 required payments should be while making reduced monthly payments under an Income-Driven Repayment plan. However, PSLF qualifying payments can also be made on a 10-year Standard Repayment Plan or any other Direct Loan Program repayment plan where the monthly payment is at least equal to the monthly payment amount that would have been required under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan.""

personalfinance,How to negotiate non-compete clause?,"Hi PF! I currently work as an attorney for a federal agency doing regulatory work. I am interested in getting out of litigation work after 10+ years in this job, and one avenue I am exploring is consulting for companies to stay in compliance before they run into problems (""ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure""). I recently interviewed for a consulting gig with a very small company which would be remote, based out of a different state, and I would be an independent contractor for the company. I liked the owner, company, vibe, and pay (would be about a 20-30% pay increase for 20% fewer hours total), but one thing that gave me pause is that they have a 1 year non-compete clause for new employees or contractors. Both I and the company are based in states with reasonably strong laws limiting the scope/nature of anti-compete agreements, but that is not my area of law, so I am not sure whether such a clause would be enforceable or not in my case.   

I would rather not deal with fighting a non-compete clause down the line if this consulting gig does not work out and I want to work in the same industry for a different firm. I am not sure if the non-compete clause is even enforceable, and I doubt this tiny company has really looked into or even knows about the possible issues surrounding non-compete clauses. When I emailed the owner asking to have this line removed from the contract and explained my reasoning, I got a somewhat lukewarm response and he said they would have to look into it. I was wondering what additional steps I should be taking at this point. Should I play hardball and decline the offer if he doesn't budge? Or should I just go with the clause if I have to and assume he won't want to or won't be able to enforce it in the future? I also need to keep in mind that the harder I negotiate on this clause, the less I will likely be able to negotiate on other contract items (mainly salary) and since I am dealing directly with the owner, it could set our relationship on the wrong foot.",finance

* open a savings account with a local credit union for better interest rates. move roughly 6K into it immediately. set up direct deposit for at least 25% of income. I would like 10K for a emergency fund and then to further start saving for a car on top of it.

Lately, I have been thinking of what would be the best way to handle my debt situation is not that is uncontrable but that I have to many obligations at different interest rates and I just want to organize things in one single payment. 

My current loan obligations are as follows:

Student Loans $8,920 at 3.8% currently pay $100 on this and still have a 5 1/2 year term for this loan.


Credit card with $4,860.35 pay $74 a month and no interest payments till next decemeber do to promotional offer.

Personal Loan A (Land purchase for mom's future house in native country) $10,300 at 12.99% currenly have 45 months left on this loan 


Personal Loan B (Car repairs and other expenses) $6,235 at 17.99% remaining term on loan 57 months. 


My income is 70K and save abou 40% of my income from paychecks each month. 


The idea would be to get a $30,000 loan hopefully at 10-12% repay all outstanding loans. Use my tax return from this year plus my work bonus and a portion of income from selling my car and move to leasing a car which would help me tacklet at least 40% of the loan balance. Hence I would only have about 18K left on the loan and I should be able to repay it within a 3 year time frame with addtional payments. Is this a good strategy?",finance

I'm trying to get my life together, I am employed making around 36k a year pretaxes.  I am putting 12% into my 401k that my company matches 6.5%.  There's been a few rough years for me and I used my credit cards to live on pretty much.  I am now using them only in emergency situations and trying to pay them off in order of higher interest rates.  I also have a student loan that I knocked down before I while I was able to.  In total I have about 30k in debt, 4k of that is my student loan. I have roughly 4k in my bank right now and I haven't checked my 401k in a bit because of an internet issue that should be resolved soon but it should be over 20k.

I know I should keep saving for emergency so my previous situation doesn't happen again and I shouldn't dip into my 401k to get rid of my debt.  My current job provides me a house so all I need to pay for are groceries and tv.

What I have been thinking about is debt consolidation in some way.  If I'm able to get all of the payments into a single payment I feel like I would be able to pay it off way sooner than I am now.

personalfinance,How do I get my financial life on track?,"I come to r/personalfinace hat in hand, asking for any suggestions/advice you all are willing to give.

I'm 30 years old and recently landed my first attorney job, after years of law school and a few years attempting to pass the Bar Exam. It's modest for California ($90K per year salary), but far better than any job I've held before. However, I'm in a complete hole financially and my credit is shit. I need to change this.

I've taken on about 150K in student loan debt if I combine undergrad and law school. Most of the debt is federal loans, about 25K is Sallie Mae personal loan used towards tuition costs. During law school, I deferred my undergrad payments. During my few years attempting to pass the Bar Exam, I paid a little towards loans, but also went into forbearance (I could not work while studying). The federal loans are on an Income-Based Repayment Plan. I also have about 12K in credit card debt (Wells Fargo + Best Buy + Target). Most of these cards I've had forever and just never focused on paying them off (maxed them out, made minimum payments). What really tanked my credit is that between ages 18 and 25, I was terribly irresponsible and missed payments. My credit score is around 600. 

I live in a one-bedroom apartment with my girlfriend. We split a $2100 per month rent (it's sadly the cheapest we could find for our city). I also have a car payment of $190 per month (lease, not own - could only get this deal because my mom is a cosigner). Overall though, with this new job, my monthly income is now a few thousand higher than my monthly expenses. I've been paying minimum on my student loans and credit cards up until now. I want to change that and work towards paying the debt/loans down. But I also know I need to save. I'm 30 years old and have NOTHING saved.

It's all so overwhelming though. I feel like I need to speak to a financial adviser to help me get my shit together. Should I consolidate debt? Should I work towards affording a house and maybe refinance my loans into the mortgage? (A fellow lawyer I know did that.) I've also seen commercials for SoFi, but I doubt I qualify for their refinancing programs...

Please help. Any advice is welcome. Just typing this up gave me so much anxiety. But I need to get my shit together if I'm ever going to want to start my future with my girlfriend.",finance

Looking for some guidance.","For the first time in my life I had to (acquire and) pay credit card a fees/interest on my credit card debt. I paid $10.56 on a remaining balance on one of my BofA cards, and I feel dirty, and quite concerned.


I have never had debt. I'm mid-thirties, few years into my career, zero student loans (studied abroad), married, one toddler. Wife is unemployed, kid goes to daycare (so wife can go out to work on an unpaid internship at a potential employer). Finances have been getting tight lately, and my overall credit usage is rising to the point where I can only pay off minimum amounts due. Most cards are on a trial (zero APR) period for a few more months, however two cards have significant APR (15-25%). After this first $10 of fees, I foresee a lot more in the coming months till either a) she gets a job and helps pay this debt down, or b) My income increases (which there is a slight possibility of).


Breakdown for my finances:

- After-tax income: $3500 /mo

- Rent + Utilities (gas, water, electric): $1300-1500 /mo

- Two phone lines + lease: $140 /mo

- Internet: $60 /mo

- Car lease + insurance: $380 /mo

- Groceries + Occasional eat-out: $300-400 /mo

- Daycare: $850 /mo

- Misc (Netflix, Equifax reports, occasional charity, more recently low-balance penalties in checking accounts etc): $50 /mo

- Gas: $60 /mo

- Recently, lots of travel (car, air, greyhound, train, hotel, airbnb) for job related purposes which has pushed the little savings we were scraping up into the -ve balance. Not a recurring balance, but lump sum ran in the $3-5000 range over few months.

- Above travel has put my car mileage way out-of-control, and I'm currently ~7000 miles over. Lease ends in 14 months, so hoping to deal with this looming disaster in due time.

- Currently have zero emergency funds, and only fall back is one credit card w/ a large balance and equally large interest rate.


I guess I'm looking for guidance and advice, (maybe few anecdotal words of encouragement?), about what changes to make / how to plan for the future so I don't fall into this terrible cycle of interest and minimum payments.


Solutions in sight for me at the moment:


1) Planning to stop donations to retirement fund, and also requesting a withdrawal of 401k funds (employer was making 100% matched contributions, so even if I pay fees etc I get a decent amount back)

2) Wife finds a job and helps out

3) Wife doesn't find a job, daycare stops, I save up and pay down debt

4) I get a promotion (which bumps my pay to ~$3800 /mo)

financialindependence,Fears before becoming more FI-based,"Hi everyone,

New(ish) lurker but first time posting here. My husband and I are lucky enough that, with our combined salaries, we do well enough financially and purchased a small home last year at a good interest rate. However, we aren’t currently saving very much, although we do have a decent amount in our savings account that we don’t touch. Still, this makes me uncomfortable and I’d really like to adjust our lifestyle so that we can move closer to FI or even RE. We love to travel and I would love a life where we could do that instead of working constantly. 

However - do any of you ever feel like it’s not worth it? Of course it’s necessary to be financially reasonable, but putting yourself out so much now with eyes to the future feels risky because you are assuming that future exists. I work with (often terminal) cancer patients, many quite young, and I think, If this happened to me, would I regret not having enjoyed myself more? I also have had the same thing happen to a few family members - they saved and saved for their 50s/60s only to die as soon as they got there. 

Maybe I’m just scared to make a lifestyle change, I don’t know. Just interested to see how other people view it.

investing,Why does everyone say that you can make more money with the cash option over the annuity when winning the lottery?,"I've seen arguments that state allowing the government to invest the money for you for 30 years will return a smaller percentage than if you did it yourself but the counter-argument I've seen is that if you let the government do it the starting capital is larger because it isn't pre-taxed before investment, something that would happen if you did it yourself. Which is the correct answer? Also, if you want to take it to the next level, with the annuity, you get money every year, which you can also invest back into something which would increase your net worth at the end of 30 years.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on next financial steps,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Writing this from a throwaway in order to be as truthful as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

We are a married couple (\~30yo) with a young child in the US East Coast.

We make about $200k annual (this is including bonus from work, etc).

Our holdings:

1. $23k in checking account.
2. $700 in savings account. I'm considering transferring \~$10k to it from checking for an emergency fund.
3. $90k in IRAs.
4. $40k in 401k. We only have the one and we max it out.
5. \~$120k in cryptocurrency holdings (sorry I meant $125k, uh no, $112k, ugh, nvm).
6. We own a single car worth about $12k, still paying about $4k of loan (with \~3.5% interest).
7. Are paying a refinanced student debt of around $40k (with \~2.5% interest).
8. We own a home worth about $310k, mortgage left is around $240k.

Recently we have allowed quite a bit of unnecessary lifestyle creep, and I am now starting to think it is because of how high we allow our checking account to go. The reason this has been happening is because I am not sure where to put the money that we have beyond the 401k. Previously I had tried to max out the IRAs as well but once our salaries increased I was made to understand that due to the higher salary we are no longer eligible to contribute to the IRA.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess what I am asking is for advice on how to best utilize our money once the 401k is maxed? I have had several ideas:

1. Since we would like to move in the near future, put the money into the principal of the current mortgage. That way it can be used for a downpayment on the next house. We are targeting a $450k - $500k house.
2. Put the money into an IRA in ETFs and pay whatever taxes are necessary? Traditional investments-wise we are pretty much fully invested in a single index fund ETF (VTI) so my thinking was to just put whatever extra money into the same ETF but within a non-tax deferred IRA. I am just not sure what are the mechanics of doing this and if it's even possible? Also hoping to get advice on how to do this correctly so I don't shoot myself in the foot.
3. Municipal bonds? CDs?
4. Cover our current debts? I did not consider this very seriously because our interest rates are not very high (\~2.5% and \~3.5% respectively for car and student loan) and I figured stock market returns would be better.

personalfinance,To downsize or not to downsize?,"I've been reading for a while, but this is my first personalfinance post on Reddit. Hi, everybody!

I'm struggling with a decision and hoped that the kind internet strangers of personalfinance would chime in.

Should I keep my house, or downsize?

Background: I am late 40s, single mom, divorced six years (single), teacher. I live in one of the hottest real estate markets in the country (Seattle). When I got divorced I'd been out of the job market for a few years as a stay at home mom, but I landed back on my feet and I have stable employment as a public school teacher, and I was able to refinance the house on my own.

The house is an older home with some updates and some delayed maintenance (due to my inability to pay for said maintenance!), such as exterior paint, yard work. I have to replace the sewer line (a clay pipe with root issues) and now this is an urgent repair, which is really making me think about my ability to keep the house.

Pros of the house: has nearly doubled in value since I refi'd it six years ago; now I have great equity. In a good neighborhood (walking distance to parks, ocean, and a shopping district, on a quiet street of single family homes, sidewalks, trees). It has 3 bedrooms plus office, 1.75 bathrooms, and a big attic that could one day be renovated to be a spectacular space with wonderful views of ocean and mountains.

Cons of the house: delayed maintenance (I'm starting to REALLY worry about roof and furnace, exterior and interior paint; the sewer line ""announced"" to me that it needs replacing NOW and so I'm dealing with that) and in need of updates (it's most definitely not high fashion, and the kitchen has laminate countertops on original cupboards). Higher taxes (growing annually), and because it's a larger home, higher utilities bills. I certainly do not need a house this big - while it's nice that my daughter and her friends can take over the downstairs basement for sleepovers etc., two people do not need 2400 sq. feet. I could easily be happy with two bedrooms, not three or four.

I am trying to make a non-emotional decision about keeping or selling, but the money isn't as clear as I thought it would be. My mortgage has $258,000 remaining on it with a 3.7% interest rate, with monthly payments just under $2000 including taxes and insurance etc. If I sold, after making realtor recommended repairs and upgrades to maximize the sale, and after paying realtor fees and taxes, I think I'd net about $350k that I could use to buy another, smaller home (townhouse or small house). 

HOWEVER....interest rates have climbed at least a point, so I'd be paying a higher rate on a newer mortgage. Also, I thought that my mortgage would be paid off at the same time I retired, and if I restarted then it would bump payment out six years (although of course I could pay more towards principle). Also, because the house is in a highly desirable neighborhood (modest, not fancy at all, but a great place to raise a family) it is expected to appreciate at a higher rate than other areas nearby. The house is far and away my biggest investment, and while I expect the Seattle bubble to pop again, I think in the long run this house will do well. I don't think I could afford any other homes within a one mile radius, so I'd move to an area nearby with less expected appreciation.

I'm living paycheck to paycheck (still saving for retirement, money I can't/won't touch) because of home repairs (e.g. now I'm paying $10,000 for a sewer repair, buh-bye savings and buh-bye vacation), and SICK of it. I thought if I sold, I could reduce my mortgage dramatically to stop that paycheck-to-paycheck feeling, but I don't think I can find a small (2 bedroom one bath) house nearby (keeping my daughter in same school) for less than $550,000, and I'm worried that in a new smaller house I'll still be dealing with sewer lines, and roofs, and electrical, and all the things that can go wrong in a house, so then I'll be paying for those repairs as I am now, but I won't be gaining as much equity, so the $500 or so that I'd save on a mortgage payment wouldn't be worth it.

Or would it?

personalfinance,Went from homeless teen to married and making money in 10 years. How can my spouse and I end up wealthy long term?,"Hello everyone,

I recently discovered reddit and r/personalfinace and wanted to ask for some help as to what I can do to ensure long term wealth for me and my spouse. I'm (25) looking for some advice as to what I should do with the money my spouse (30) and I are earning. 

My  income is: 

* $3750.00 every 2 weeks from work
* $1719.25 from the VA (nontaxable income) monthly
* $2367.00 from my Basic Housing Allowance (BAH) monthly (while I'm in school) from my GI Bill (also nontaxable)
* $30,000 in ally bank
* $20k in TSP (all C fund)
* $5k in Vanguard VTSMX
* $7k in old employer 401k (It's marked as a Fidelity profit sharing 401k and I have no idea what that means)
* $2k liquid
* $3k in CD (CD rate is 3% with Navy Federal) 
* My new employer throws 6% of my base pay into a 401k for me (also profit sharing 401k)

My spouse is in the military still and they get: 

* $700 every 2 weeks / investing $1500 into their TSP monthly \[ currently has about $20k in their TSP\]
* About $2,200  BAH monthly
* $369.39 monthly for BAS
* $10k into ally bank 
* $11k liquid 
* 3k CD (3% rate)

Bills: 

* $1.3k mortgage payment (monthly) 
* $160 phone bill (monthly)
* $50 internet bill (monthly)
* $ 100 electric (monthly) 
* $100 water (once every 3 months)
* $600 insurance (every 6 months)

We have a (30 year) mortgage of 220k (4% interest rate) as our only debt. Neither of us have student loan debt or car debt (we both bought used cars when we got back from our separate deployments) and both have our health care paid for by the military (TriCare) until 2022 (My spouses gets out of the military by then). We have no children. I grew up very poor (homeless) and my spouse isn't too knowledgeable with money so we're both trying to figure out what we need to do to become financially independent/ wealthy. Thankfully we're both thrifty \*coughcheapcough\* and don't drink, smoke, or have expensive tastes. I was wondering if we should pay the mortgage twice a month to pay that off faster or use the money else where to invest? We currently just pay it once a month. Also, I'm trying to read the *Intelligent Investor* by Benjamin Graham (It's a difficult read) to learn more about investing but I'm very lost overall. I made sure my spouse contributes as much into their TSP as possible and I'm going to be doing the same with my 401k. My spouse is very cool with letting me handle all of the finances because it stresses them out and I have no problem doing that I just want to make sure I'm making the right choices.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR;  What should my spouse and I do with our money to make sure we're wealthy.

  
Any and all advice is welcome. I appreciate your time! Thank you for any input. This is my first post so hopefully I did this correctly and didn't just ramble on my keyboard.

bonds,brain pain about bonds,"Straighten out my thinking.
I am a 70 yr old retiree, have no concerns about amassing or leaving a valued estate, just want to live as well as I can, and die broke.
About 3 1/2 yrs ago, I came into an inheritance, went to a bank financial advisor, 
and put majority of it into a managed portfolio &gt; 60% in a fixed income fund (for income and safety) 40% equity funds for growth and inflation hedge. 
Pretty straightforward textbook stuff, where I don't have to be active or smart.
And it's been OK, I take a fixed sum out every month for me.

Now I am looking at my situation of being 60% in bonds at a time when interest rates are expected to rise.
Not good; rising rates &gt;&gt; decreased bond prices. My future value looks bleak as (60% of) my capital erodes. 
Sorta like the miracle of compound interest in reverse.
Just to be clear, I'm comfortable with the 40% in equities, it suits my positive outlook. 
My issue is with the 60% in fixed income; thinking it would be better in cash, 
which may seem dead (limited to term deposit minimal rates), but is not subject to loss. 

Think about it for a day or two, and slap myself upside the head:
""self, you dummy, the future value of my bonds is *NOT* a function of market volatility in the secondary bond market, 
but *IS* predetermined by the maturity value of the bonds"" SLAP ""capice?"" 
self: ""duh, yeah, OK, sorry for being so stupid"".

Another day, another thought: ""Well, it would be ok if I directly owned bonds and reinvested them at maturity, getting cheaper bonds (higher yields); 
but really I own shares in the fund, and the future value of those shares is not fixed by maturity value, 
and *IS* subject to market volatility, and is likely to decrease with rising interest rates.""

personalfinance,What happens when an Online Banking service Fails? (That supplies FDIC through a partner bank),"What is the recourse if the non-banking member of an online bank partnership hypothetically goes bankrupt or out of business?  This question applies to accounts such as Simple + BBVA Compass, Aspiration Summit + Radius, and Amex Serve + American Express National Bank.

* Amex Serve is a prepaid card/account, so it is probably the riskiest here, but they clearly outline the recourse: *""funds will be placed by us into one or more custodial accounts we maintain for the benefit of Accountholders.""*  so the actual bank account is not in the users name, but rather Amex's name, in their FDIC insured accounts.  *""In the unlikely event of our insolvency, funds we place in a custodial account for your benefit should be protected from claims by our creditors; however, it is possible that funds that we hold before placement in a custodial account will not be protected from claims by our creditors.Even if funds in your Serve Account (whether held by us or held in a custodial account) are protected from claims by our creditors in the unlikely event of our insolvency, it is possible that you will not have access to those funds while court or other legal proceedings are ongoing.""*  So due to the account being in Amex's name, the funds are FDIC insured, but the insurance only seems to pass through to the end user if Amex is in good legal standing.  If the specific Amex subsidiary goes bankrupt, it sounds like user funds will be held against Amex's debts. 

* Aspiration is an investment startup, that offers the Summit checking account in partnership with Radius Bank.  With a Summit account, I can log in via both Aspiration's portal, and Radius Bank's portal.  In this partnership, I have an actual account with Radius Bank, opened in my name.  Aspiration, however, is an investment startup that has not been around too long.  Recently they have announced major upcoming changes to the account, 1% APR on all balances, no overdraft fees, etc.  This comes with some major caveats: *""**Deposits or cash balances. . .are eligible for insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) when they are swept to one or more of our Program Banks."" ""Aspiration formerly had a partnership with Radius Bank, member FDIC, which offered the Aspiration Summit Checking Account.""*  It sounds like it is becoming a prepaid card, with the ""Program Banks"" being FDIC insured accounts in Aspirations name, similar to Amex Serve.  Except this would be much scarier, as Aspiration doesn't have a big name like Amex to necessarily bail it out.

* Lastly is Simple + BBVA Compass bank.  Simple is mostly just an online app with great customer support and budgeting, for their partner bank.  They are owned by BBVA, and funds are stored in BBVA Compass, the US branch.  It seems that the BBVA Compass account is in the user's name, but I am not totally sure.  Simple began as a startup prior to the purchase by BBVA.  


Compared to Capital360, Alliant, and other online banks that are online, whilst also being FDIC insured directly; how much riskier are these new age banking startups, that parter with existing banks to store your funds?",finance

personalfinance,Getting a personal loan in the US to repay student loans from the UK - thoughts?,"Hi there personalfinance,

I am originally from the UK, where I studied and have remaining student loans debt which I have continued paying since I moved over to the US. While I am employed and able to pay it off, I am toying with the idea of getting a loan here in the US to then send *back* to the UK and pay off my entire student loan, essentially ""bring my debt over"", for a few reasons: 

1. Notifying the SLC in the UK every time I change job or income is an absolute nightmare as their system is antiquated at best.
2. Adding to the above, keeping track of my remaining debt in the UK is a pain with the antiquated systems, as well as fluctuations in the GBP/USD exchange rates. 
3. The monthly payments I have to make to the SLC are notably higher than they were when I lived and worked in the UK, despite my pay being about the same. I suspect I can get a personal loan here with lower payments making things more manageable.  
4. Bringing my loan to my primary country of residence will avoid me paying any transaction fees caused by sending the money back in bits and pieces (yes, I have services like TransferWise helping keep those costs lower but they are still there). 

Now, I am completely aware that there can be scenarios where this could lead to an inverse of the original problem if I ever needed to move back to the UK - to run out this thought experiment, consider these questions under the assumption that I am going to be living in the US permanently for at least the duration of the loan I take. 

SO, my questions really are:

1. Is this even something I am allowed to do? Will a US institution be able to provide me a loan for this purpose (as it is technically ""consolidating debt"")?
2. Is this even worth doing? The interest rate on my SLC loan in the UK is very low, and I will ultimately be paying more by bringing the debt over, even if I am paying at a more manageable rate. 
3. Has anybody else been in this position/taking this approach, and how did it work out for you? 

Thanks in advance for your time, anyone and everyone!",finance

BlockChain,Democratic Radicalism vs Liberal Radicalism --- A Note on Buterin et al’s “Liberal Radicalism”,"**“Liberal Radicalism: Formal Rules for a Society Neutral among Communities,” Vitalik Buterin, Zoë Hitzig, and E. Glen Weyl (**[**September 2018**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06421.pdf)**)**

&gt;*“How democracy, which is essentially a theory of internal balance, can adapt itself to cover these greater issues, is one of the most challenging political problems ever presented to the mind of man. Needless to say, the immense size of modern states has carried it far beyond the point at which it was meant to be left by Aristotle. Meanwhile, we must guard ourselves against treating the problem as simpler than it really is.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*L P Jacks (1916) “Our Drifting Civilization”*

“In many contexts, a sponsor with capital wishes to stimulate and support the creation of public goods, but is ill-informed about the appropriate goods to create.” Thus begins an ambitious and intense introduction to a funding principle, and to a system “that is as flexible and responsive as the market, but avoids free-rider problems.”

The authors concede that their proposal “may, at first blush, seem strange or abstruse,” but in my world as well as theirs, being described as strange or abstruse is a compliment. Strange and abstruse is not the problem with “LR,” however; and though I am strongly tempted to tackle the paper by flagging each dubious assumption and commenting on each irksome line, I will instead respond obliquely. For a smart summary analysis of Buterin *et al*., see [cryptowander’s 5 Septembr 2018 article](https://our.status.im/liberal-radicalism-a-la-buterin-hitzig-and-weyl/). The postscript to this piece is an introduction to LP Jacks and his 1916 article.

Thirty or more years ago, I sketched a scheme for what I called the “tax ballot.” This was a hasty bagatelle from my youth, and the gist of it was as follows: citizens would receive a form every three years, allowing them to choose how their contributions to state and federal income tax would be used. Each citizen would control precisely where their tax dollars went. The idea was to take allocation out of the political process and away from our elected officials, leaving them to focus on building productive relationships with their communities, and lawmaking.

The Internet was in its infancy, and though I assumed that computers (such as I understood them) could crunch the numbers, I hit a wall when I began thinking about the logistics of *how* this could work. I never pursued the line of thought beyond one very rough draft of a very naive essay, about which I remember very little. What I do remember, though, is wrestling with was the problem of overfunding and underfunding. *What if a majority of people were rabidly hawkish, and wanted 80% of their tax dollars to go to the military? What if too few people wanted their money going towards education?* That would be a disaster.

And that’s what I liked best about the project. A tax ballot wouldn’t achieve “near optimal distribution” of tax dollars (whatever that would be), but it would drive home beautifully what I believed (and still do believe) a large part of democracy is really all about: coping with the wild resource-allocation lottery that inevitably arises when individuals within a massive collection of diverse peoples try to get things to go *their* way, especially when they forget the legitimate interests of their neighbors and neglect the bigger picture.

Democracy is a warts-and-all proposition: we struggle to find it beautiful right up to the moment that we actually do, and when we do it is because of rather than in spite of the imperfections. Democracy — one person, one vote — is the opportunity for *one* shop clerk to contribute to getting things as wrong or as right as *one* CEO. Democracy is punitive in nature; but it is also a hopeful venture. It is the opportunity to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them. It works only when a people enjoys the liberty to talk openly and freely with one another about how we should get it less wrong next time around. To ensure that we do not punish ourselves too harshly, democracy encourages us to get to know our neighbors’ values and understand their claims, and it demands that we explore with one another various and alternative perspectives on “the big picture.” It’s a lot of work, and frankly it is often unpleasant business \[1\]. If I had to pen a tagline for democracy, it wouldn’t be along the lines of *Liberty and Justice for All.* It would be more like *Good luck, Chuck* and *Choose your mistakes wisely*.

In an open society — one in which most individuals really do value toleration, compassion, and bedrock principles like these — we’re expected to agree (tacitly) to bump along with what we each think are the chronic follies of our fellow citizens. That’s the deal. We take sides, and sometimes we abdicate civic responsibility and vote along party lines rather than on the issues; but at the end of the day we agree to accept the foolhardiness of the electorate, which we all agree never gets things perfectly right.

*Optimal?* The “optimal” is nothing more than *better* — as in, *better than last time.* That’s just how it goes.

It’s possible, I suppose, to describe my tax ballot as “pro-decentralization,” insofar as my plan would take allocation away from a “center;” but I’d reject that characterization. What it is, is robustly and radically democratic. Not in the sense of empowering the masses, or aiming at “consensus” (that great chimera); but in the much narrower sense of being individualistic and communitarian at the same time: *my* tax contribution, and therefore *my*decision as to how we spent it; *we the people* look at how well or how poorly *we’ve* funded *our* public goods, *we the people* live with the consequences of our individual decisions, and *we the people* try not to destroy ourselves with poor choices next time around.

*Wisdom of the crowd?* Surely not. Democracy, at least in the case of a large diverse population, is about *the unwisdom of the mass*. That, I suppose, is one of the things LR has set itself against. The spin on Quadratic Voting seems to support the demi-wisdom of the enlightened minority, though, not *We the People*. If I understand the subtext and implications of LR, the authors are punting a hard-nosed schematic for a *post*\-Democracy protocol: LR is a sketch for how voluntary congregations (one’s hip peeps) may achieve near optimal goods-realization within the turbulent protoplasm of non-voluntary aggregations (the tragically unhip society we’re placed in). It is a very forward-looking and visionary proposal.

It is also radically anti-democratic. The authors hope that LR will help liberal leaders “articulate an alternative to the avowedly illiberal world-views espoused by increasingly authoritarian governments in China and Russia” (p.37). But I suspect implementation of LR in the public space would result in nasty, narrow-minded micro hegemonies, albeit decentralized ones. Were these to scale, I doubt they would be preferable to the Rightism about which the authors’ frett, or the mindshare/groupthink cyberauthoritarianism into which LRDAOs would likely slide.

Here’s the thing. Democracy is not a protocol for optimization, and “one person/one vote” it is not a protocol for consensus. *Democracy isn’t a protocol*. It is a commitment to deal with one another and to eschew force as a means of dealing with those with whom we disagree. “1P1V” is a great method for allowing a group to measure *the lack of consensus* in the body-politic, and democracy is the agreement not to trample to death those who lost the vote.

And in any case, the consensus that really matters most isn’t procedural; it is the established and enduring consensus (1) that we do and will agree to do the best we can with the least-bad compromise position we reach, and (2) that our judiciary and other institutions are sufficiently trustworthy, and are capable of providing remedies to our very worst legislative mishaps. But any piece of legislation is always a mishap to someone, and that’s the point. Wherever there is less than full, hot-blooded unanimity, “consensus” is always a degree of resignation. We can code “consensus protocols” for public chains. But there’s no algorithm for coping, and democracy is about coping — and living peaceably with one another as we cope.

Long before the crypto craze and excitement about blockchain tech, there was talk about “consensus” and “decentralization.” Back in 2011, these were among the buzzwords associated with OWS. Blockchain technology, computational “decentralization,” and cryptocurrencies have always been informed by (or: tainted by) sociopolitical theory; and this much can be said for Mr Buterin, co-creator of the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem and thought-leader among the *cypheratti*: he’s not shy about nailing his colors to the mast. Bless him.

Buterin et al’s proposed “design for philanthropic or publically-funded seeding to allow (near) optimal provision of a decentralized, self-organizing ecosystem of public goods” seems to be cut from the same cloth as my “tax ballot” scheme, which is why I have discussed it. I lack the ability to grasp or appreciate their math, and I am therefore in no position to comment at all on whether they have succeeded in offering a solution, or succeeded even in advancing efforts to arrive at one. The authors are scary-smart people, so I suspect they have — at least on paper. To be frank, I wonder whether my inability to understand the math disqualifies me from commenting at all on their work. But I do understand enough to be troubled by almost everything about LR.

The problems with LR begin with the first sentence of the paper: “In many contexts, a sponsor with capital wishes to stimulate and support the creation of public goods, but is ill-informed about the appropriate goods to create.” Surely this cannot be the case. And if I struggled to understand everything subsequent to these words — the authors’ mishmash of math, economics, and sociopolitical theory — perhaps it is because I can’t get my head around the idea of a “sponsor” with capital being “ill-informed” about which projects or causes to support. Nor can I accept the authors’ failure to distinguish between selfishness and self-interest, or their seeming obsession with “free-riders” and “collusion.” With respect to the latter in particular, they have mistaken puzzles for problems, and seem to believe that in solving the former they have resolved the latter — an error to which powerful intellects are prone, and to which economists/game-theory people are particularly susceptible.

The main thing rubbing me raw however is the suspicion that the authors are not in fact motivated by the desire to achieve more “optimal” funding of public goods, but are driven chiefly by the desire to enable the values and interests of the “creative class” to triumph over the values and interests of the less sophisticated, less high-minded members of society \[2\].

&gt;*“Visual artists, game designers, journalists, filmmakers, science fiction authors and more have already started to play a critical role in this communication for other Radical Market ideas (Posner and Weyl, 2018) and we expect that the ambition and novelty of the LR mechanism will inspire more activity in this direction than any of the other, narrower ideas. // Building awareness and understanding of the ideas will, in turn, be a critical basis for and component of activism and organizing aimed at policy change in the LR direction.” (p.37)*

It is interesting that this list (visual artists, game designers, *etc*.) overlaps nicely with those individuals soonest to benefit from distribution and use of blockchain technology. Nonfungible tokens which establish and secure copyright and IP ownership are likely to be the best immediate use-case for public chains, such as the one Mr Buterin helped to create. Coincidence?

And if LR strikes one as strong-arm authoritarianism posturing as emancipation-democracy, that’s not to be wondered at: much of “decentralization” seems to be techno-oligarchism posing in the itchy mantle of liberalism, and privilege masquerading as populism \[3\]. The hardcore who “occupied” Wall Street for the duration of that circus of best-intentions *cum*60s nostalgia clearly didn’t need to punch a clock to keep food on the table, and I for one have a difficult time believing that these sorts know enough about real work to speak for the proletariat. *Carhartum non facit artifex* — The Carhart does not make the worker \[4\].

The reality of the decentralism punted at OWS was nicely observed by [*The Economist* in October of 2011](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2011/10/19/leaderless-consensus-based-participatory-democracy-and-its-discontents):

&gt;*“Even given a climate of ideological similarity, this mode of communal egalitarian living doesn’t tend to scale up well beyond a few hundred people, and requires intense and often invasive surveillance and monitoring to minimise free-riding, as well as heavy communal pressure to maintain the kind of conformity of belief necessary to maintain ongoing consensus. This is not, to my mind, a beautiful dream. Anyway, insofar as people are serious about it, egalitarian participatory democracy points in the direction of radical decentralisation and hyper-local control. The immense scope and diversity of the American territory and population, as well as the vast scale of the American state and the number and complexity of its activities, are fundamentally incompatible with the kind of society now being performed by the romantics in Zuccotti Park.”*

Democratic systems — at least the 1P1V kind — do not, and probably cannot, deliver “optimum results.” None should expect them to. They deliver the bad results a polity deserves, and the kinds of inefficiencies a people must learn to endure, and work together to rectify. *That* is community — though I suspect that when the authors of LR use the word ‘community,’ they mean “community of like-minded people wherever they live on the planet,” and not the sorts of real communities the non-elites of Earth are forced to call home. Again, OWS:

&gt;*“Not only is it hard to see how this worthwhile little experiment in leaderless, consensus-based decision-making is a realistic means to the end of a whole society governed by leaderless, consensus-based decision-making, it’s hard see why this is a desirable end.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Because the participatory democracy of OWS is an ideological endeavour, it can avoid the hard problem of liberal society: the ineradicable diversity of moral belief and the impossibility of consensus. Consensus-based communes composed of individuals who opt in specifically because they already agree with the commune’s founding values can work precisely because the people who would make consensus impossible — people with very different opinions and values — stay away. But not only does the OWS experiment skirt the problem of pluralism through self-selection, the ideological homogeneity of self-selection may make deliberation tend toward extremism…”*

The principle upon which democracy rests is the freedom to make bad decisions, one vote at a time. Quadratic Voting is too clever by half, and I do not believe we need better math and DAOs (*etc.*) to solve the “problems” of civic management and national governance. LR may be a brilliant means of allocating private contributions to good-works, to ends identified by private individuals (and enjoyed most immediately by a small slice of the public). I hope someone tries it. We do however need to remember that democratic *public* institutions “work” only in the sense that they allow people the freedom to hang themself by their own petard.

If however we wish to have people with better values, and would rather have them voting more wisely than swinging from yardarms of their own manufacture, then we need to educate them better. Alas, that requires normative judgments and enthusiastic promulgation of visions of both the right and the good, and few have the stomach for that these days. It may also require the “creative class” to engage rather than wall themselves off from the work-a-day slobs who don’t have Ethereum wallets, don’t frequent boutique art galleries, and who still think that “blockchain” is the way you keep your dog tied-up in front of your double-wide. This, too, is messy (keep your MAGA cap out of my cafe), and perhaps that’s one reason some folks are keen to farm it all out to consensus mechanisms. *In code we trust*. As for the “problem” of “collective organization,” it is (like “consensus”) chimerical — for all but closet authoritarians, that is \[5\].

“Liberal Radicalism” is a work of great intelligence, aye. It may yet become of classic in one or more domains of scholarship. It may in time be cited as evidence that democracy’s ultimate demise was hastened by youthful savants trying to hack “the dismal science” with tools and terms unsuited to the messy business of decision-making and governance.

Either way, understanding LR takes work, a lot of work — and maybe that’s the inside joke: in the future, governance by consensus will be left solely to those who can demonstrate both *proof of work,* and who can afford to purchase their *proof of stake.*

I do hope LR is studied — as an oddity rather than an oracle, and as a symptom of the ills of the age, not as a draft of the cure.

However, when I bought my truck I found out that I have been defaulting on 30k for about 5 years. The 30k are in Federal student loans with interest rates between 2% and 5%, the 10k auto loan is a higher interest rate.

The options I see are either:
A) Pay off the truck and free up my $300 a month to pay the student loans
B) Since the truck is under control, kock off 1/3 of the student loans to get them out of default, and refinance the truck to a lower payment

investing,Late Cycle Signals and Yield Curve Dynamics,"“Everything turns in circles and spirals with the cosmic heart until infinity. Everything has a vibration that spirals inward or outward — and everything turns together in the same direction at the same time. This vibration keeps going: it becomes born and expands or closes and destructs — only to repeat the cycle again in opposite current. Like a lotus, it opens or closes, dies and is born again. Such is also the story of the sun and moon, of me and you. Nothing truly dies. All energy simply transforms.” – Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem by Suzy Kassem

 

“We say that flowers return every spring, but that is a lie. It is true that the world is renewed. It is also true that that renewal comes at a price, for even if the flower grows from an ancient vine, the flowers of spring are themselves new to the world, untried and untested.

 

The flower that wilted last year is gone. Petals once fallen are fallen forever. Flowers do not return in the spring, rather they are replaced. It is in this difference between returned and replaced that the price of renewal is paid.

 

And as it is for spring flowers, so it is for us.” – The Price of Spring by Daniel Abraham

Late Cycle Signals
 

Each business cycle is unique. Certain patterns, however, have tended to repeat across business cycles with the ebbs and flows in the level of economic activity.

 

The late stage of the business cycle is often characterised by an overheated economy, restrictive monetary policy, tight credit markets, low unemployment rates and peaking corporate profit margins.  These are not the types of signals that form part of our discussion on the late cycle this week. Instead we focus on behavioural clues from the financial services and investment management sector that signal that we may have potentially entered the late stage of the business cycle – often the most rewarding, but also the most precarious, phase of bull market for investors.

 

1. Liquidity events for investors in ride hailing services companies

 

Few opportunities have captured the imagination of venture capital investors over the last decade as the one represented by ride hailing services companies such as Uber, Lyft, Didi Chuxing and Grab.

 

Uber Technologies is the most prized of the Silicon Valley unicorns – start-up companies valued at US dollars 1 billion or higher – with a valuation of US dollars 72 billion at the time of its last round of fundraising.
 

Lyft, the number two player in the US ride hailing services market with a rumoured 35 per cent market share, doubled its valuation to US dollars 15.1 billion during its last round of fundraising in July this year.
 

Didi Chuxing, China’s equivalent to Uber and valued at US dollars 56 billion during its last fundraising, is the most valuable start-up on the Mainland and counts Apple, Softbank and Uber amongst its shareholders. The start-up is estimated to have raised US dollars 20.6 billion in funding over 17 rounds of financing.
 

Southeast Asia’s leading ride hailing services company, Grab, was valued at over US dollars 10 billion in a fundraising round in June this year and has received US dollars 1 billion in funding from Toyota.
 

With such eye-popping valuations it should come as no surprise that most, if not all, of the leading ride hailing companies the world over are weighing up potential liquidity events, be it an initial public offering or a trade sale to larger competitors or strategic investors. The investors in these companies are undoubtedly eager to convert their paper profits into realised gains in the form of cold hard cash.

 

Lyft has hired JP Morgan to lead its IPO and is aiming to beat its much larger rival, Uber, in becoming the first ride hailing services company to be publicly listed
 

Uber has reportedly received proposals from Wall Street valuing the company as high as US dollars 120 billion – almost 67 per cent higher than the valuation at its last round of fundraising
 

Didi Chuxing is reportedly weighing up the possibility of a public offering in 2019
 

Careem Networks, the Middle East’s leading ride hailing services company, and Uber are rumoured to be in talks for a possible merger or an outright acquisition of the Middle Eastern business by Uber. Careem was valued at US dollars 1 billion during a fundraising round in December 2016. Bloomberg reported in September that the acquisition of Careem by Uber would value it between US dollars 2 to 2.5 billion – a 100 to 150 per cent increase in less than 24 months.
 

In 2007, The Blackstone Group, the leading alternative asset management firm, successfully listed on the New York Stock Exchange, selling a 12.3 per cent stake in return for  US dollars 4.13 billion. Blackstone’s listing was, at the time, the largest US IPO since 2002.

 

Although Blackstone was able to successfully list, many of its rivals – including Apollo Global Management, Kohlberg Kravis &amp; Roberts and the Carlyle Group – missed the opportunity to float ahead of the global financial crisis and had to shelve their plans and wait for a more conducive environment.

 

We worry that a similar fate awaits the riding hailing services industry, where it becomes a case of one IPO and done and the remaining companies’ plans are delayed by an abrupt end to the current iteration of the US equity bull market.

 

 

2. INVESCO to buy OppenheimerFunds

 

INVESCO, the independent investment company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, this week agreed to buy rival Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance’s OppenheimerFunds unit for US dollars 5.7 billion. According to the Wall Street Journal:

“Invesco will pay for the deal with 81.9 million common shares and another $4 billion in preferred shares, making MassMutual the firm’s largest stockholder. Including OppenheimerFunds, Invesco will manage more than $1.2 trillion in assets.”

In the summer of 2009, BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors, including its highly coveted iShares franchise, for US dollars 13.5 billion and created a combined entity with, at the time, approximately US dollars 2.7 trillion of assets under management.

BlackRock’s timing was impeccable: a near decade long equity bull market ensued and, even more importantly for BlackRock, the company put itself in the prime position to reap the rewards of the rise of passive investing.

The rationale for the OppenheimerFunds acquisition according to the Wall Street Journal paraphrasing INVESCO CEO Martin Flanagan is to: “strengthen Invesco’s position in some businesses that have been proven resilient to the move toward passive investing, including international and emerging-markets stock funds.”

We are curious to see if INVESCO’s decision today turns out to be as flawed as BlackRock’s decision in 2009 was impeccable.

 

3. Middle market alternative asset managers selling stakes

 

In recent years, seemingly successful, mid-sized alternative asset management firms have started selling equity stakes to their much larger, more established competitors such as Neuberger Berman, The Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group.

Dyal Capital, a unit of Neuberger Berman, has closed 30 or more transactions acquiring stakes in alternative asset managers over the last 2 to 3 years, including a strategic investment into Silver Lake Partners. Dyal presently manages three funds with US dollars 9 billion in assets under management and is set to complete fundraising over 5 billion for a fourth fund.

The most recent of such sales comes from New Mountain Capital, which manages private equity, public equity and credit funds with more than US dollars 20 billion in assets under management. The company has reportedly sold a 9 per cent stake to Blackstone Strategic Capital Holdings.

We wonder: what are the chances that highly successful private equity and alternative investment firms would sell their stakes at anything but close to peak valuations?

 

Yield Curve Dynamics
 

Given that we have discussed late cycle signals above, we wanted to touch upon the historical dynamics of the Treasury yield curve when it has either gone (i) from inverted to flat or (ii) from flat to positively slopping.

Prior to sharing our findings, we wanted to share some analysis for the period starting 1959 and ending 1984 from Interest Rates, the Markets, and the New Financial World (1985) by Henry Kaufman:

“If the risk in investing in the long market is still great immediately following the point of maximum inversion, when does the long market offer the best opportunity? To answer this question, it is necessary to examine the swings in the U.S. Government securities yield curve during the past quarter century.

These swings are:

 

from extreme negative (short rates above long) to flat
from flat to extreme positive (long rates above short)
from extreme positive to flat
from flat to extreme negative
 

The results are as follows:

 

1. When the yield curve for government securities swung from extreme negative to flat, long yields actually increased with one exception – the 1980 cycle. In one of these cycles, there was greater rise in long yields than in short rates. In all other instances, however, short rates fell while long yields rose.

 

2. When the yield curve moved from flat to extreme positive, with long yields going above short, in all cycles long yields fell in conjunction with a more sizable drop in short rates.

 

3. The swing from extreme positive to flat can be quite dangerous in the long bond sector. In the four complete cycles… yield increases average 104 basis points for long-term issues, ranging from 40 to 220 basis points.

 

4. The most dangerous period of all for investors in long bonds, however, occurs when the yield curve moves from flat to extremely negative, with short rates moving up above long.”

 

Interestingly, the period around the time of publishing of Mr Kaufman’s book was the exception for how the long end of the curve reacted when the yield curve went from extreme negative to flat. And Mr Kaufman speculated in his book if the long-running bond bear market was over or not. With the benefit of hindsight we know that the bond bear market had indeed ended during the early 1980s.

For the period from 1980 till date and with respect to cycles where the yield curve went either (i) from inverted to flat or (ii) from flat to positively slopping, we make the following observations (based on the yield differential between 2 and 10 year Treasury securities):

 

1980 – 1982: the yield curve went from extreme negative to flat with both short and long rates declining. Short rates declined faster than long rates.
 

1988 – 1992: from flat to extreme positive with both short and long rates declining. Short rates declined faster than long rates.
 

2000 – 2003: from inverted to flat and then to extreme positive with both short and long rates declining. Short rates declined faster than long rates.
 

2005 – 2010: from flat to extreme positive with both short and long rates declining. Short rates declined faster than long rates.
 

In recent weeks we have witnessed the yield curve correct its flattening trend due to a sell-off at the long-end. The yield curve has steepened due to higher long-term yields – a phenomena last witnessed in the 1970s. These are still early days and the recent sell-off at the long-end may be nothing more than a blip. If, however, the yield curve continues to steepen due to increasing long-term yields it would be an ominous sign for bond bulls.

Much like Mr Kaufman speculated that the bond bear market may have ended in the early 1980s, the recent shifts in the Treasury yield curve and the forthcoming supply of US Treasury securities have us wondering if the multi-decade bond market is over.

&amp;#x200B;

My DTI is high due to a very high car payment from me buying a car far out of my leauge. Lucky for me, it was defective from the factory and I am able to return it to GMC with them being willing to pay the loan off in full. This will remove a $69000 loan ($1300 month payment) ffrom my DTI/credit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm approved for up to $31k @ 6.99%, with a maximum carry of 120% for a vehicle.

There is a KIA that has several thousand dollars in rebates bringing the MRSP of $19,135 to $14,000. I've asked they sell me the vehicle @ MRSP and carry up to 120% to pay Tag title ect and give me even more cash back. (essentially selling the vehicle to me for $23K). I will purchase GAP for $300 in the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

My intent is to immediatly  use this cash back to pay off the 25% interest credit card. I will be reducing that payment of $252 to nothing , but will have increased my car loan payment from $239 a month if I bought the car at $14k, to $393 if I loan $23k against the car. 

&amp;#x200B;

So is this a smart move? Should I pay off the 1 very high interest rate card, or peanut butter spread the $9k across all of my credit cards bringing their balance vs maximum ratio back down to 35% for all of them (returning my credit score to a reasonable rate)?

Then the dot-com happened, and I got a job in SF with an amazing relocation package. It just so happened that a friend and co-worker needed a house, so I rented out the house #1 to him, good money, more than paid for the mortgage.

Moved to SF and there I found an incredible deal with a house/condo, which was very sweet also thanks to the generous relocation package.  A few years in SF and a few companies later, I was relocated back to where house #1 is, and I have lived there for about 15 years or so.

Then a few months ago I got relocated to Philly, where I am renting as I settle here.  For the very long future I will remain in Philly, I know that, so eventually in a couple of years I will buy something here, but not just yet. I do have a 2-year lease on my house.

Problem #1: my house #1 is not renting.  It's in a very desirable location for buying, but nobody is renting there.  I could sell it in 1 week, but now it has been on the market for 3 months and no good tenant has submitted an application. Note: I do have a realtor engaged.

Problem #2: Too much of my portfolio is invested in Real Estate, I never meant to be it that way, it just happened that way.

My original plan was to rent out #1 for 2-3 or 4 years, till I was ready to buy in Philly, then sell Chicago and buy something in Philly; same price or slightly less.

But the plan is not working.

So I am thinking about selling Chicago and ""park"" the money for 5 years or longer in $SPY to hedge against gain/losses in the RE market. Or even $SDY and use some of the dividend income to offset my current rent.

I have done some backward comparison using the value of my house and the median price for my town for the past 20/10/5 years compared to SPY/SDY and ... it's not only feasible but advantageous.

Of course, past performance is not an indication of future events. The stock market could experience a correction while the RE market could explode, in which case I'd be f--ed; i they both experience a similar correction it won't be a big deal.

So, what does r/personalfinance think?  I am open to criticism or alternatives.",finance

personalfinance,22k In CC Debt and I am not freaking out. Should I be?,"I do the finances in the house and collectively between my wife and I we have 22k in CC Debt. I feel like I should be freaking out but I am not. I am uncomfortable with the CC debt we are in but feel like I made good financial decisions with the Credit Cards at the time.

One card that we used has an 18 month no interest option that we used and pre-paid off our child's school tuition, car insurance and gymnastics for the year which gave us discounts for paying those in full. Each one was about 2 or 3% and roughly put about 9k on that card but saved 300 dollars doing so by paying in advance. We used the remaining to buy some odds and ends things for home repairs and got that card up to 10.5k. The promotional interest rate ends in November of 2019

The next card is our Amazon Prime card which we have about 1.5k on. The card collects about 25 dollars in interest a month and we put about 350 a month onto paying that off. Our annual subscribe and save is on the card which is about 110 dollars. 

The card that I get stressed about is our capital one card which has about 11k on it and is collecting the full front of interest. Interest is around 200 a month and we have knocked it down from 13k in the past couple months. We used this card for a Disney trip in which we put about 8k on it. We bought luggage, stuff for the house and a few other odds and ends that put the other 5k on it. Basically we got a balance and went wild beyond Disney. I justified Disney because 8k was not a lot to me and I would have been able to pay that off by March. I also justified Disney because we are so strict with our money and our kid is five and we wanted to give them the full Disney experience. We figured what point is living if we are going to be debt free by 36 but didn't enjoy the time until then. With the accrued interest during the time frame I think I could have paid the trip back on it was like taking out a loan at 6% interest which wasn't terrible in my mind. I just feel really guilty about having this much CC debt and feel like I fucked us as a family. Budget wise I think we are fine I just cannot get over the soul crushing guilt of Credit Card debt. Maybe I am not fine with my budget I don't know

We are 30 years old and our incomes together are about 110k a year. 

Our house we owe 50k left and our mortgage is 700 a month


Bills for electric, cell, cable, water, life insurance, gas are 600 a month

My wife's car is paid off

My car is almost paid off with 8k left on the loan and should be paid off 3 years early. 

We have no other outstanding debt other than some student loans that I will have to pay on once I finish grad school

At the end of the day with our bi-weekly paychecks we have about 2k a month to go towards un-budgeted debt/fun/gas/food. I think we are fine but just am not sure. 


Edit: thank you for the advice I did a balance transfer on the one card that is accrueing interest so that it is 0% apr for 18 months. We will still try to pay it off by March but I feel a little bit less under the gun. Will watch those cards in the future they are easy to get out of hand",finance

*How will it impact my credit? (Should this even be a concern, given my high balances, high interest rates and no end in sight?)
*What factors should I consider when determining which company to consolidate with?
*What are the negative aspects of consolidation? (Longer re-payment term, will I end up paying more in total, albeit with a lower interest rate,?)

I have a $1600  bill for the Chase Amazon Prime cc that I can't pay because I've been out of work for two months due to an injury. I have been getting disability checks but they aren't much. I know this debt is pretty small compared to some of the other numbers I've seen here, but it's still factoring into my credit and causing me to stress a bit. My score is hovering around 670-650.

I think the best plan of action would be to transfer the balance to another card, with a 0% intro interest rate for at least 12 months. I signed up for the Chase Freedom Unlimited and was approved (with a $1k limit), but foolishly did not know that one cannot transfer from Chase to Chase.

I'm looking at the AmEx Everyday cc since I got an offer from them in the mail. My only concern is that I will be approved but with a low limit. I really don't want a crazy high limit. I want at least enough to transfer the entire balance over.

How are AmEx with their limits usually? Honestly, I'm so new to this credit thing, I'm not sure how they determine the credit limit.

personalfinance,(ZA) Save money in American account as non-citizen?,"Hi all. Not sure if this is the best subreddit but it seems to be the most relevant one for me. Basically, I'm a South African citizen(born here) hoping to move to America(or at least Canada) at some point in the mid-term future. I'm a student at a software development school with a guaranteed entry-level job on completion from my sponsor(it's a scholarship program). I plan to start saving the majority of my salary as soon as I get my career started so that I will be able to move as soon I get the opportunity. Starting salary for software development in South Africa is roughly ZAR 20,000(USD 1,400) My monthly expenses would only be around ZAR 6,000(USD 400) a month as I plan on living with my parents as long as possible and they are fairly financially stable leaving around ZAR 14,000(USD 1000) per month for savings. South African interest rates are quite good(I can get a long-term savings account that will get me back almost 10% per year). However, our economy is pretty screwy and faith in the Rand and the Gov't is rapidly declining so I'm worried about losing too much money over time due to devaluing of the ZAR. Worst case out economy completely crashed and our currency loses all practical value(not implausible at this point. South African government is doing some really Zimbabwe-esque things.) So far predictions are optimistic but it's still pretty volatile for my liking. Anyway, Ranting about South Africa aside, I am seriously considering saving in an offshore account. What exactly are my options? Given that I hope to immigrate to America, that would be my first choice of currency to save in. My basic questions are:
1. Should I stick to my home-currency with high interest rates and low fees(don't have to transfer money offshore every month) or would I be safer with a low-interest(1.5% or so) account from a US bank? I personally feel more confident in the US account despite the transaction fees and low interest.
2. If I decide to open a US account(the way I'm currently leaning), is it possible as a non-resident? I have family in the states so should I ask them to open the account on my behalf? Is this legal? Would I be able to still have access to the account from overseas from internet banking or such? What would be the best way to transfer the money to the US over time?
3. Are there any other options I should consider instead? (European or Scandinavian account possibly?) I would prefer something more liquid so that should an emergency arise, it could double as my emergency fund.

TL;DR:
I want to save money overseas as I'm losing faith in the stability of the ZAR and I want to save up to immigrate to America as soon as an opportunity presents itself. What are my options? I have family living in USA. Interest would be great but stability would be better. I want a fairly liquid form of storage so I can get access to the funds within a month at most should an opportunity/emergency arise.",finance

personalfinance,"Freshman in college, terrified of future student debt. Steps to take now?","Hello everyone, this is my first time on r/personalfinance and I figured this might be a good place to start for some of my student debt questions. Sorry in advance for a lengthy post, I want to put in all information I can and I'll add a tldr; too.

 So first of all I am a freshmen in my first semester at a four year public university. I am pursuing a major in political science, with a concentration in international relations, and most likely a minor in east Asian languages and culture (with a focus on the Chinese language). As a freshman I currently have 3 federal loans taken out, a parent plus loan totaled at around 20,000$ (7.6% interest rate), one direct subsidized loan totaled at around 1,000$ (5.05% interest rate) and one subsidized loan totaled around 1,700$ (again 5.05% interest rate). I have no savings to pay for these loans and money that I do have saved from my part time job from this past summer is for living expenses. I imagine that these numbers will stay around the same (with slight fluctuations) all four years at my university, leading me to owe right around 91,000$ at the end of my four years without interest. If I get the job that I am aiming for right out of college I would make around  46,967$ a year in salary. 

I am a very conservative person with my money and the thought of being in student debt will give me random spikes of paranoia in the middle of the night or throughout the day. So my main question is, what steps can I take to ease my paranoia and is it even worth having and will my prospective starting salary even help that much to diminish my debt? My biggest fear is still being in debt and having to take on more debt (buying a house, car payments, etc.) 10, 15 years down the line and having to postpone dreams that I have just to pay off debt (like starting a family, travelling). I know there are scholarships that I am actively looking at, and I plan on getting a job at college once I'm finally acclimated (I'm thinking second semester), but is there anything else I could be doing? Other students around me don't seem to be worried with having 130,000$+ in debt (more debt due to their major), but their projected salaries after graduation are closer to 75,000$ a year. Is there anything else I can do to stop my paranoia? Thank you for any responses!

tldr; After four years of university I'll have close to 100,000$ in student debt with a projected salary of 46,000$. What can I do to help myself as freshman now and help ease my paranoia?",finance

personalfinance,"Car was stolen, not sure what direction to go in next","So just this past weekend, my 2000 Honda Civic was stolen in front of my friends house sometime between Saturday night and Sunday morning. It was a great car, I had been driving it since I was 15, and I'm 25 now. It was in excellent shape both inside and out, and only had 130k miles. It was very well maintained. Needless to say I had no plans on buying a new car for 5-10 years.  

Well, after having the car stolen I now face the dilemma of what to do next. For context, I am single, 25 years old, and living in California with my parents who refuse to accept rent from me. I graduated from college two years ago with $46k in student loans (and another $50k in college parent loans in my Dad's name that he keeps telling me not to worry about -- but I cant let him get away with that). My Civic was completely paid off and I had no car payment.   

I have been working full time now for about a year and a half, starting at $50k and now making $63k before taxes, or about $4000 per month after taxes. I have been paying down my $46k in student loans rather vigorously in the past year and a half, and have about $13.6k remaining which I had planned to complete by April or May.   My credit score is currently somewhere between 735-755, and I am also a member of a Police Credit Union which has some connections to dealerships where they can help me to achieve a low interest rate on a new car purchase.

Now faced with the situation of not having a car, I am trying to decide if I should buy: A) a used car on Craigslist or something similar, B) a newish used car from somewhere like Enterprise, or C) just buy a new car altogether. Since I really had NO plans whatsoever of having a car payment (it wasn't even a blip on the radar for me -- I didn't plan on buying a new car until I absolutely needed one or until I had a family), I am unsure of what direction to go in. Part of me wants to buy a new car or a nicer lightly used/new car that could serve as a family car down the road, with the benefit being that the payments would help to strengthen my credit score and I could also put myself in a situation where this nice, family car is actually paid off before or during the time that I am looking for a house.   

Or I could go the route of buying a cheaper used car and hope that it doesn't need much maintenance or repairs down the road, which might be a gamble. But the way I see this option is that I'd just be delaying the purchase of a new car and sinking money into a car that I might not really want and one that may have more problems. Honestly, buying a car like this would feel like a kick in the stomach after having such a great and sentimental car in my Civic. With a new car, I would imagine having a warranty to cover some of the issues that may come up.  

Ultimately I am just unsure of what to do next, as I had not been planning on having a car payment of any kind for at least another 5 years, and I'm still getting over the fact that my perfectly good car is just gone. I generally prefer to pay off any debt as fast as I possibly can, as long as I have a rainy day fund available. For example, I have saved about $10k and won't dip below that number while paying off my student loans as fast as possible.   

One thing I could do is buy a newer car, get it financed, and pay the minimum on that until my loans are paid off, and then focus on the car. Having a newer car would be ""nice"", but if I still had my perfectly good Civic, buying a new car would be absolutely unnecessary, which is why this is so disappointing. But this may be the best option for me, since it would both help my credit score in the long run and possibly provide me with a paid off family car for another 10-15 years when I would need money for the house payment and other things. I figure yeah, I can technically afford to do this, but it ultimately will set me back about \~20k or more in savings at a time where I really dont have much saved at all. It would also set me back quite a bit on how long it would take for me to pay off my loans, since I'd be throwing a handful of money on the car payment that otherwise wouldve went directly to my student loans. I was really looking forward to paying off my student loans by April or May and looking forward to finally saving some money.

However, I haven't saved much money to invest or anything because I figure it's my college years and try to do fun trips while I can and I go out to eat or purchase my own food to cook because our dining facility is atrocious (I also have a girlfriend whom I go out with often). Because of my lack of debt I feel like I'm already miles ahead of the financial game compared to most of my peers. That's some of the context, now on to my question!

&amp;#x200B;

As a cadet at a military academy I am given the opportunity to take a $36,000 loan at a 0.75% interest rate. Since I don't really have any expenses should I take this loan and just put it in the stock market or bonds or something? Or should I not take it so I can budget a few hundred a month to just save up and invest that? I've gotten very conflicting advice from people who don't really know what they're doing from what I can tell.

investing,Looking for the best fixed income on Vanguard,"My goal is a fixed income instrument that will return the highest percent while keeping my principal completely secure. Essentially I'm looking for a higher % yield savings account in essence.

I've been looking over the fixed income ETFs and Mutual Funds and it seems there are some really nice ones. For example 

&gt; BLV: 30 day SEC yield
&gt; as of 10/18/2018
&gt; 4.18%

So if I understand correctly this is returning 4.18% per year in yield? And it's 100% a liquid ETF anyone can buy and sell at any time. And you're not going to lose any principal either?

Would love if an experienced fixed income person chimed in.

What is the difference between holding my money in the federal money market fund where I kept some money to grow at about 2% annually over putting into BLV?

Or how about VCLT, 4.81%! That seems awesome.",finance

personalfinance,"Expecting a windfall, how's my plan?","So, my grandmother has had a trust set up for me for a long time, and now she feels that I'm capable of making good decisions with the money. She has told me that when it ""matures"" in March, she will ""give it to me"". She has always been vague about the rules and has never given me any documents, so I really don't know what this all entails or how much money there is. I have used 20k a couple years ago to pay off a high interest student loan, so there's likely less than 50k, BUT I really don't know. 

I've read through the wiki on windfalls and how to handle $, and want to make sure I'm on the right track. Also, any advice for how to report this on my taxes when the time comes would be much appreciated. This all depends on how much money I actually receive - if it is small I will skip steps and/or not reach step 5.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 1: Complete my emergency fund

Step 2: Pay off my student loans? (they are government loans with low interest rates, I could afford to stretch them out a bit)

Step 3: Buy a reasonable, more reliable car (skip this step depending on $ amount)

Step 4: Set up Roth IRA

Step 5: Invest

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying not to get excited and have low expectations for the amount I get because I don't want to catch myself wanting to spend a lot. I thought about starting a fund for grad school, and I should probably do that over buying a car, but my make and model has known transmission issues and could start causing me real trouble any day now.",finance

Would that make financial sense or should I just continue with the payment plan they are offering and just pay off the loan over time?

personalfinance,Am I being taken advantage of?,"I work in a small accounting department (4-6 employees) for a large not for profit company. I started this job less than a year ago and recently became the head of the department for what was supposed to be a fairly short time due to the finance manager leaving for a new position. It has been over two months and there hasn’t been any indication of the company looking to hire someone to fill his role. The department was already short staffed before my former boss left and now I’m in a position that I didn’t want to be in, overwhelmed with little support. I have taken on the additional responsibilities of having to call the shots all while still having to maintain my original duties. I haven’t received any additional compensation and I’m afraid that if I ask for a raise and get one, they’ll take even longer to fill the position. I’ve expressed my concerns numerous times to both higher ups and the HR department but nothing seems to be changing.

personalfinance,Did I sign up for a scam? (Student loan refinancing program question),"BACKGROUND

(1) Are there a prevalence of federal student loan refinancing scams out there? I'm worried that i have actually signed up one.

(2) I received a call from Federal Student Help in Sarasota, FL (does anyone know them?) in March of 2017 stating that they could help me enroll in the Pay as You Earn program through a bill that Obama signed in 2012. Then I worked at Target and made less than $20k a year so through this program, I would end up paying $0 a month while in the program. THE KICKER HERE is that I have to pay them $750 in order to sign up with the program. I did it last year and now they are asking me to RECERTIFY FOR $600.

MY MAIN QUESTIONS

(1) Is this a scam?

(2) If not, can I sign up for the Pay As You Earn program myself and bypass all the help they give me?

Edit: For the record, I have 8 federal loans that they consolidated last year but the whole thing seems a little fishy.

personalfinance,tackling my student loans?,"I currently have student loan that has been pushed to Navient.  I've had this loan since I was about 22 (am 34 now).   Here are the loans as viewed in my Navient account:

$4,718.91 @ 6%  

$6237.55  @ 6.8%  

$4538.51 @ 5.6%  

$1431.72 @ 4.5%  

$5,562.24 @ 6.8%  

$2,544.84 @ 6.8%  

Total $25,033.77  

&amp;#x200B;

So as of about 5 years ago, I'd never made any payments to the loan due to simply not being able to afford it due to low paying jobs.  This caused my credit to tank for years of non payments. After starting my new job, I was in a bit better of a position to start putting something down, and I entered a loan rehabilitation program. This brought me back to positive standings with my credit score.   It was also around this time that I was promoted at work, but the promotion was a little wonky. Long story short, my job is holding back my professional development and despite hiring me for one position, they needed help with someone elses job, in which I have been doing for the last 3 1/2 years. Unfortunately this comes with the consequence of no promotions, because I haven't actually started the job I was initially hired to do.   

&amp;#x200B;

With the idea that I was going to be receiving a nice promotion in a year or two once things settled down with the other position, and knowing that I couldn't currently afford the minimum payments on my loan, I opted for a few years of forbearance, and ultimately this was the last year that I could apply for forbearance.  I must start making payments on the loans as of November.   Unfortunately, my job has continued it's same shenanigans and has yet to let me start on the job they hired me for despite having great reviews each year, and totally decimating the work that they do hand me (I guess I do this job too well...)  

&amp;#x200B;

My grandmother passed away last year -- she had supposedly left me money (unfortunately not in the will) to help me take care of my student loans. While my aunts / mom have received their money, my mom is not exactly sure whats going on with the other money that was supposed to go to me, and my aunt that is in charge of this isn't someone who I speak with frequently, or ever.  There is some talk that due to taxes I might receive it at the end of this year, but I really am not sure what exactly is going on with this scenario.  

&amp;#x200B;

My original idea was to bust my ass, build up my credit as best as I could -- find out what kind of settlement offer I could get, then request a loan through my bank.  Well, I definitely busted my ass and worked on my credit for these past few years. I took my credit score from the low 400s up to 797 through whatever my bank uses and 760 through whatever Mint uses.  With the idea that I am also receiving some money from my grandmother (maybe... at some point, who really knows), I would then just pay off what I owed to the bank when I receive that money.   I do know that whatever portion of my loan gets 'settled' then I would then owe that on taxes as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my question here is -- considering the several loans that I have ranging from 4-6.8% Interest Rate, is requesting a settlement a good move? Is it even possible to request a settlement while you're in forbearance? I feel like somewhere I have read that loans only have the option to be settled if I have defaulted on payments.    The other question is, if I don't opt for a settlement, would it be a smart move to try and request a private loan and pay navient off in full, and start the payment process through my bank?   I know my credit score is much higher than it was, but I am not entirely certain that if my score is at a point where I could potentially get a cheaper interest rate than the 6%s that I have.  

&amp;#x200B;

I do apologize if I rambled a bit. I tried to add as much detail as seemed important to the question asked.  If I am missing any important detail, please let me know so I can add it in. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*added note\*\* I do make a decent salary, but unfortunately I live in SoCal which is an expensive area and I have bills that the creditors don't take into consideration when it comes to 'financial hardship' (rent/car/dental/medical) that pretty much eat up my entire paycheck, so making the minimum payment of $350-400 is extremely difficult as that starts to cut into food/gas money (not to mention, this is the minimum payment, so I don't think it would even cover the accumulative cost of interest). I don't really have a life outside my home and office, so I do tend to be pretty frugal with the little bit of money that I do have leftover.

personalfinance,Prioritizing student debt payments while back in school,"I am back in school getting a programming degree. I have student debt leftover from my bachelors degree, some in federal loans and one private loan. The federal loans automatically went into deferment when I started school back up (working on paying the new school costs as I go), but obviously the private loan continues to be due. I typically subscribe to the Dave Ramsey way of handling debt, at least I try to.

Thus far I have continued to make payments as I had always done.

My question:  Do I just focus on the private loan and put all of my resources into paying that off first? Or do I keep paying on the deferred loans and just paying it all off a little slower, while any additional amounts go toward the private loan?

I tend to think it makes more sense to attack the private loan (which is also smaller) like Dave Ramsey says to do and not pay anything on the deferred loans until I completely pay off the private loan, which I forgot to add is also a variable interest rate. Is there any issue doing that which I might be seeing?",finance

personalfinance,Which is smarter: paying off student loans or saving for adult life?,"**Generally speaking**, which is a smarter financial move: **paying off your student loans** as quickly as possible to be debt-free, OR aggressively **saving for adult life events**, such as getting married, buying a home, having kids, etc.?

**Details if interested:** 

I've been working for 2 years now and have saved up approximately $20,000 in a savings account with 1.8% APY. These savings include: 6-month emergency fund, down payment for a new car, a kitten, and half of an engagement ring. I plan to save about $12,000 a year, which will increase with my salary.

I have about $29,000 left in student loans. I'm currently paying the minimum amount on the highest interest rate loan group, which is 6.8%. My loans are on the standard 10-year repayment plan.

At age 25, my goals are to get married, buy a home, and maybe start a family in the next 5-or-so years (let's face it, this probably will not happen, but I want to be prepared in case it does. This is my millennial cynicism coming out). 

If I decide to pay off my student loans within the next five years, I will emerge into my 30's with essentially no savings (except for 401k).

If I save aggressively for these large adult purchases, my student loan balance will go down, but I will still have a significant amount of debt in 5 years' time. (I haven't done the math yet of what my student loan balance will be in 5 years if I continue paying the minimum amount every month, but I'll assume that my balance will somewhere in the ballpark of $15,000.)

I would rather have a significant down payment for a home than be student loan debt-free when I'm 30. Maybe I just answered my own question, but I'm curious to see what ""real"" adults think of this situation that my peers are trying to decide too.

Dear Bitcore Community,

We have started our outreach program in Venezuela on October 14 with  an educational seminar in Valencia, one of the most important cities in  this country. This seminar was co-sponsored with other blockchain  platform looking the same goal: teach people about blockchain tech and  cryptocurrencies and help them to start in this amazing new opportunity.  This event broadcasted live on youtube. Venezuela will be BTX´s  territory!

https://i.redd.it/s8qclnnnlxt11.png

With more than forty people we started this program in Venezuela, a  country we love and believe in, for its natural wealth and above all for  its wealth of talent and desire.

A varied audience witnessed this event in which we explained from  scratch everything basic to understand, use and protect in the world of  crypto coins, of course, there is much more but with the tools provided  any person of any age can clearly understand what this world is all  about.

https://i.redd.it/k5pvw5zolxt11.png

https://i.redd.it/0jg4ztjqlxt11.png

The vast majority of attendees haven’t used crypto coins before this  seminar and it was a fundamental part of this program to educate and  introduce people in this world in a correct, clear, honest and simple  way so that they can take advantage in a world of opportunities that are  and will be presented here in Venezuela and in the world.

personalfinance,Refinance Auto Loan or Wait,"I bought a new car in May of this year (for honestly a bit more than I *should* have, but it was a birthday gift to myself for securing a good job and escaping an abusive household), and I'm considering refinancing it to attempt for a lower interest rate. My FICO is 727 according to Discover, and my current loan for it is:

Remaining Principle: ~$19,000    
Remaining Months: 61     
Interest: 6.44%    
Monthly Payments: $360

My plan was to possibly refinance into a 60-month loan since I can very likely get a lower interest rate, continue putting the $360 on it every month, and pay it off early via the Avalanche Method (estimated ~35 months from now after factoring in the $270 monthly payment I make on a loan that will end in April of next year). However, I don't know enough about finance and credit to know if refinancing after only 6 months is a good idea. I'm also moving into an apartment next week, so I don't know how that will effect things either.

Any help is appreciated. I've been putting together Excel spreadsheets to figure out when I'll be completely debt-free, so I figure it's a good time to try to find other ways to bring the date closer.

Fixed interest rate- As low as possible  
10 year term  
No early-payment penalty  

  
  
We are going to our local credit union on Saturday morning, as they advertise 4.75% APR for our situation based on their website calculator. Nerd Wallet listed Flagstar Bank as another viable option. 

**Other possibly related info:**  
Our only other debt is the mortgage at 4.125% and an additional $17k in federal student loans at around 4%  
Wife and I both have 800+ credit scores  

I think I have a pretty good plan in place, but does r/personalfinance have any feedback for me?  
Is there anything I should keep in mind while I meet with the bank on Saturday?  
Has anyone used Flagstar or some other lender that I should investigate?

Bitcoin,Let's support Luke Dashir (one of the top ten Bitcoin contributers) to allow him to continue his work with a universal basic income,"Yesterday on New York Bitcoindevs meetup in the discussion about the recent inflation bug Matt Corallo [stated that many  people would be happy to hire talented open source developer](https://twitter.com/renepickhardt/status/1054520840216367104) to improve the future development of bitcoin.

Luke Dashjr came forward [stating](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1054545007418507264) that:

&gt;I'm now at 8 months with no success in finding new funding for my work on Bitcoin (and have as a result had to redirect more attention toward paid work, and less on Bitcoin itself).

In the discussion following up people encouraged people like him and me\* to to set a patreon page.  [Luke actually set up the patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/LukeDashjr) (see here for a [proof of authenticity](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1054722035316854785))

Luke is currently the[\#9 contributer to bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors) (by counting his +300 contributions). And one can clearly see that the amounts of countributions declined in recent months.

[Luke also provied a Bicoin address](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1054729831731085314): 19BFaR2QsQsYr8qxFtt1izc3rErvWntkwT

&amp;#x200B;

Own opinion (being a developer): Realizing that a developer with Luke's skill set could probably easily score a 10k USD monthly paycheck we can imagine how much he contributed to bitcoin over the last years! So I hope the community will show gratitude especially for a person that already proofed to provide so much great work.

&amp;#x200B;

\----- footnote

\* Personally I am very lucky and grateful that fulmo lightning (the organizer of the lightning hackdays) is sponsoring my open source activities. It does not compare to a developers paycheck but I can survive on it and do what I think is important for lightning so I am fine.

\*\* edit: To be clear I am not working on UBI either: What I meant is that the community would trust Luke to work on the right Bitcoin related tasks. No one telling luke do this specific task otherwise funding dries. Maybe using the term UBI was missleading. (Sorry for that.)",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Renegotiated my interest rate and it worked.,"I forgot what post it was that mentioned that one can renegotiate interest rates after a certain amount of time with a lender. As a college student, I have only two credit lines and one is near to maxed, silly mistake on me, yet I have been consistent with payment and never missed a single one. I reached out to my lender, and asked if I could get a lower rate. They said they only do it for people who are going through a financial hardship which, I am not to be frank but told a little white lie. From my interest being 21.99% it got dropped to 16.99%. Granted, my account is suspended for the next 12 months, I am not upset as I don't plan on using the card and only paying it off within the 12 month grace period I am being given.",finance

personalfinance,Lease or Finance a new car?,"Hey Reddit, I made a bad car purchase decision earlier this year and I am very unhappy with my vehicle. I am considering selling it and either paying off what's left of the car loan, or using the money towards my next vehicle (more on this later).

I am currently looking at a different vehicle from a different dealer. I've looked online and gotten several tentative offers which seem very well priced ($33,000 out the door being one of the best so far). The car (a Honda Clarity Plug-in), also comes with a Federal $7,500 tax credit as well. 

But I also looked at the car leasing options online and it has a 36 month residual value of 44% and MF is 0.00071. I've seen several (seemingly) good specials for leasing it as well. While the dealerships get to keep the tax credit, the dealerships I am working for will knock $7,500 off the value of the car for a lease. So, assuming the 33,000 out-the-door offer, if I chose to lease the vehicle, I would be looking at the car value starting around $26,000. 

I did the rough math, and it looks like I'd have post-tax car payments of around $285/month. 

$285 * 36 months = $10260 + ~$2,000 (fees + down-payments/security deposit)

With a 44% residual, at the end of the loan, the car would only be worth $11440. 

If my ultimate goal is purchase a car I plan on keeping for 8+ years, wouldn't it make more sense to lease and then purchase the car vs purchasing it from the start? $23,700 (lease + purchase) vs $33,000 (purchase)

I was always told that if you plan on purchasing a car for long term use, then you should avoid car leases as they were ultimately more expensive. But this seems like a really good deal, I assume I must be doing my math incorrectly, or I am overlooking something important. 

I would love some outside help to clarify my options and provide advice. Is leasing worth pursuing if I plan on buying out the car at the end of the lease? What are the risks or concerns I should be aware of?

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"Trying to build up credit safely, laying groundwork for age of accounts","I'm 28 and have been at my first post-collegiate job for exactly a year, so I'm getting a feel for what my expenses are and what I can afford to pay off. I currently only have one credit card to my name, which has a delightful 20% interest rate that I used poorly while in college. I've been able to allocate triple my monthly minimum to carve off $500/mo of principal but it's still going to take a few years to pay it off.

I just applied for a credit card through my credit union, and was approved for a card that has the following perks

-0% interest for 12 mos

-3% balance transfer fee

-credit limit that is high enough to transfer 95% of my current balance

-11% interest after 12 mos

So it's going to be excellent because I'll be able to double my line of credit (and lower my credit utilization), remove debt from the card my parents cosigned on when I was 18, and pay it off in just over a year. The only drawback is that I have &lt;5 accounts on my credit report, and 2 of them are now closed from when I refinanced my student loans and another will close when I pay my car off in a year.

I've heard about churning, and how it works well because if you have several hard credit checks in semi-quick succession, it can appear that you're shopping around and can have less of an impact on your credit score... So, taking that logic in a smaller step, would it be beneficial to apply for one or two store credit cards for places I frequent already? My average age of accounts is already low because of my age, so I feel that another 0yr age or two won't really hurt and will help to lay a sturdy foundation for later on in life, assuming I keep frequenting the same places (like Sam's Club).

Am I misunderstanding the concept, or is my plan actually... not a terrible one? Or is there a better way to go about this?",finance
personalfinance,Should I co-sign on my sister's nursing school loan? (MO),"I'm 34 and make just under $40k a year. I have no real assets and live in an apartment with a paid off car. I do have some CC debt but I have outstanding credit. 

My sister is 23 and in a BSN program and has a 3.92 GPA. She's taken out barely any loans but needs about $15k more to finish and just canNOT work anymore these last 6 months of the program than she already is. 

My mother can potentially co-sign and isn't opposed to it but there are two issues there: 1. her credit is decent (EDITED) but already heavily utilized as we're a huge family (I am the oldest). 2. My mother is in remission from pancreatic cancer, has recently broken a hip and received a pacemaker. Things are not looking good. My sister did say (and we know this is dark), if our mother is the one who signs and she passes, the loan would be forgiven.

It's a Federal Plus loan at 7.6%, fixed over 10-25 years. Interest accrued on principal balance from date of disbursement.

Just running my options here. Please give any and all advice as I have rehabilitated my credit myself over the last 5 years from my own terrible choices (not really school but financial immaturity) and don't have a ton of knowledge about this.

This isn't something I'd normally consider except that I know this is a quality degree program and she's doing well in it so I feel confident she'd be able to pay it but I don't want my personal bias to affect this decision (too much). Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,"pay cash for car vs financing and investment, versus current interest rates","Hi everyone, long-time lurker, infrequent poster.

Following other advice in here, aside from the cash on hand I explain below, I also have a 401k maxed, an IRA maxed, over a year of emergency fund for mortgage and bills, and other investments along the ""core four"" stuff I've seen in here.

I'm getting a new car next week and have a dilemma and could use some advice on how best to use some cash for the vehicle. (my current car is a few years overdue for replacement)

Specifically, I'm looking for help understanding some financial math around interest rates of ""should I finance the new car and put cash in some alternate investment, and if so, where"" or ""should I just pay cash for the car"".

More background:

We're in the middle of a kitchen remodel on our house right now and our HELOC is paid off (more construction coming though, which is why we have the HELOC).

Part of our remodel includes all new kitchen cabinets and IKEA wouldn't take a HELOC check, so we ended up with a ""project"" credit card and immediately charged $20k on the $25k limit, so the utilization immediately was at 80% and their billing cycle started a day later. The 80% utilization of this new account dropped my credit score about 40 points from 830 to 790. I was pissed to say the least as I take very good care of our credit. I never use my credit cards to that level, but we were in a time crunch. I paid the $20k balance immediately out of remodel savings, but that zero balance won't reflect on my credit report until sometime late November or December and I can't delay getting the new car beyond next week.

With this hit, I'm a ""B"" rating, at best, when a car dealership pulls my credit next week.

I have the cash to pay for the car outright, but with interest rates up this year already, I'm worried I'm going to get hit with a 5%-ish loan on the car if I finance. I won't know until I get the car next week whether the dealer has any sort of 0% financing deals... And I'm not knowledgable enough yet to find investments that will do better than 5% over the life of a car loan to finance the car and come out money ahead.

I'm happy to provide a little more detail if anyone needs it to help with the math on this.

At what car loan interest rate should I just pay cash for the car?

If you think I should finance and invest the money elsewhere, what would you recommend to keep up with interest rates in the 4%-6% range over the life of a car loan? (my last car loan was 5 years and I paid it in 3)

personalfinance,Refinancing Student Loans,"I, like many people, am a Sallie Mae slave and they’re terrible. My interest rates are all currently an average of 9%, and after having paid off one tiny $1000 some loan, the interest has already rendered that payment useless. My minimum monthly payments are so high that feel like I’m never going to pay off my debt unless I refinance. However, I’ve heard a lot of stories that don’t  convince me either way. 
Some people have no issues with it and end up saving thousands. Others have awful stories about tax breaks, being lied to, it being a scam, etc. I don’t want to get myself in another shitty situation in my desperate attempt to escape Sallie Mae, but at this rate I’m also ensuring my inability to ever purchase a car or house in the future. 
I’ve looked into SoFi and they seem to be the highest recommended, but I guess I’m wondering if anybody had had experience refinancing, if it’s worth it, and/or if you’ve worked with SoFi?",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth buying in the Boston area next year with interest rates rising or wait for a higher DP in 2020 and possibly a better rate situation? Can we afford this?,"So we have plans to buy a 3 bed SFH after our lease is up next summer with a 10% down payment with a mortgage+extras payment at less than 4x annual gross income currently. We are 25 with no outstanding student loans and a car payment of $200/mo for a 2018 Prius at 0.9% interest. (I gave my 2012 paid-off car to my parents when my dad got cancer and their car died. In exchange they pay the cell phone bill for the next few years. It's not even but that wasn't the point.)

So now I have a car payment but it was worth helping my parents in a time of need. Otherwise we currently pay $1600 for rent with a friend/roommate that pays the other portion. This helps us save as we have 9k/mo take home after tax and deductions. My job doesn't give benefits and my husband puts 15% into retirement. It was at 25% until we decided to save for a house. Full budget below, to the best of my ability to estimate. I recently finished my masters, which is why we only have 8k in liquid savings right now. Since the car DP and a small amount of CC debt being paid from while I was without work, we've been able to save a lot each month.

Anyway, the crux of the issue is that I'm already unsure about the affordability of buying. My husband's hobbies very much require it as we grew up in rural areas with a lot of space that he took advantage of. I also want more space to work since I'm remote. Yet, the Boston market keeps rising in costs, we keep losing out on neighborhoods we like, and by the next summer we'll only have enough for 10% down. With interest rates on the rise, that lowers our purchasing power. I'm also afraid that I'm buying high, which counters financial advice. At the same time, how much of a difference does it make if we're going to be living there for decades? We're tied to the area for family and health reasons. Our mortgage will be $2.5k or less and that leaves $1.5k for throwing more at principal plus maintenance based on our current savings rate for the house, minus $200 for the train.

Budget (est.):
$1.6k rent
$75 electric and cable
$0 train- husband walks, I'm remote
$250 insurance
$200 car
$200 entertainment
$150 eating out
$400 groceries
$300 misc.
$100 presents per month over the course of a year
$50 gas (at most)
Subtotal: $3,325
$4000 house fund in high interest savings account (at least)
Subtotal: $7,325
The rest to easily accessible savings/checking for emergencies.

Monthly income, take home:
Husband: 3.7k
Self: 5.3k
Side projects: $200/mo (hopefully rising!)

Also my husband works for a non-profit but plans to get a new job at some point. He's a data analyst and should expect a pay raise of $1.25k+/mo but wants to stay where he is currently to see through a couple projects over the next year that he has substantially contributed to, so no hopping for a year or two.

Main questions:
1. Is it irrational to fear the costs associated with ownership of a $400-450k house with our income/situation? 

2. Should we wait for a better time to buy with rising interest rates or is that silly in the long run?  Boston hasn't declined in a long time but there's still this feeling of a peak.

3. By next summer, when we would look to buy 90 days before the lease is up, we will have a 10% DP. Waiting another year would give us easily 20%. Any benefit to waiting on this front?

4. If we have a child in the coming couple of years, would that change your advice? We aren't materialistic people but some costs are unavoidable for kids. We do plan to save first but we don't really know what to expect with medical bills or other surprises. Parents are within 100 miles but not within 25, so no free daycare. I have flexibility with remote work but I can't care for a kid and do my job well.

If it matters, we're looking in North Shore.

Source: https://www.nasdaq.com/article/higher-home-prices-drive-pultes-q3-profit-beat-20181023-00427

Full disclosure I'm long this stock.  There's been some discussion over housing and home inventories and home builder stock have gotten absolutely nailed over the last few months over expectations that rising rates would sap demand.  There was finally some good news today with Pulte reporting better than expected earnings and stating that market conditions don't look like they're conductive to overbuilding.  New orders for Pulte only rose around 1% YoY but they also have around 2 full quarters worth of backlog and have seen improving margins with recent home price increases.  It seems supportive of the idea that for the most part home sales are more likely to flatten than collapse.  

Anecdotally though I have noticed some price cuts more recently in my area on existing homes.  I think part of that is people just asking too much given the financing environment and also sellers looking to close on a deal before winter hits in full force and buyers dry up.

One thing I am watching is sales data on higher end home builders.  That seems to be the segment under the greatest pressure right now with interest rates rising and price pressures in expensive urban environments.  West cost seems to be worse off than areas like Texas and Atlanta.  Again anecdotally higher end builders like NVR are still selling out communities in the D.C Metro area so the bite doesn't seem too bad on the east coast yet.

personalfinance,What should I do with the extra $400/month I’ll have after I pay off my car?,"So I am on track to pay off my car by December (yay) after aggressively paying it off over three years. In June I received a raise that allowed me to throw an extra $400/month at the car loan, so this amount was not previously in my budget. 

The way I see things I have four options for what to do with this money once the car is paid off. I’d like some advice on what the most fiscally responsible choice would be. 

1.	Put the money towards my $7,500 student loan balance. I currently pay the $150/month minimum with a 3.5% interest rate. I’m four years into the pay off period. 
2.	I recently rolled over a Roth 401k into my new employer’s 401k and put the other half into a Roth IRA. I am not currently contributing to the Roth IRA due to budget so maybe this is a good time to start contributing?
3.	Help my husband with his car or student loans. I don’t know the exact balances but he pays $250 per month for the car and $350 per month for the student loans. He is 3 years into the 5 year car loan and also 4 years into the student loans. While he drops windfalls into the balances (tax return, bonuses) he rarely if ever does more than the minimum payment. The car loan is 3.9% and he has student loans ranging from 3.5% to 4.5%. 
4.	Increase emergency fund. We currently combine our savings and emergency fund in one savings account with .35% interest. I was thinking of moving the emergency fund into a money market account and beefing it up a bit since right now we only have three months of expenses saved up. We have very loving and generous parents so I always figured we could rely on them in an emergency but we are getting to a point where it is probably a good idea to have our own back up plan in case of job less or medical emergency. 

Would also be interested in hearing if there are other things I’m not considering. Thanks for your advice.",finance

personalfinance,Need help navigating credit card debt and student loans. I’m clueless and confused.,"I am in absolute financial crisis mode right now. I don’t know anything about credit card debt or collectors and loans and stuff so I probably only need basic advice to get going in the right direction but I don’t even know how to gauge how screwed I am. I’ll try to give all relevant background information but it’s a lot so I’ll also put my main questions at the top if you don’t want to or need to read the background info. I’ve made terrible choices because I was severely misinformed about how credit cards and loans work. I’m researching and starting to understand the gravity of my mistakes but I’m still just a hot mess. If anyone can point me to good resources for info on this stuff too, I would really appreciate it.   Important background stuff: I haven’t been working for all of 2018, other than a little bit of Uber but it didn’t pan out, because of a car accident in February, but I am looking for a job I can do from home or that doesn’t require much standing and walking. I have no income other than food stamps and a generous soul is paying my rent and utilities right now so I won’t end up homeless and with bad rental history too. I owe my university $4500 from a previous semester and they just told me it will go to collections soon. I have to go back to school and finish my degree in about a year so I need to have that squared away by then. I have credit card debt and accounts are being closed and sent to collections because I haven’t been able to pay for a few months now since I burned through the little savings I had. My credit is horrendous because of this. Prior to all this, I had made payments on time every month and had good credit.  I don’t know how loans work and googling hasn’t gotten me far so I’m wondering if I can take out a student loan or personal loan to pay the school for a prior semester that I owe $4500 on and/or my CC debt? For a student loan, do they give money straight to the school or to me and do they track what you do with the money (can I use it to pay my CC debt?)? Can I use it to pay back for a prior semester or only current semester? My credit score is like 400 so I don’t know if I can even get approved or if it would just have a high interest rate or what. Can I get some other type of loan or something?  I’m trying to understand balance transfer cards. Can you get approved with terrible credit? Will they let me transfer it when I’m not in good standing (90+ days past due on most of my cards)? Can I transfer all of the debt to one? I have cards with Discover, AmEx, Credit One, Capital One, US bank, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America.  Some of my cards have closed and gone to collections. What do I need to know about how to work with these collections companies? Is there anything I can do to improve this situation?  I hear that credit consolidation companies can cause other problems because they ask you to stop paying on your cards and let them go to collections. Is this true? Is this a good  option? Is there another way to deal with this CC debt?  Are there any legit entry level jobs I can do from home (I scoured online job listings and most of the work-from-home ones were scams) or jobs that don’t require much standing or walking or lifting of any kind? My lower back was injured in a car accident and I’m still on the road to recovery. I can only handle standing and walking for an hour or two before the pain really kicks in. I found one with Rev doing transcription but it doesn’t pay much.  Okay, here’s more detailed background stuff in case it’s useful. I am one semester away from finishing my bachelors. I am in a special program at my university and I was able to get approved for a leave of absence for a year starting January 2018. They pay for a full ride for me, which means I get about $4500 from them every semester. I was still finishing some intercession classes in January because I had dropped some that I was failing in the fall (because I was having a mental health crisis, which is why they gave me a year off) and needed to make up the credits to stay in good academic standing with them. Because I was still finishing those classes, I was still on track in the program until I finished those classes in mid January and then they would unregister me for spring 2018 classes.  Because I was still registered, my scholarship from them for the spring still came through and they said when I unregistered for spring classes then I would just need to send the scholarship money back through my bursars account. Before all that was done, I was in a car accident in February that messed me up pretty bad. I haven’t been working other than doing Uber/Lyft for a few months before my car insurance found out I was doing ridesharing (I didn’t know you needed commercial insurance) and they dropped me. My parents pay for my car insurance and told me they don’t want me doing rideshare or they’ll stop paying for anything for me (honestly too messy of a relationship with them to explain this stuff), and my car is in the shop finally getting fixed now so I’m driving a hunk of junk and can’t do that anymore, even if I got commercial insurance. I’m doing doing PT twice a week, therapy once a week, seeing a psychiatrist periodically, and going to see a spine specialist and having procedures done periodically, and I can only stand and walk for about an hour before it starts to hurt like hell and most entry level jobs I can find in my area require being on your feet for 8 hours, and having an open schedule, which I definitely don’t with all these damn appointments. Anyway, I’m looking for work now but really struggling. Back to the scholarship. Because I was doing Uber and was hardly making anything because it’s just a tough market in my city (lots of drivers, not as many riders), I had the $4500 from school in my account and needed to pay rent and bills with basically no income so I was using the scholarship money to get by for a few months (I know, terrible decision but I really felt like I had no other choice because my parents have told me they will only pay for my car and phone, not help with my rent or anything and I would rather have debt than be homeless). I have the bursars bill just sitting and it’s racking up monthly fees. I have no income to pay it back and I just got a letter that it’s going to go to collections soon. I plan to call them and see if I can get on some kind of payment plan or something so it doesn’t go to collections but I won’t be able to make monthly payments anyway so... I don’t even know what to do about that. I have somewhere around $12,000 in credit card debt and haven’t been able to make payments for a few months now so two of my accounts have been closed and sent to collections just recently and the rest will soon too I’m sure. The CC companies have been calling me and I’ve been saying I have no income right now and they say okay well make a payment when you can or call us when you have income and want to set up a better payment plan. I have food stamps but other than that, my poor boyfriend, who has 2 kids to support (the biological mom is totally gone), has been paying my rent and utilities to keep a roof over my head, but there’s no way he can help me with this other debt. We’re barely scraping by.  I am wondering if I can take out a loan to pay the school bill so it doesn’t go to collections, and also because I need to have it taken care of by the time my leave of absence is over or I won’t be able to register that semester, which means I’ll lose the spot that is currently reserved for me in their medical school. I got another year approved because of the car accident so now I have until about November 2019 to get the school bill taken care of.",finance

My student loans had fallen into default a while back &amp; they had started garnishing my wages. I wasn't able to set up a payment plan, because they told me I had previously used that option, so the garnishments continued.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I got a letter in from the Dept of Edu, with the current balance of defaulted loan. I called the number and they said my account was being handled by Immediate Credit Recovery. I called their number, and they asked for the amount of $12,000. They asked me for some financial information, to set up a payment plan, but my lunch hour was just about up &amp; I had to run. I guess what's confusing me, is that I thought that loan defaulted into wage garnishment. Didn't realize they wanted me to set up a separate payment plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Figured I would see if anyone here had any information about the company or has experienced anything similar. If I set up a payment plan, would my wage garnishments stop? I don' t think I can make payments while my wages are being garnished. Any info you can provide is appreciated, thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Regarding my current wage garnishment, is that from the Federal Govt, or a collection agency? Whoever it is, they've been garnishing about $400 a month for a few years.

personalfinance,"Collection agency contacted me about 10 year old student loan, how should I proceed?","About a month ago I was contacted by a collection agency about an emergency student loan I took out exactly ten years ago. To be honest, I had forgotten I owed the university this money, because they never contacted me about it. A lot of things happened around that time that it just dropped off my radar.

I'm not sure if it's a Federal or Private loan, but it was an emergency loan through my school. Is there a way I can find out which it is?

Since it is 10 years old, if it were a private loan, wouldn't the statute of limitations have passed by now? This never appeared on any of my credit reports, so at this point, I'm not sure how to proceed so as to not reset the statutes of limitations in case that's a risk and could potentially harm my score as my wife and I are currently home-shopping.

I did write back immediately asking for proof, because at first I thought it was some sort of scam, but I received the proof that they acquired from the university where I attended and the classes I took ten years ago, and apparently I did end up owing them money.

I'm just at a loss as to how I should proceed. Being that this never appeared on my credit report, and it was ten years ago, should I even reply? I don't want to make things worse, but I also don't want to be a jerk and not pay for something I owe. Should I contact the university directly, or is that out of the question at this point? Should I be looking for legal advise instead?",finance

personalfinance,Seeking advice about where to invest my money once I am out of debt,"So, I have been a long time lurker of r/personalfinance but have yet to seek any advice, until now! Sorry in advance for the long post, just thought I’d give all the details so I can hear some new opinions. 

I am a single male in my mid-twenties. I currently live in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory (Canada) and work full-time for the government. I attended post secondary education and racked up about $60,000 in debt. I worked in the industry I went to school for but was unable to find a good paying job so I basically kept that $60,000 debt for about 5 years. Last year I switched careers and am now making a comfortable wage so I have been able to make significant progress on paying off my debt. 

Since January 2018, I have paid off $50,000 of debt. This leaves me with just $10,000 or so remaining. I should have it completely paid off by the end of this year. 

Now this is where I need some advice. Once my debt is paid off, I will start to have money that I can actually use for something and I don’t know what to do with it. 

1. I would like to buy some vacant land and build a cabin or tiny house but I’m not sure if this is smart. Vacant lots here sell for around $200,000 plus the cost of the structure/well/septic/solar so it can be quite expensive. This is my ultimate goal and ideal living situation, but end cost would be around $350,000 or so. Also, vacant lots require a significant down payment (20%-60%) so it would take a lot longer for me to save up for that. I don’t want to keep renting and paying somebody else’s mortgage while I’m saving for this. 

2. Another option is buying a 3 bedroom townhouse for around $350,000 and renting out two bedrooms. I should have no problem getting approved for a mortgage this size and as a first time home buyer, I only require 5% down payment. I know there is significant demand for rentals so I can easily rent each room out for $750/month. I feel like this option is the smart one, but I do shift-work and have to sleep during the day so having roommates is not ideal. I’m also rather particular so I feel as though I might regret my decision when I return home from work and the dish cloth is hanging off the oven with a crease in it (joking! I think it would be alright as long as I am selective with finding roommates). 

3. I can also buy a 2 bedroom mobile for around $120,000. I am leaning away from this option as it gets really cold here in the winter and mobiles are not known for being energy efficient, and they require a pad fee as you don’t own the land. I believe pad fees are around $450-600/month here. 

4. I am also considering saving up $10,000-$15,000 to invest, my family is saying this is the first thing I should do. I really know nothing about investments but my mom says I can just send $10,000 to her investor and he will increase it. He has a really good reputation and has done exceptionally well for a number of family/friends over the years. I don’t know any details about interest rates or his cost. Will I be penalized if I need the money at some point? Do you typically have to sign a contract with this type of thing? Not sure how I feel about this option. 

5. Safety fund - I’ve seen this mentioned on here plenty. Should I save up 6 months worth of expenses and just leave it in my checking account in case of emergency? I think my mom sees the investment (#4) as a safety fund.  

6. And finally, I am very tempted to reward myself with a toy. I’ve been working tons of overtime and being frugal all year, I haven’t really gone on vacation which I normally do for 1 month each year. So part of me says I deserve to buy myself a snowmobile or ATV. Cost would be approximately $10,000-$12,000 all in. I am very tempted to do this but I don’t think it’s a smart move at the moment. 

Please give me any advice on what would be the best move for me at this point or any other recommendations that I may have missed out on. Thanks!",finance

Would it make sense for me to take the $20000 loan (I have confirmed that the loan-to-value would work on this car) and make a lump sum payment on the principal with the $2300 cash back on my first payment? I don't know how to calculate how that would impact my total cost of my loan when it is all said and done.  I do understand that my monthly payment would be larger, but I am less concerned with that. Here are the terms.

$17700 loan for 66 mo. at 3.99%, $301/mo **or** $20000 loan for 66 mo. at 3.24%, $332/mo

ethereum,Announcing the U$D - Decentralizing USD Token Trust - Request for Comments,"Hello!

With Coinbase joining in on USDC, I figured this would be as good a time as ever to share a paper I have been drafting. USD tokens are becoming more and more numerous, and each of these have their own risks. It's time to create a decentralized, community governed USD token: The U$D (Universally SuppORted Dollar). I have put a link to the full Greenback Paper below, and the abstract below.

https://usd.foundation/

**Abstract**

The U$D is designed to act as an index of USD Tokens on the Ethereum network. The token is semi flexible, allowing ease of use without allowing any portion of the index to become overly dominant. A three-branch governing system, consisting of a true democracy, a stake-weighted democracy, and a council is also proposed to serve as a model of governance for the token, as well as decentralized digital governance more generally. The token will, in the medium to long run, also allow a shift away from the USD if indicated by the governance structure. The token will also allow for monetary policy independent of the US Fed, and enables the possibility of deflation in addition to inflation, should the governing structure take those actions.

**Comments/Feedback**

Building something like this will take comments and feedback from the community. I have built a good portion of the code according to the specification outlined in the above paper, but *we* need to collectively agree all the mechanisms as outlined accomplish all the features of a USD token in the short, medium, and long run that we all desire. As such, I am releasing the paper with the hope of getting critical comments in order to iterate and improve on the design of the token, and the subsequent code iterating upon the design as described in the paper. I have set aside time this weekend to (hopefully) finish the code, taking into account community feedback. I intend to release an updated draft of the Greenback paper (taking feedback into account) and the corresponding code on Monday.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Student loan provider did not send us a bill for 5 months, now they are refusing to remove the delinquent bill from credit report","My wife graduated in December of 2016, after which her loans were on a 6 month deferment before repayment started. Around mid-fall, we realized that we had not received any bills or information from the loan provider. No calls, emails, letters, nothing. All of our contact info was the same as when she graduated, we hadn't moved or changed phone numbers. She tried to log into her student email account which was the one we used to sign up, but she couldn't access it anymore. We couldn't even remember who our loan provider was. I remembered that some of my loans were on a 9 month deferral, so I figured it was something like that. 

Around December, we get an angry letter saying we were about to enter default. I was floored, this was the first communication we had received from them at all! We called their number, and talked to a guy who was really friendly and said that if we just got caught up it would all be fine and wouldn't affect our credit or anything. I was a little annoyed about all the accumulated interest, but there were no late fees so I figured it was all fine. 

Fast forward to this month, we finally are moving forward with buying a house and so we go talk to a mortgage broker and they pull our credit and it had taken a huge dive! The last report we got was in late 2017 (also from a mortgage lender) and it was 820 for me and around 600 for my wife. Now, it was 740 for me and 405(!) for her. The only negative hit on her account was 90+ day delinquency on those loans. She doesn't have a credit card, and her car was paid off a few years ago so the loan is the only line of credit she currently has. 

We called the loan provider, and they have been totally unwilling to work with us on this. They told us before if we got current it wouldn't go on our credit and now they are just like ""sorry, whoever told you that was wrong"". They also said they sent us paper bills (untrue) and called and left numerous voicemails (also untrue). We demanded that they send us a full record of contact attempts by them and I am going to check them against our phone records. There is no way they called and left voicemails, we often don't answer unknown numbers, but we always check voicemails. They said they would send this in 3-4 business days, but it's been well over a week now.  

At this point, I don't know what to do. Her low credit score is preventing us from getting the loan type we want, and putting us into a higher interest rate. We have to move out of our current place at the end of this year, so we need to get this taken care of asap. 

Is this the kind of thing that you can file a complaint/correction with the credit reporting agencies? How would I go about about proving anything? Are we just screwed?

TLDR loan provider didn't send us a bill, now they won't take the lates off our credit report and it's making it much harder to buy a house.",finance
personalfinance,How do I know if I should refinance my house?,"Purchased in December 2010 for $185,000. I bought the house with my mother so the deed and mortgage are in both our names. She bought her own house and moved out a few months ago. I’ve been married for four years and would like everything to be in my and my husbands name now that my mother moved out.

I don’t entirely understand what refinancing is. Is it basically taking out a new loan with better terms based on the current equity and loan balance? How would I go about doing it? What are the risks/benefits? What do I need to know or do to prepare to refinance?

Here are the stats:

Down payment was $40,000 (gift entirely from my father)

Original loan $145,000

Interest rate 5%

Current balance $124,900

Monthly payment minimum $778 (I usually pay $20-50 extra each month). This is comfortably within our budget

Current income is about $65-70,000. My husband is a student so I have the only income

My credit score on credit karma is 770

The house is probably worth about $250-275,000 based on similar houses I’ve seen on the market

Other debt is about $14,000 in student loans between my husband and I

Thanks for your help

Edit-

I realized there are really two steps here. One is getting the house/deed in my and my husbands name. Two is possibly refinancing. Since this is a PF subreddit, I will stick to addressing the second one.",finance
personalfinance,To buy or not to buy a house in NorCal,"Hello finance gurus of reddit!

My husband (26) and I (23) are trying to make a decision on whether we should be jumping into home-ownership. We both really want a place of our own to settle into (2.5 kids, white picket fence, yard with a dog, blah blah blah). We have a few factors we're trying to balance and I don't think either of us really have the knowledge to make an informed decision. Things we know: 1) interest rates are going up and could continue that climb for a bit, 2) houses in the area we currently live and want to stay in are also on the rise because it's developing and it's a really nice place to live (#10 best place to raise a family in CA).

So you all probably want to see some numbers to weigh in on this. We currently have $33k in our savings account. We figure this is enough to put 5% down on a $400k house (this is below the median house price in our city but gets us a decently updated 3bd/2bth home). Our only debts are my student loans ($11,694/$130 a month) and our car loan ($13,095/$250 a month). Both of these loans are less than 5% interest. Our take home pay currently is \~$6k but I just got a 11% raise so this should go up but it hasn't gone through HR yet so I haven't seen what my new take home will be. Also to add, my husband just got his MBA in May and his expected salary should be in the $70-90k range after he moves on from this job after the new year. We aren't factoring that increase in salary into our house price because we know that isn't a guarantee. 

Current expenses:

Rent - $1023

Groceries - $200-$300 (depending on where I shop)

 Cars (payment + insurance + gas) - $461

Utilities (only pay electric and Internet as LL pays water) - \~$200

Cellphone - $23

Eating out (fast food and dine in) - our budget is $100 but it can be more or less depending on how social we're feeling

Tithe for church - 10% of what we earn so about $600 a month if we remember

Gym - $20

Misc. - maybe $300 on a month we're not paying attention? we honestly try not to spend money and we are both big time savers

After all is said and done, we can usually put away $2500 each month into our savings account to go towards a down payment on a house. We both already contribute to retirement through our employers but we don't have IRA's. I was thinking we should open one and then we started talking about house buying so we figured we should wait because of the credit hit we would take.

Lastly, we signed our lease until July (didn't think we would be in the house market until then) but know there are ways to get out of it or we can sublet with LL permission. 

Sorry this is so long but we're trying to figure out if we can out-save the mortgage rates and housing prices rising with these numbers. TIA to anyone who can give  us some insight.",finance

investing,WSJ: Trump Steps Up Attacks on Fed Chair Powell,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-steps-up-attacks-on-fed-chairman-jerome-powell-1540338090

Automod told me to comment on this as it relates to the market so here:

Trump is commenting on monetary policy which has traditionally been something POTUS doesn't do, but nothing about 2018 is tradition so there's that. The key questions this raises are A) if Trump decides Tuesday shouldn't be a day anymore, can he fire Fed chair, and B) will any of Trump's comments effect Powell or the Fed as a whole? I have no idea about either and I don't even want to guess at A, but B is interesting because if the Fed is effected in any way, they can either A) double down on rate hikes as a show of independence from the White House, or B) actually slow down the hikes so as to not be blamed by Republicans when the economy inevitably goes down the drain. 

My guess is that Powell won't comment on this and whether or not it will change how he decides to proceed isn't something we'll know because we don't know what he would have done in the absence of these comments. I *really* don't think they're going to slow down substantially on the hikes with inflation indicators finally reflecting what a lot of consumer staples conference calls have been saying for a while.",finance

gaming,Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4 Review,"The latest in the popular Call of Duty series has arrived with Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII. The game has made the controversial decision to forgo the traditional campaign in favor of a Battle Royale mode known as Blackout and a more expansive online experience which includes more Zombie modes and a greater emphasis on gameplay.

I played the game first at E3 and then again during the Beta phases for the game so I had a decent familiarity with what to expect when the full release version of the game arrived.

After several days of playing the game, I have to say it is to me a mixed bag and many aspects of it disappointed me which is very frustrating as fan of the series since the very first game.

The look and feel of the game does not come across to me as a new game but instead to me look and play like DLC for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. Many of the maps seem familiar and have been updated from their appearances in previous games. The same holds true for the weapons and kill streaks. I am not saying it is not fun, but it all has a sense of having seen most of it before.

Another very annoying change to the game is the severe limitation of grenades in the game. Usually a player has a grenade option which comes in handy when Snipers setup behind cover. Without the ability to lob a grenade to get Snipers out from cover, players are easy pickings, especially when the first appear on the screen. You can unload a full clip into a player at a distance and still end up dead with one shot from a sniper. As such you have to wait until you reach level 42 in order to add them to your customized loadout and even then they are very Nerfed from what players have come to expect.

The multiplayer modes are what you have come to expect as there are the Team Deathmatch variations as well as the Capture and Control modes and a new mode called Heist where players need to capture or prevent the capture of a target.

For me the most enjoyable aspect of the game was the Zombie modes as not only were the players I was matched with usually very helpful, but they were also much friendlier than many of the other people I encountered.

The Blackout mode is very popular with gamers but not being a fan of the One and Done mode of play, I found myself enjoying the vast details of the map and preferring to work with a team, capturing vehicles, and such. I have seen multiple players unload point blank on a player in this mode only to see them walk away and one shot kill their attackers. This is either a hack or an example of how imbalanced things can be at times and you will see multiple instances of players taking numerous hits and walking away while others go down with one shot.

Black Ops IIII does not have a regenerative health system and instead requires players to use a timed injection in order to restore health.

This is all designed to foster teamwork and to make the game more appealing to the eSports community. While this is nice, it deviates from much of what has made the game so appealing from the start.

The game to me seems like it was hurried to market as it released on October 12th vs the traditional November release date. I am sure a big part of this was a desire to beat Red Dead Redemption 2 to market but in doing so it seems that things are missing from the final product.

There is much to like about the game as it is still an exciting and intense experience but to me is the first Call of Duty game to not feel shiny and new but instead more of the same in many cases.

The developers have supported the game with numerous updates and there are more on the way as well as planned DLC down the road so the game as it is now is likely to change in the next few months as more feedback is given to developers and new features are added.

Hopefully they will also look to add a campaign at a later date as although it is fun, it seems lacking and dated in many aspects as the changes seem like a step back to me rather than progress.

personalfinance,21 year old student w/ a job. Unsure of how to spend / save money! Seeking advice,"Hi, 21 yr old college student here. I have always had a hard time managing money and saving, I recently was able to save up for a car earlier this year and bought an old Honda for $1,500. I've had it for 6 months and it's been great. I've been teaching myself how to work on it and I've saved a lot of money from the various work I've had to do already. It takes me to work 4 days a week and gets decent gas mileage. Commuting to work has finally started to tire me (50 miles total there and back) and my company is moving offices a little bit further away at the start of next year.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to decide if I should move closer to work and possibly sell my car so I have less expenses (drop insurance, no spending on gas / auto parts). I spend $40 on gas a week and $150 on insurance each month. I moved back in with my mom at the start of this year and have been helping her out by giving her $150 a month. With all my other expenses I pay about $800 a month on food/rent/insurance/credit cards/phone.  I make around $1500 - $1800 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

My Debt:

$5,000 on my school loans with 4-5% interest (Still in school, so I haven't started paying them)

Should I be putting money towards them while interest isn't building the loan amount?

$650 on one credit card, high interest rate I think 19% (I was 18 when I got this, my bank doesn't even offer this type of credit card anymore lol). I have 3 cards total but the rest are paid off. I have pretty decent credit at 700\~

&amp;#x200B;

Savings:

Under $1,000.

I just took a vacation by myself because I needed to for my own mental health and since I bought a car earlier this year that took up a decent amount of my savings, I have a pretty reliable car now after throwing some money at parts. I only made half of what I make now at the start of the year but I've had my current job for 5 months. I know I need to save more money and I'm wondering if I should open some sort of retirement fund since my job doesn't offer a Roth IRA or 401K.

&amp;#x200B;

Investing (Not as important but I am still interested):

I used to do some light stock trading when I was 18 and really enjoyed investing. Now that I am older and have a bit more money I was considering investing a little bit each paycheck. But since I make so little money I have a feeling that I should only be focusing on saving right now until I finish school and get a better paying job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

I'm not sure if I should move closer to work, I live in the middle of no where and would have to move in to Portland or the suburbs. Rent is pretty high and I could maybe find a studio for $900 a month but I know I would have to find roommates instead and pay something like $400 - $600 for a room. Moving out and selling my car will let me allocate more of my income towards rent. I have approximately 4 months until my job gets further away so I know I should start saving more aggressively if I am thinking of moving out, but I'm unsure what the best way to do this will be. Any advice would be very appreciated! Thank you /r/personalfinance.",finance

Should we pay down principal first to elimitate PMI and then cash flow home improvements?

Should I just forget about the PMI because it's only $130?

4. ""I like to call this the easy money trap: anything used as a store of value will have its supply increased, and anything whose supply can be easily increased will destroy the wealth of those who used it as a store of value""
5. ""For something to assume a monetary role, it has to be costly to produce, otherwise the temptation to make money on the cheap will destroy the wealth of the savers, and destroy the incentive anyone has to save in this medium""

12. ""World War I saw the end of the era of monetary media being the choice decided by the free market, and the beginning of the era of government money""
13. ""Government money is similar to primitive forms of money and commodities other than gold: it is liable to having its supply increased quickly compared to its stock, leading to a quick loss of salability, destruction of purchasing power, and impoverishment of its holders""
14. ""With the simple suspension of gold redeemability, governments’ war efforts were no longer limited to the money that they had in their own treasuries, but extended virtually to the entire wealth of the population""

19. ""Hyperinflation is a form of economic disaster unique to government money. There was never an example of hyperinflation with economies that operated a gold or silver standard""
20. ""With government money, whose cost of production tends to zero, it has become quite possible for an entire society to witness all of its savings in the form of money disappear in the space of a few months or even weeks""
21. ""Hyperinflation is a far more pernicious phenomenon than just the loss of a lot of economic value by a lot of people; it constitutes a complete breakdown of the structure of economic production of a society built up over centuries and millennia""
22. ""Even if the textbooks were correct about the benefits of government management of the money supply, the damage from one episode of hyperinflation anywhere in the world far outweighs them""

currency, expropriating the wealth of the holders to benefit those who print  
the currency, and those who receive it earliest. This is termed the Cantillon  
Effect”
25. “Whether it’s because of downright graft, “national emergency,” or an infestation of inflationist schools of economics, government will always find a reason and a way to print more money, expanding government power while reducing the wealth of the currency holders”
26. “It is ironic, and very telling, that in the era of government money, governments themselves own far more gold in their official reserves than they did under the international gold standard of 1871–1914”
27. “A sound money makes service valuable to others the only avenue open for prosperity to anyone, thus concentrating society’s efforts on production, cooperation, capital accumulation, and trade”
28. “The twentieth century was the century of unsound money and the omnipotent state, as a market choice in money was denied by government diktat, and government-issued paper money was forced on people with the threat of violence”

30. “Sound money is a prime factor in determining individual time preference, an enormously important and widely neglected aspect of individual decision making. Time preference refers to the ratio at which individuals value the  
present compared to the future”

34. “The move from money that holds its value or appreciates to money that loses its value is very significant in the long run: society saves less, accumulates less capital, and possibly begins to consume its capital”
35. “Civilizations prosper under a sound monetary system, but disintegrate when their monetary systems are debased, as was the case with the Romans, the Byzantines, and modern European societies”
36. “What matters in money is its purchasing power, not its quantity, and as such, any quantity of money is enough to fulfil the monetary functions, as long as it is divisible and groupable enough to satisfy holders’ transaction and storage needs”
37. “The best form of money in history was the one that would cause the new supply of money to be the least significant compared to the existing stockpiles, and thus make its creation not a good source of profit”
38. “Had government money been a superior unit of account and store of value, it would not need government legal tender laws to enforce it, nor would governments worldwide have had to confiscate large quantities of gold and continue to hold them in their central bank reserves”
39. “The fact that central banks continue to hold onto their gold, and have even started increasing their reserves, testifies to the confidence they have in their own currencies in the long term”
40. “Sound money is money that gains in value slightly over time, meaning that holding onto it is likely to offer an increase in purchasing power”
41. “Unsound money, being controlled by central banks whose express mission is to keep inflation positive, will offer little incentive for holders to keep it”
42. “With unsound money, only returns that are higher than the rate of depreciation of the currency will be positive in real terms, creating incentives for high-return but high-risk investment and spending”

46. “The twentieth century’s binge on conspicuous consumption cannot be understood separately from the destruction of sound money and the outbreak of Keynesian high-time-preference thinking, in vilifying savings and deifying consumption as the key to economic prosperity”
47. “It is an ironic sign of the depth of modern-day economic ignorance fomented by Keynesian economics that capitalism - an economic system based on capital accumulation from saving - is blamed for unleashing conspicuous consumption - the  
exact opposite of capital accumulation”
48. “Capitalism is what happens when people drop their time preference, defer immediate gratification, and invest in the future. Debt-fueled mass consumption is as much a normal part of capitalism as asphyxiation is a normal part of respiration”
49. “The only cause of economic growth in the first place is delayed gratification, saving, and investment, which extend the length of the production cycle and increase the productivity of the methods of production, leading to better standards of living”
50. “This move from sound money to depreciating money has led to several generations of accumulated wealth being squandered on conspicuous consumption within a generation or two, making indebtedness the new method for funding major expenses”
51. “As H. L. Mencken put it: “Every election is an advanced auction on stolen goods””

54. “In times of sound money and low time preference, artists worked on perfecting their craft so they could produce valuable works in the long run”  
56.“Modern artists have replaced craft and long hours of practice with pretentiousness, shock value, indignation, and existential angst as ways to cow audiences into appreciating their art, and often added some pretense to political ideals, usually of the puerile Marxist variety”

64. “The business cycle is the natural result of the manipulation of the interest rate distorting the market for capital by making investors imagine they can attain more capital than is available with the unsound money they have been given by the banks”
65. “Contrary to Keynesian animist mythology, business cycles are not mystic phenomena caused by flagging “animal spirits” whose cause is to be ignored as central bankers seek to try to engineer recovery”
66. “Economic logic clearly shows how recessions are the inevitable outcome of interest rate manipulation in the same way shortages are the inevitable outcome of price ceilings”
67. “Monetary history testifies to how much more severe business cycles and recessions are when the money supply is manipulated than when it isn’t”
68. “A capitalist system cannot function without a free market in capital, where the price of capital emerges through the interaction of supply and demand and the decisions of capitalists are driven by accurate price signals”
69. “The central bank’s meddling in the capital market is the root of all recessions and all the crises which most politicians, journalists, academics, and leftist activists like to blame on capitalism”
70. “Imagining that central banks can “prevent,” “combat,” or “manage” recessions is as fanciful and misguided as placing pyromaniacs and arsonists in charge of the fire brigade”
71. “Central planning of credit markets must fail because it destroys markets’ mechanisms for price-discovery providing market participants with the accurate signals and incentives to manage their consumption and production”
72. “It is typical of the [#MiltonFriedman](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/miltonfriedman?source=feed_text) band of libertarianism in that it blames the government for an economic problem, but the flawed reasoning leads to suggesting even more government intervention as the solution”
73. “Only when a central bank manipulates the money supply and interest rate does it become possible for large-scale failures across entire sectors of the economy to happen at the same time, causing waves of mass layoffs in entire industries”
74. “In a free market for money, individuals would choose the currencies they want to use, and the result would be that they would choose the currency with the reliably lowest stock-to-flow ratio. This currency would oscillate the least with changes in demand and supply”
75. “It is an astonishing fact of modern life that an entrepreneur in the year 1900 could make global economic plans and calculations all denominated in any international currency, with no thought whatsoever given to exchange rate fluctuations”
76. “The combination of floating exchange rates and Keynesian ideology has given our world the entirely modern phenomenon of currency wars”
77. “Hard money, by taking the question of supply out of the hands of governments and their economist-propagandists, would force everyone to be productive to society instead of seeking to get rich through the fool’s errand of monetary manipulation”
78. “Under a sound monetary system, government had to function in a way that is unimaginable to generations reared on the twentieth-century news cycle: they had to be fiscally responsible”
79. “For those of us alive today, raised on the propaganda of the omnipotent governments of the twentieth century, it is often hard to imagine a world in which individual freedom and responsibility supersede government authority”  
82“. The fundamental scam of modernity is the idea that government needs to manage the money supply. It is an unquestioned starting assumption of all mainstream economic schools of thought and political parties”
80. “Having the ability to print money, literally and figuratively, increases the power of any government, and any government looks for anything that gives it more power”
81. “By placing a hard cap on the total supply of bitcoins, Nakamoto was clearly unpersuaded by the arguments of the standard macroeconomics textbook and more influenced by the Austrian school, which argues that the quantity of money itself is irrelevant”
82. “Societies with money of stable value generally develop a low time preference, learning to save and think of the future, while societies with high inflation and depreciating economies will develop high time preference as people lose track of the importance of saving”
83. “With sound money, the government’s war effort was limited by the taxes it could collect. With unsound money, it is restrained by how much money it can create before the currency is destroyed, making it able to appropriate wealth far more easily”
84. “Unsound money is a particularly dangerous tool in the hands of modern democratic governments facing constant reelection pressure. Modern voters are unlikely to favor the candidates who are upfront about the costs and benefits of their schemes”
85. “Unsound money is at the heart of the modern delusion believed by most voters and those unfortunate enough to study modern macroeconomics at university level: that government actions have no opportunity costs”
86. “It is no coincidence that when recounting the most horrific tyrants of history, one finds that every single one of them operated a system of government-issued money which was constantly inflated to finance government operation”
87. “Unsound money makes government power potentially unlimited, with large consequences to every individual, forcing politics to the center stage of their life and redirecting much of society’s energy and resources to the zero-sum game of who gets to rule and how”
88. “In the world of fiat money, having access to the central bank’s monetary spigots is more important than serving customers. Firms that can get low-interest-rate credit to operate will have a persistent advantage over competitors that cannot”
89. “Banking has evolved into a business that generates returns without risks to bankers and simultaneously creates risks without returns for everyone else”
90. “In a world where central banks allocate credit, the larger firm has an advantage in being able to secure funding at a low rate which its smaller competitors cannot get”
91. “Bitcoin was the first engineering solution that allowed for digital payments without having to rely on a trusted third-party intermediary. By being the first  
digital object that is verifiably scarce, Bitcoin is the first example of digital cash”
92. “Whereas in a modern central bank the new money created goes to finance lending and government spending, in Bitcoin the new money goes only to those who spend resources on updating the ledger”
93. “Difficulty adjustment is the most reliable technology for making hard money and limiting the stock-to-flow ratio from rising, and it makes Bitcoin fundamentally different from every other money”
94. “Bitcoin is the hardest money ever invented: growth in its value cannot possibly increase its supply; it can only make the network more secure and immune to attack”
95. “The security of Bitcoin lies in the asymmetry between the cost of solving the proof-of-work necessary to commit a transaction to the ledger and the cost of verifying its validity”
96. “The Bitcoin ledger of transactions might just be the only objective set of facts in the world”
97. “Bitcoin is the first example of a digital good whose transfer stops it from being owned by the sender”
98. “Bitcoin presents a tremendous technological leap forward in the monetary solution to the indirect exchange problem, perhaps as significant as the move from cattle and salt to gold and silver”
99. “Without a conservative monetary policy and difficulty adjustment, Bitcoin would only have succeeded theoretically as digital cash, but remained too insecure to be used widely in practice”
100. “Bitcoin’s volatility derives from the fact that its supply is utterly inflexible and not responsive to demand changes, because it is programmed to grow at a predetermined rate”
101. “As the size of the market grows, along with the sophistication and the depth of the financial institutions dealing with Bitcoin, this volatility will likely decline”
102. “As long as Bitcoin is growing, its token price will behave like that of a stock of a start-up achieving very fast growth. Should Bitcoin’s growth stop and stabilize, it would stop attracting high-risk investment flows, and become just a normal monetary asset”
103. “Bitcoin is the cheapest way to buy the future, because Bitcoin is the only medium guaranteed to not be debased, no matter how much its value rises”
104. “The strict digital scarcity of the Bitcoin tokens combines the best elements of physical monetary media, without any of the physical drawbacks to moving and transporting it. Bitcoin might have a claim to make for being the best technology for saving ever invented”
105. “Any person who owns Bitcoin achieves a degree of economic freedom which was not possible before its invention”
106. “For the first time since the emergence of the modern state, individuals have a clear technical solution to escaping the financial clout of the governments they live under”
107. “Bitcoin, and cryptography in general, are defensive technologies that make the cost of defending property and information far lower than the cost of attacking them”
108. “If BTC continues to grow to capture a larger share of the global wealth, it may force governments to become more and more a form of voluntary organization, which can only acquire its “taxes” voluntarily by offering its subjects services they would be willing to pay for”
109. “Contrary to popular depictions of anarchists as hoodie-clad hoodlums, Bitcoin’s brand of anarchism is completely peaceful, providing individuals with the tools necessary for them to be free from government control and inflation”
110. “The invention of Bitcoin has created, from the ground up, a new independent alternative mechanism for international settlement that does not rely on any intermediary and can operate entirely separate from the existing financial infrastructure”
111. “Bitcoin can be seen as the new emerging reserve currency for online transactions, where the online equivalent of banks will issue Bitcoin-backed tokens to users while keeping their hoard of Bitcoins in cold storage”
112. “Bitcoin’s advantage is that by bringing the finality of cash settlement to the digital world, it has created the fastest method for final settlement of large payments across long distances and national borders”
113. “Bitcoin can be best understood to compete with settlement payments between central banks and large financial institutions, and it compares favorably to them due to its verifiable record, cryptographic security, and imperviousness to third-party security holes”
114. “BTC, having no counterparty risk and no reliance on any third-party, is uniquely suited to play the same role that gold played in the gold standard""
115. “If Bitcoin continues to grow in value and gets utilized by a growing number of financial institutions, it will become a reserve currency for a new form of central bank""
116. “The first central bank to buy BTC will alert the rest of the central banks to the possibility and make many of them rush toward it. The first central bank purchase is likely to make the value of BTC rise significantly""

122. “After years of watching altcoins get created, it seems impossible that any coin will recreate the adversarial standoff that exists between Bitcoin stakeholders and prevents any party from controlling payments in it”
123. “It is high time for everyone involved in BTC to stop concerning themselves with the question of the identity of Nakamoto, and accept that it does not matter to the operation of the technology, in the same way that the identity of the inventor of the wheel no longer matters”
124. “No single altcoin has demonstrated anything near Bitcoin’s impressive resilience to change, which is down to its truly decentralized nature and the strong incentives for everyone to abide by the status quo consensus rules”

My new job is through a staffing agency until the contract converts over to full time, I do not have a 401k option through the staffing agency, and I can not keep the money in my employers 401k. I have about 40k in debt between my student loans, car loan, and credit cards. I know there is a 10 percent penalty to cash out the 401k, plus state and federal taxes, but given the case that it is below the threshold to leave in my current employers account until my contract converts, does it make more sense to convert this over to an IRA, or take the penalty, cash it out, and put the money towards my  debt?  I am not actively looking to save for a house, as I want to move out of my current state first, and given my family's genetic history, there is a very low chance I will actually make it to retirement age.

This is my first post. Thanks to those who decide to give a few minutes of their time. 

In January, I (26M) will be heading to Carpentry school (Quebec, Canada )after strongly debating it for a few years. I grew so fed up of my management degree and I decided it was time for a change before it was too late. Only thing that has me worried is going back to school after a long period off, and going back to the college lifestyle after living so freely for the last few years. Going back to the minimum wage job while i go to school and sticking to a tight budget in particular are putting me through some decent levels of stress.  

I guess my general question is does anyone here have any general tips that could help with the transition back to this college lifestyle without falling back in the negative patterns that also come with the college lifestyle? Or general bits of informations that could be helpful that I just havent thought of.

I have already sold and downgraded my car to get rid of car payments, put college student loans on hold with the provincial government, and got a roommate and am paying for a room instead of a full apartment.

personalfinance,$185k/yr income in a state with normal housing costs at 25 with $0 debt + no children,"Edit: just realized with 401k matching it's closer to $190k/yr

My rent is about $1,600/mo for an apartment and I have no state income tax (Florida).

1. Should I contribute to Roth 401k or pre-tax 401k? I do not like having to pay $39k/yr in federal taxes because I'm single + don't own a house, but I understand how I'll probably have millions of dollars invested by retirement due to compound interest from shoveling away $18.5k a year+ for at least the next 5-10 years and it's smarter to pay the comparatively little taxes upfront now.

2. How high of a priority should getting a house be? I did some math and I don't think it'd be a huge savings for me in South Florida versus renting due to astronomical homeowner's insurance (something like $5k/yr due to hurricanes for a $400k house), relatively high property taxes, and $200-$400/mo HOA fees. I'd personally prefer to rent my entire life and invest. Plus the real estate market is near all time highs again from what I can deduct from Zillow + Trulia.

3. After maxing out the annual $18.5k/yr 401k limit, where else should I be investing? I am in too high of a bracket to receive any benefit from an IRA. Should I set up a regular brokerage account and contribute weekly into some aggressive ETFs through betterment? 

4. How much is too much savings? If I rent a modest apartment, lease a more than good enough new car, and dine + eat out relatively well, I still have well over $5k/mo left over. I know this subreddit would never endorse it... but.. if I'm 25 maxing out my 401k plus some... does it ever make sense to have something really nice like a car or a boat or something? I'm at a personal moral dilemma trying to find the answer to that.",finance
personalfinance,Girlfriend (22) works in a group home and is looking for a career change. What are our options?,"I'm using a throwaway because I don't want this linked to my regular account.

My girlfriend (22) has worked overnights at the local ARC group home for almost a year now. From what I hear, the house is understaffed and the management are exploitative of their employees. I worry for her health as she continues working here. While she is scheduled as a 35 hour/week employee, she generally works 12 or 14 hour long shifts, and leaving early is abandonment and a criminal offense. Both of us want her to find a new line of work.

She makes about $15/hour in New York, and just signed a lease at $650/month. She has a high school diploma, and her resume has several years of retail followed by this position.

I'm finishing college as an engineer, and haven't worked retail since I was in high school, so I'm very out of practice on how to look for jobs outside of my field.

What are our options for finding her a new line of work? What kind of work is she qualified for? What are some tools we can use for a career change?

personalfinance,"Family member has asked me to loan him money to pay off a credit card, what should I do?","Background: I'm a student currently getting money from scholarships until 2020. Hopefully I'll get a job in 2020 but the money stops flowing in around then. I have managed to save up $30k and was talking to a family member, getting advice on what I could do with it to make the most out of my money. This was partly prompted by the fact that he just bought a house and thought it would be a good investment option for me too. Also, we all live in NZ if that makes a difference. 

This family member's wife has $12k in a credit card loan at 19% interest and has proposed that I pay that off and he will pay me back at a lower interest (5%) at roughly $100 a week.

That interest rate is currently higher than what I'm currently getting in the bank. 

This family member has been very good to me, given me a place to stay for long periods of time, many dinners, etc, and is a bit of a father figure to me. I trust him, but I wouldnt call him or his wife good with money. I regret bringing up money with him haha but I do want to help him out. 

What advice can you give me, r/personalfinance?

Edit: thanks for all the advice, long time lurker so I knew how it was probably going to go but wanted to get a second opinion anyway. I messaged my family member and basically said that I wasn't comfortable loaning that amount of money for such a long time, especially with my life being up in the air in just over a year.

personalfinance,"About to graduate with 40,000 in debt making 50k a year. Can you guys help me game plan for 2019?","So I'm currently entering my last semester at school and will graduate in the winter. I accepted an offer at a company for 25 an hour starting part time now, transitioning to full time once I graduate. 

So currently my debts are as follows

Credit Card: $4,000

Federal Student Loans: $28,000

Private Student Loan: $7,000

If everything goes well, I'll be making $50,000 a year starting in December, which actually could get bumped up to $60,000 potentially. 

My net pay according to where I live will just be slightly under $40,000 a year, and I have a high paying side job ($50pr/hr) so my monthly break down is as follows

Full time: $3,333

Side Gig: $1,200-2,000 (pre-tax)

So a good average month would be about $4,000


I currently don't own a car, but I need to get one, and my credit is shit due to my credit balance being maxed out. I don't know the exact numbers on my expenses, but how should I orient myself to figure out what I can afford vs what I want? 

Obviously, I'm gonna want to ""splurge"" since I've been so fucking broke for the past 4 years, but I don't know how to be fair to myself while ridding myself of my debts?

I also don't currently pay rent but do want to move out of my living situation. So my monthly living expenses are basically around $500 for food, ubers and such. 

How should I track my budgeting to prepare for working full time in order to pay off as much debt as possible?",finance

personalfinance,Contemplating Diverting Retirement Savings To Student Loans,"So a little background.... I left law school with approximately $240K in student loans.  I've been able to pay that down to about $150K.  Each year I've maximized my tax-advantaged retirement savings ($18K to 401k (no match), $6Kx2 to Roth IRA for wife and me, $6,750 to HSA, $500/month for kid's 529), and since graduating I've also managed to save up a 6 month emergency fund of $50K in a Marcus savings account (that I don't consider available to myself).  

I'm getting to the point at my law firm where I'm considering whether being a big firm lawyer long term is for me or not—after 6 years of practice I know the stress and 60-70 hr weeks have taken their toll on my physical and mental health.  However, the thing that makes me feel trapped there is the student loans.  My current payment on my SoFi refinance loan is $3,218/month (3.25% interest rate), and making minimum monthly payments will have me paid off in a bit over 4 years from now.  My concern is that while that payment is fairly easy for me to make at my current comp level, it would be hard to keep up with that outside of a firm job.

I'm considering diverting some future savings to pay off the student loans quicker.  I anticipate my annual bonus to be in the $70K range (which is where I typically deduct the above mentioned savings from).  Instead of using that for retirement savings/HSA/etc., I'm considering directing the entire after-tax amount (about $45K I imagine) to my student loans for just this year.  In addition, I think I can increase my monthly payment to about $5,500/month without major lifestyle modifications and maybe even $600 if I'm more careful with going out and frivolous purchases.  Following this strategy, it seems like I can have my balance under $50K by this time next year.

I guess my question is this a smart play? I'm not sure if I want leave big firm life yet, but with the student loans I don't feel like I have any option but to stay at this point.  I've been diligent to this point about saving, but my sense is to just do what I can to get rid of the student loans sooner will just be better for my and and families health.",finance

personalfinance,Any reason not to recast my home mortgage?,"I have a mortgage on my home with a principal balance of approximately $300,000 at an interest rate of 4.1%. As part of a signing bonus for a new job, I received a $50,000 lump sum that could only be used towards the principal on my mortgage. After making the payment, my mortgage lender offered a no-fee recast.

My current monthly mortgage payment is approximately $1800. After the recast, it will drop to $1500.

My plan is to continue making a monthly mortgage payment of $1800, but figure that recasting my mortgage will give me greater flexibility for the remainder of the mortgage.

Is this thinking logical, or is there a downside to this that I don't see?",finance

I am also aware that interest rates are rising, so that plays a factor as well.  Any advise is welcome.

personalfinance,"Hi Reddit! 24, new job and raise, $43k in loans - help me plan!","Hi Reddit, as the title says I recently landed a new job (started beginning of October) which increased my annual income from ~$40k to a $60k salary. I'm going to have a bit of money leftover each month and I'm not sure what the best approach is. My expenses per month are about $2000 and I estimate I'll be taking home around $3500 after taxes and 403(b) contribution (6% of salary, match capped at 6%).


I've got about $16,500 in a car loan at 3.49% (yes, probably too much car). Roughly $26k in student loans all at 3.610% or 4.040%, with the exception of one at 6.550% ($5,600). Savings of $2,600 (WF savings account, planning to move to Discover for 1.8% interest) and a 401k of $4,200 that I am rolling into a Vanguard traditional IRA. Two CC that I pay off in full each month.




What is the best approach for me to wipe my loans while putting away money for emergencies, retirement, and potentially a house?


 My main goal right now is to take out the student loan at 6.55% ASAP. I would also like to open and max a Roth IRA which I was thinking could be used as a buffer for emergency fund/potential house fund. Maxing the IRA would be about $460 a month, leaving me roughly $1000 leftover. Should I use this to kill that one student loan as fast as possible, build up my actual emergency fund, or start a house fund? Should I be very concerned about the other loans since they are at fairly low interest rates, or am I okay paying them down slowly? Am I headed in the right direction?


Thanks r/personalfinance!",finance

cybersecurity,I recently passed my CEH Ethical Hacker exam but feel like I have no clue on the basics,"I recently finished a course in Cyber Security, passed my EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker exam as well as CompTIA Networking and Security exams, after completing them though I feel like I haven't got a clue where to start when it comes to simple basic things like Brute Forcing or SQL injection  
  
I've set up a practice lab at home using the DVWA test kit. When I attempt to practice with this kit, I just draw blanks and I'm unable to get anywhere with the task, I then move onto the next test\exercise\vulnerability and draw even more blanks, rinse and repeat until I get fed up with myself  
I tried hacking my way into https://www.hackthebox.eu/ yet I couldn't even figure out how to get past the most basic log in/access part  
I try to read blogs, posts, articles, Wikipedia pages etc on hacking and Cyber Security but I can never stay focused 

I generally feel like I have no idea what to do in this field, yet I've got these qualifications but somehow lack the basic skills to get anywhere. I'm no stranger to Computers, Hardware, Software or Simple Networking and I've done some simple object orientated programming, despite my lack of focus and intelligence I do have an interest in Cyber Security and Hacking    
  
The company I did the course with are great and offered a lot of support for me, they helped me when I needed it. Even now I still get e-mails from them about events/talks/shows that they have about Cyber Security, sadly I can't really attend any of them due to their location  
    
I guess I have no clue weather I should carry on down this career path, I spent 2 years on this course and was really looking forward to this area.   

I'm kinda hoping for some advice from you guys and gals who are already in field about what I should do?",technology
personalfinance,"What to do about an upside down car loan on a rapidly worthless, now-broken, car.","Background:
I'm a 26 year old male from the northeast US, I work full-time as a Software development contractor for $35/hr from home. I recently moved to a new apartment spending around $2,500, with $1,650 being first month and security, my monthly rent is $825 + Heat/electric. Prior I lived in a house at $50, but it included Water and trash and heat was exorbitantly expensive.

My SO lives with me but drives to work on a daily basis, her mother gifted her her car and does not approve of her being simply dropped off to work every day by me, while I drive the car. I am not on the insurance either. 

I have been saving my taxes on my invoices(~$15,000) but the move has cut up a large amount of my non-tax savings. 

Situation: 
Two and a half years ago I purchased a 2009 VW EOS for ~$10,000. At the time I was making ~$14/hour. The price I negotiated was $3,000 less than it was on the lot for and I felt good about my work. The term was 5 years and 13% APR due to some irresponsible spending and some family issues out of college, My credit score was ~620, majority being in 90% credit card usage. 

In the first year of my new position, making ~$70K/year I paid down all credit debt, which is slowly improving my score into the 670s.

About two weeks ago, a week after the move, I went to Lowes for a curtain rod extension and came out to my car having a rough idle followed by some clanks and then nothing. This turned out to be a failed timing chain that caused some massive internal damage to the engine. This is my current state:

* I have ~$2,500 in savings and access to ~$1,500 credit as it stands.


My question is: **What solutions give me a working form of winter transportation as soon as possible with the smartest spending?**

I have called VW USA for a beg and plead warranty coverage, denied. I considered second hand engines but as this engine is shared with Audi, the prices are very high. I have considered buying a used low cost car ($1,000) as an 'for emergency only' vehicle while I pay off the car I have, but that adds thousands in insurance I would have to pay, considering I would still have to hold insurance on the VW.

I do have a rather high income which should enable me to simply buy a new/used car at a dealership and possibly roll the current loan in and then pay it off in larger installments, giving me a reliable car to own for a long time with a warranty, but the simple amount I owe and a still low credit score still places me in a bad position and unlikely to be approved, let alone at a reasonable interest rate.

What should I do?

personalfinance,Income tax return and dependent status,"Hi everyone! I am currently in  my first year of college and am living with my parents who provide financial support for everything. Due to excess scholarship and  federal grants (not loans), my college is giving me a refund.

There’s total trust towards them for not stealing or mishandling the money. But my question is if I make my own credit union account, will the refund be seen as income and will I have to file for income tax return? Or can I still be counted as a dependent for my parents for the 2018 year? I don’t work and don’t have any sort of income.

personalfinance,Looking for advice with vehicle purchase,"Hello All,

Just want to gather some info and get some feedback. I plan on being able to feel comfortable purchasing a vehicle by the end of the year. I'm in no rush at all and am looking at making sure I get the right vehicle for the right price. I currently owe about $4k on my motorcycle, and plan on having that paid off by Dec. prior to buying a vehicle.

&amp;#x200B;

My motorcycle was bought about 4 years ago for about $13k and I am not the main title holder. My father and I went to the bank and the original plan was for him to cosign with me, but with my bad credit we agreed that he would be the main lien holder and I would be secondary on the loan. I have been paying him directly every month for the loan. I've since made efforts to improving my credit and am now about 640 credit score. I wish to boost this by going to the credit union transferring so that I am the main lien holder. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is that the best course of action or ?

	\- Should I ""buy"" the loan from him?

	\- Should I look to get the loan transferred? 

2. Will this run my credit?

	\- in turn will this change the interest rate?

\-  add a hard inquiry to my report?

3. Will paying off the loan once its on my credit raise my credit score enough for this process  to be worth it when buy another vehicle later this year?

\- For example, adding the hard inquiry on my score since I already have 2 from 12 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on buying a used truck, hopefully around $30k. I also plan on having my father cosign with me again due to his excellent credit. With my 640 (possibly more by Dec. after paying off the loan) and his what I assume to be at least 760 score, would a 3.0% rate be plausible at a credit union?

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure I can have all these questions answered if we \[my father and I\] just go into the credit union and ask, but I am genuinely looking for other people's educated opinions on the matter and hoping to either confirm what I am thinking is more or less correct or to get some insight on what I may be doing wrong.

I just finish school recently (3 months ago), moved in with my SO (rent) and got a job.

Since I have no emergency fund or any investments but I have a student debt I was thinking what is the most efficient/best way to get ahead in life and get rid of debt and just set myself up for the future as far as house and investment goes.

My current view is to only use half of my income and the other half pay 1100 towards student debt and 500 towards emergency fund for a year then shift the other 500 towards the student loan also. It has a 6.5% interest rate btw.

Or would I be better off paying minimum for student loan and invest the rest of my money into something? Quite a few of my friends make more than 6.5% over a year off of stock investments, then the net income would actually be more.

1. Far too much coverage. Before you've even installed you know the first area by heart and have seen the earlier bosses beaten multiple times.
2. The time between announcement and release honestly feels like centuries, to the point where you forget half of the shit you put on your wish list until it pops up ""NOW AVAILABLE!""
3. It can't ever just be the game, there always has to be an implosion of **Super Duper Double Whammy Express with extra cheese - also includes Season Pass 1 + 2, 1,500 Credit points and bonus exclusive skin!,** immediately overwhelming any potential consumer.
4. £50 became the standard asking price out of the gate, as well microtransactions being stuffed into any available digital orifice.

investing,How do you evaluate a stock?,"I consider myself an amateur. I've read, I've invested, I've made some money, and I've lost some money. I'm working hard to develop positive habits that will help me in this game. I LOVE to research, to learn everything about an investment I possibly can before pulling the trigger. It's fun. It reduces stress to go in prepared. I look at the fundamentals and the technicals. Recently I've been using a combination of [finviz.com](https://finviz.com) for screening and news, [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com) for charting the technicals, and cruising through reddit for commentary from peers.

First I decide what sector to research. I like value stocks right now. I think we're in [mid to late cycle](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/markets_sectors/sectors/si_business_cycle.jhtml?tab=sibusiness). The Fed is going to squeeze us and earnings are slowing accross the board. I'm looking for reliable companies with defensive attributes. I like utilities, industrials, healthcare, telecom, secular growth consumer goods. I like the boring stuff that's going to pay its 2% dividend without fail. I like a clean balance sheet and a company with a reliable history of earnings beats. I love a company that meets all of this critera, but still sports a Price/Earnings ratio 20% beneath the sector average. Add quarter/quarter earnings growth and a positive outlook, and we've met my critera. Bonus points for institutional ownership and insider buying.

Once I'm satisfied with the fundamentals, I chart the technicals. Where is this Stock trading relative to its 50, 100, 200 day SMAs? To its 52wk high/low? I like a beat down stock looking to break a key resistance. I won't pull the trigger, though, until I get a technical signal to confirm my fundamental analysis. Maybe that insider buying triggers some market interest and leads to a run, I see a volume spike and the price shoots through the 200 day SMA and breaks a key resistance, formation, or trend-line. Then I'm in.

I'm looking at $SNX right now, by the way.

worldpolitics,Investors Need A Mueller Hedge,"By Zach Ott

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

Investors are not taking the risk of the Mueller Investigation seriously.

At a minimum, equity investors need a hedge for this risk.

Gold exposure and holding stable currency, could help investors navigate this potential imminent threat to the equities market.

&amp;#x200B;

Wise investors not only make bets on what they believe will occur, but also hedge in case their thesis is wrong or mistimed. Recent news reports suggest that many key findings of the Mueller investigation could be released shortly after the Midterm Elections. There are a few indicators that lead me to believe that investors are not taking the risk of these findings seriously. In the worst-case scenario, the details of Mueller’s findings would likely cause a crash in the equity markets. Whether you believe this will happen or not, rational investors need to have a hedge for this worst-case scenario, which would likely cause a fall in the major equity indexes of over 30%. In this short article, I will lay out why investors should take this subject matter seriously, what the effect on the stock market could be and what strategies you can use to hedge your portfolio.

With the forward PE of the S&amp;P 500 close to 17, there likely are not many investors considering the near term risk that Mueller’s findings could have on the financial markets. There seems to be a prevailing theory that Trump is impervious to bad news in the long-run and that this would stay the case regardless of what information Mueller releases to the public. The problem is that if Trump really has been colluding with the Russian Government this whole time, the release of this information will put into question the global alliances between nations, including trade and military agreements. The uncertainty that this scenario brings would be devastating to the stock market in the short-term and I believe it is important to hedge your portfolio prior to the midterm elections and the release of Mueller’s findings.

As difficult it is to predict the exact damage to the price of the equities market in this worst-case scenario, I believe we would at least touch valuations seen the last time the direction of interest rates were an open question to most investors. I would expect to see at least a 30-35% drop in all three major equity indexes. The Nasdaq would likely take the biggest hit because there could be more negative information released about Facebook and Twitter. This is not meant to be a doomsday article, advising you to buy canned goods and hide in a bunker. My hope is that even in a scenario that includes collusion and impeachment, a new administration will work to bring us closer than ever to Europe, which would settle the markets in the long-term.

Gold exposure could be one of the surest bets in this scenario. I am choosing to keep holdings in gold ETF’s, as they will be a liquid way to trade and allow me to buy into stocks quickly, at lower prices during a sell-off. Holding the currency of a stable country that you live in, would also be a good way to have liquidity and bet on stability returning in the long-term. My choice is to do both, with a higher percentage of my assets in multiple gold ETFs, to provide me with liquidity and potential upside in this volatile scenario.

For a few reasons, this trade is the right move for my personal portfolio. I actually believe that a worst-case Mueller scenario is likely, so it would be difficult for me to invest in stocks with that mind-set. If I keep my gold/US dollar exposure through Mueller’s report and it turns out I am wrong, there are many other reasons why a gold position could increase in value going forward. With market valuations far from cheap historically, those scenarios include: a continued trade war hurting company earnings, a shift in the US political landscape after the midterms that scares investors and a potential political conflict with the Prince of Saudi Arabia, which causes a scare in the oil markets (MBS bringing down the markets for a second time). These additional scenarios could make my trade in gold right, even if I’m wrong.  If none of these scenarios pan out, gold prices are likely to be range-bound through Mueller’s first report, leaving me the option to sell a portion of my position.

Hedging your bets is such an important part of investing. In order to do it properly, investors need to see the potential scenarios in front of them and correctly identify what could be detrimental to their investment in the future. Currently I believe that equity investors are staring directly at the Mueller investigation and not recognizing it as a potential threat to the major stock indexes. That could prove to be a mistake. I hope this article helps you consider the near-term options to hedge your portfolio, until the public receive more information from Robert Mueller.

Seeing as renting costs more than a mortgage payment and I have just over 25.000 euros in savings, I've decided to buy a flat. I've found a flat that due to the owner being in debt to the Italian tax agency, is being sold for a very good price of 75.000 euros. Offer has been made, accepted, and now I need a mortgage. The bank is willing to give me 60.000 euros at an interest rate of 1.7%. This comes to roughly 300 euros a month for 20 years. Due to Italian law, I can't pay more than that a month.

Technically I only need 50.000 euros (closing costs, tax, and furniture for the flat have already been accounted for). Does it make sense for me to only ask for the 50k and shorten the length of the mortgage, or take the extra 10k seeing as the interest rate is low, and start investing into stocks/mutual funds/retirement funds.

Once I include bonuses, the remaining 700 euros or so a month went into savings for the house, now will go into savings/investments.

I really don't want the interest rates changing - that's my main concern - as the monthly payments are completely manageable and have been budgeted for as-is. 

Edit: What happens if I have to personally tie my name to it, assuming interest rate stays the same - will a car loan look good or bad on my credit? I have nothing on there at the moment except three credit cards.",finance

personalfinance,"Large increase in salary, how should i tackle my $13k cc debt?","I'm a 24 year old that has built up a lot of debt, but luckily i've landed a very well paying position getting paid a lot more than before. I wasnt as responsible with my money the past few years as i relied on my father but thats had to change in the past year. I'll try to keep this as straight forward as possible with all the necessary information.

I have 2 credit cards with a total of 13k debt across both, one is maxed at $10k with an APR of 23%, and the other with $3k out of $5k total with an apr of 16% but a balance transfer fee of 5%.

My expenses are as follows:  
$1k a month for rent  
$375/month car payment (bought a $20k car, paid off $7k so far)  
$270/month car insurance (had to switch to a solo-plan)  
$180/month for my phone bill (i pay for my mother and grandfather)  
My credit score has been mid 700s for the past few years but this last year has gotten it down to 650.

A quick explanation on my expenses, my Father covered most of my expenses growing up and even gave me 3K for my car while i was making $25k/year (this was 2 years ago) and soon after he had a falling out with the rest of my family and left to our home-country. This led to me working my ass off and getting used to paying for all of my things - which i obviously did not do well as i spent more than i should have and i was not accounting for my interest rate charge when paying off my cards which snowballed my debt into a bigger amount.

I applied for an american express Everyday card ($0 balance fee and 0 APR first year) but they're only letting me transfer $750 so that wont work for me. I plan to cancel the card.

Good news is:  
1. I got promoted to a position at the company i work in, the raise was from $38K/yearly to $60k/yearly not including bonuses. I currently take home around $3500 monthly.  
2. Hitting $10k/maxing out one of my cc really made me realize that i have to get my shit together and stop spending so irresponsibly.

I'm minimizing as many expenses as possible, i just need help figuring out whether to get a bank loan or to consider other options. What are my options? What kind of loan should i get if that's by best option? Should i consider filing for bankruptcy? Any advice would help. Im here to learn, i know i've been doing pretty bad so far and i want improve permanently. Thanks in advance.",finance

I had my identity comprimised earlier this year, ss, name, etc and they added themselves to my credit card.  I handled it fast, did all the right things (ie: police report, 7 year fraud alert, credit freezes, FTC reports, IRS pins, etc etc).  

Thought it was over, but here's what I can't understand....

I've started getting mail, to my house - with pre approved loan offers, to the same persons name who stole my identity and added themself to the credit card originally.  That was concerning, but wait theres more...

&amp;#x200B;

Today I try to setup some package instructions for a fedex package, so I have to go through the fedex website to create an account and basically verify my info before I can make any changes.  Well one of the questions for verifying my info said ""click the name below of a person who has lived at this address"".  The names were all unknown names to me, except one: the name of the person who stole my identity.  My ACTUAL name was not even on there, and there was no choice for ""none of the above"".

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know - where do these companies get their information from??? Because it seems like thats where I'm still comprimised somehow. I feel helpless in this, and feel like although I've checked all the boxes for normal action I'm still under attack here.

personalfinance,Should I buy out my lease or trade in my car?,"Sorry, this is a long one..it’s kind of a two part question. First, what are my general end of lease options. Second, I need advice on what I should do for my specific situation. 

About the current car/lease

-2016 Ford Fusion Energi with carpool stickers that expire in January

-The lease ends in February 

-The lease mileage limit is 90,000 miles. I currently have about 80,000 and should be just under the allotted mileage when the lease ends, so not worried about those fees

-The amount due at the end of the lease is about $11,350 +taxes &amp; fees, which I’m estimating to come to a total of about $13,000. 

-I have enough saved to purchase the car at the end of the lease so am not worried about financing if I purchase

-I think the hybrid battery warranty ends at 100,000 miles 

-I like my car and if I end up replacing it, I would get a newer version of the same thing, so don’t have to worry about shopping around in that aspect

Now the questions..

Part One

I’ll start off by saying my original plan was to purchase my car from the start, but I ended up leasing it (with the intention of buying it out after the lease ended) because I got a significant amount in rebates up front vs. less back via tax returns later if I purchased. 
I’ve never leased or purchased a car from a dealer so I’m not clear on my options, but I think I have three: 

1. Return the car and not replace it 

2. Purchase the car when the lease is up 

3. Return the car and lease a new one. 

I already know option one is out for me, so my question is should I just purchase the car flat out, or trade it in? 

-Is there any monetary value if I return the lease and get a new one, or would I simply be giving it back and starting over again with a new lease? I see this as basically renting the car for 3 years and getting nothing in return which doesn’t sound appealing 

-There is a small mark on the bumper where someone swiped me that I’m sure could be buffed out with a detail but I wouldn’t fix if I’m going to keep it. The dealer said I have to get the car inspected before I purchase it (if I decide to go that route). Would I be charged to fix this even if I am going to buy it, or is the inspection just to note any damage so I can’t try to blame them later? 

Part Two

I drive a lot for work and use the carpool lane everyday. Not using this lane is not an option for me and I don’t plan on moving or getting a new job in the next two to three years. 
With that in mind, the car currently has stickers that allow me to use the lane toll-free, but they expire in January. 
The way I see it, I basically have two options for this: 

1. Pay the the toll, which varies from 50 cents to $8 per section of highway, and I go through 3 sections each morning and evening. So, if I’m doing my math right, tolls could be anywhere from $3.00 to $48.00 everyday. To be fair it’s rarely up to $8.00 (maybe once a week or so), usually more like the $3.00-$5.00 range, but it’s all based on traffic so it’s hard to nail down exact cost. 

2. Get a new car with new stickers that will let me continue to use the lane toll-free. 

I am trying to weigh all my options taking into consideration toll lane access, warranty running out, and high mileage in general on this type of vehicle.

Thanks in advance for any and all advice!

personalfinance,Taking out a personal Loan to consolidate credit card debt and car loan good idea for me or not?,"Hey everyone just a question about my situation. About 3 years ago I totaled my first car. This caused me to basically rush to buy a new one and didn't do any research on actually buying a car without credit. Needless to say I ended up with a car loan with a 9.99% interest rate and a $222.96 monthly payment for 6 years (currently about to hit year 4) the remaining outstanding balance is 5,310.05. 

Also with in this time frame my parents got a Divorce and this has led to me living with my dad because my mom gave him the house and she is currently living in an apartment. Now this wouldn't of been so bad but, my dad is rarely home since he got this new job and so he basically never buys food for in the house for me and my sister. 

So while my parents where still together I applied for a couple of credit cards so I could start working on my credit score. Everything was going well. I was using them basically as my debt card and would always pay them off in full, but after the divorce I have accumulated a total of credit card debt of 3122.06 trying to feed myself and keep up with my vehicle insurance and maintenance. I've basically hit my breaking point and I'm starting to panic because my car is currently 7 months past the required state inspection. I'm also paying my credit card debt at the minimum payment and making zero progress towards paying it off. Refinancing my car is impossible due to the fact that its a 2006 model.

I've been trying to figure out my options and I keep coming back to a personal loan is my only option and consolidate everything so I only have 2 monthly payments (My car insurance and the personal loan.) This would make my total debt for the loan be 8435.01 with the current payoff quote for my car loan.",finance

I found this link last night..

[https://www.money-zine.com/calculators/loan-calculators/wage-garnishment-calculator/](https://www.money-zine.com/calculators/loan-calculators/wage-garnishment-calculator/)

My biweekly is 600

Medicare 8.70

Social Security 37.20

State 11.00

Take Home $543

I read online my state allows the fed max of 25% for wage garnishment..

I simply cannot afford my payments. I am married, he also works.. combined last year AGI was 47,342

I expended the under employed deferment... I contacted my loan holder, Great Lakes and they suggested the ""Pay as you Earn"" which would put my payments $47 more than they are now.

Here is my story (if anyone cares, or if it is relevant)... We both have health problems, but not enough to warrant social security, nor do I want that yet.. we're barley making it with me working only part time... We were in two massive car accidents 11 months apart, in 2015 and 2016 (at no fault of out own). We're still trying to dig out of that hole. I admit that living off the CC during that time was stupid but we thought things would return to normal ... since then our plan was to file bankruptcy but shit just keeps coming up.. the most we've been able to save is 800 and then we had to replace all four tires, dad had a heart attack, husband had to have a kidney stone removed etc..

Anyway we thought we'd bounce back. He did somewhat - his health probs are unrealted to the accident but still, he misses work and we lose income. I never did bounce back fully... So anyway, I no longer work full time. Which has helped anyway because both my parents are disabled and my brother split.

I do all their shopping, driving to and from appointments, meal planning and prepping and all of the cleaning..

We live in a tiny one bedroom house so they cannot live with us, (because they ask about dependents when talking to the loan advisors) -  I did find them an all utilities included apartment for 525 right behind my house, which leaves them with roughly 187 a month.. Soo I end up covering the difference and paying for all medications.. which is running about 300 a month.. Which (and I get it) they could care less about..

My current payment is set at $204. I called and said I could reasonably do $75 and still afford to eat and what not.. that is when they said fill this and that out..

Okay this is getting long.. I used that link and I think I did it correctly, but by that calculator my garnishments would be around 80 a month.. which is close to the wiggle room I could find in my budget.

Credit and all that aside, I need to maintain my flexible income NOW due to health issues and caring for parents.

Two questions, did I do the math right.. and am I crazy to think that allowing the garnishment is my best option?

personalfinance,W-4 advice,"I’m a little confused when filling out a W-4 for myself and my wife now that we’re married with a child and one on the way. We’ve always claimed 0 to get the most taxes back at the end of the year but I’ve been told that may not be the best route for us going forward. 

I’m military and we’re both residents of Maine but someone also advised me that maybe she should become a resident of Virginia, where I’m stationed, to get a lower tax break. Should she or I do that? 

Should we also continue to claim 0 or should I claim the kids or the full 8-10 exemptions? I definitely don’t want to pay in at the end of the year but getting a few extra $$ each pay period as well as a decent tax return at the end of the year sounds good too. 

Because I’m military my housing allowance isn’t taxable so we both make roughly 72,000$ before taxes (92,000$ with my housing allowance). Federal is 270$ a month for me and about 260$ a month for her. State is 154$ for me and 50$ for her because I’m still a Maine resident and she’s paying VA taxes since she’s employed in VA.",finance

personalfinance,Does debt die with your spouse?,"Mom visited last weekend and we talked lightly about finances because she'll be retiring in a few years. She remarried about 15 years ago to a guy who has not held a full-time job since shes known him. He finished his Bachelor's degree while they were together, and continued through his master's. I've lost track of degrees earned because he seems to always be taking courses but never arriving at a destination. They're in their mid 60's and he's currently taking a prerequisite course for a very different field of study from that of his Master's. At this point, nobody really believes he's going to start working in a full time career. So I asked my mom, half-joking, if he's constantly in classes in order to continue deferring payments on the loans. As moms are wont to do, she dismissively shrugged and indicated that that could be the case. I asked what she'll do when the loans come due, and how bad of shape she will be in if he dies before her (reasonable possibility due to health concerns). She said it would be at least another mortgage payment, which she couldn't afford, but she's not worried because, as she stated, ""the debt dies with him.""

It seems reasonable to think that debt existing before the marriage may continue in the name of the individual. But it seems like debt accrued during the marriage would be considered a joint responsibility. I'm very much wanting her to be right, but that doesn't seem like a reasonable assumption.

Followup question: I dont know that he'll be able to continue taking classes up until his very last breath. Suppose as his health declines, he ends up unable to continue courses. Is there any way, short of declaring bankruptcy, that he would not become liable to begin paying on this student loan?

If he has medical bills piling up at the same time as student loan payment kick in, I fear it could ruin her. But it seems unreasonable to think that people lending the money are going to simply write it off. Is there any way that she doesn't get blind sided by reality when his time is up?

Quick background: when my wife and I bought our current car, we didn't have great credit. In fact, the place we bought it from inflated the cost of the car to make it seem like we put more money down (I don't recall the exact numbers, but it was something like we paid $12,000 with $1,000 down, but the dealer said the car cost $15,000 and we put $4,000 down).

That was a couple years ago, we've made almost every payment on time (missed one once because I thought I'd paid it and hadn't, but took care of that the next month), and my credit score is pretty good now.

I'd like to see about getting a better interest rate on that car.

Additionally, we need a second car. My wife would like to take a loan out on it in her name to help her build her credit. I'm wondering if I could cosign on it to help her get a better deal.

Finally, I'm wondering if it might be possible to take care of both of those at once; e.g. go to our bank, take out a loan to pay off the first car *and* get enough to purchase the second.

personalfinance,"Contemplating my next move, looking for insight and information. (long read)","(TL;DR) 
I made mistakes helping others, screwed my credit and lowered my annual income. I have 3 assets which include a financed car, 401k roth and employment profit share. my credit score is under 490, 34k unsecured debt (10k is federal student loans) and 14k loan remaining on the car. 

i'm considering chapter 13 or debt consolidation, chapter 7 if I have to. I want to keep the car. I do not know if cheaper 13 will affect future student loans, I don't know if chapter 7 and/or 13 will affect my roth or profit share, and I don't know if I'd qualify for a consolidation loan for 24k with my credit that would be a benefit. 

(more detailed) 
 I screwed up my financial security by helping those closest to me, only to have that help abused or thrown back in my face. Anyway, i'm now so far in debt that I can't even keep with minimum payments with my current income. 

roughly 14k remaining auto loan with 9% interest rate
various credit cards totaling around 15k with varying interest rates from 19% to 23%
hospital bills with an unclear total 0, 9k, or 24k
federal student loans currently totaling 10k and increasing as I continue my education with an interest rate of 3%

 my annual income has decreased from 29k to 20k and my credit score has greatly suffered dropping from 695 to 485 over the last year. about 1700 to 1800 monthly cost with about 1300 monthly net income minus 3 months per year. I have a 401k roth totaling around 4,500 and a profit share around 5,000.

 I do not want to consider chapter 7 because I would like to keep my car which is pretty much the only thing I'm current on.
 
with chapter 13, or chapter 7, I am concerned how that would effect future financial aid for school.  I don't expect it to effect future major purchases ie a house as my credit should have recovered by the time i'm ready for that but i'm unsure if renting would be effected as my renting history is never late and mostly one month ahead.

 that leaves debt consolidation, im concerned that I would not be approved for better with my credit score under 500. it would only be to consolidate credit cards and hospital bills so I'd say the median of 24k debt. 

I am unsure which route is the better option.  apply for chapter 13 and risk losing financial aid for schooling seeking an engineer career or try to get a debt consolidation loan that I may not be able to pay monthly unless the rate and monthly payment are significantly better. or just apply for chapter 7 and completely restart, losing everything. I know my current federal student loans will remain unaffected regardless. I also have no idea how the various options would affect my profit share through employment and 401k roth fund.",finance

personalfinance,Back to school financial planning,"Hi there!  I'm 31, with about $20k in savings and $15k in a retirement account.  I want to go back to school for a second bachelors - still looking into the details of how possible that is, but I wanted to see how the costs would work out while doing that investigation. 

Assume for the sake of argument that I'm quitting my job tomorrow and starting school in the spring.

First, it's my understanding that I can not expect federal student aid (income too high), though I'm curious whether that will change if I quit my job to go to school full time?  Does FAFSA just look at your prior year's tax return?

With regards to my retirement account, I gather that if I withdraw funds to put toward school, I can avoid paying a penalty but will need to report it as income - not a big deal if I'm no longer working, right?  And would it make sense to up my contribution to the maximum $5,500 for this year prior to going in next year?  Are there rules about when you can withdraw those funds, or could I eg deposit $5,500 cash next January and withdraw it in July for tuition?  Or, would that not even confer at tax advantage (ie if tuition is already deductible in the same way)?

Finally, how is all this affected by this being my second degree, and is there a more appropriate sub that I should be asking these questions in?

personalfinance,"Ally personal banking nightmare (cashiers check, fraud hold, endless phone calls, misdelivered checks)","tldr; Ally Bank is fine so long as you don't have any special banking needs, like ordering a cashiers check in a timely manner, or getting checks printed with a different address on them (in anticipation of moving to a new address). If you need to change your account address (not the mailing address) and get a cashiers check, they will screw you over and over and over...

I switched to Ally after getting fed up with customer service problems at Chase. I liked that they pay interest (very little) on their checking account and they aren't a big evil bank. (Sure, Ally is just GMAC rebranded, but they can't be as bad as Chase or Wells Fargo, right?) Everything went well for the first year, until I needed a cashiers check for an upcoming move to a new rental house.

First, some background - Los Angeles is a very tight housing market (especially for rentals), and once you find your new home, you have to secure it with a lease and deposit asap to avoid losing it to someone else. I was given a 60 day notice to vacate my current rental house several weeks ago, and that's not a lot of time to find a new place AND move there.

Once I found a new rental, I called Ally Bank to update my ACCOUNT address so I could order new personal checks, but I left my MAILING address the same since I didn't have possession of the new property yet. (I didn't want 100 new checks printed with my OLD address on them). I agreed to pay $48 for 2-day expedited shipping on the personal checks because I needed them for upcoming expenses. I also made the CSR on the phone review BOTH addresses, and assure me the checks would have the NEW address printed on them, but would be delivered to the OLD (mailing) address.

The next day I signed the lease and called Ally back to order a $4000 cashiers check. I promised the landlord I would deliver the security deposit via cashiers check (his request) in 3 days, after verifying that Ally could get a cashiers check mailed to me in 2 days. I thought everything was going fine, considering Ally doesn't have retail banking locations. I even left a 1 day cushion in case the mail was late, etc.

The next day, I checked my Ally account online and saw that the $4000 hadn't been withdrawn from my account. I called Ally to see if there was a problem. At first, the CSR on the phone was evasive and cagey, and seemed reluctant to tell me what was going on. She said there was a ""fraud case"" opened on my account, and that was blocking the cashiers check. I got a little frustrated, and explained the time-sensitive nature of the cashiers check and mentioned that I had not gotten a phone call or text or email about the fraud hold. She wouldn't give me any info, and instead tried to call ""Stephen"" from their TX fraud dept. Stephen didn't answer her call, so she gave me his direct number and recommended that I email a copy of my drivers license, SSN card, and a bill with the new address on it to their fraud dept email. I explained that I didn't HAVE a bill with the new address on it, BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIVE THERE YET. Also, I haven't seen my SSN card in years - it's filed away somewhere safe! She eventually explained the fraud hold was placed because I recently changed my address, then ordered a large cashiers check. I explained that I left my MAILING address the same, and that shouldn't indicate fraud. Besides, changing your account address with your bank and ordering a cashiers check is a common situation - if you're moving! She couldn't help me any further and recommended I call Stephen on my own to figure out what to do.

So I called Stephen, every 15 minutes for the next 2.5 hours. I left a VM on the first call, but I heard nothing back. Since he's working in Texas and it was after 5pm there, I eventually figured he had just gone home for the day, and didn't give a shit about my situation. I finally went to a local Wells Fargo and opened a brand new checking account so I could wire money to it and have a cashiers check printed the next day.

Finally, about 3 hours later, Stephen called me back. I explained the time crunch I was under, and that I had under 30 days to vacate my current rental house. I also explained that LA is a very tight housing market, and if I didn't have a cashiers check in 2 days, I could lose the new rental property and myself and my fiancee could find ourselves basically homeless, living in a motel in a few weeks (it took us a month to find the new rental). Stephen was not moved, I would still need to email the 3 docs to prove my identity. I told him I didn't have a bill with the new address on it, and I had no idea where my SSN card was. I also asked him why it was suspected fraud that I updated the account address and ordered a cashiers check, but left my MAILING address the same... How did that indicate fraud? Even if a criminal had done these things to my account, I would still receive the cashiers check AT MY HOME and return it to the bank! Furthermore, Stephen had called ME on my cellphone, which is the number listed on the account, so clearly I can't be impersonating myself while talking to him RIGHT NOW. Stephen refused to listen to any amount of logic, and couldn't care less about the stress I was going through. I thanked him for ""doing a wonderful"" job and hung up.

The next day, the wire went through and Wells Fargo issued me a $4000 cashiers check on the spot. No fraud hold, no endless phone calls, no Stephen telling me I'm not who I say I am, demanding I send numerous docs to prove my identity.

That's the end of my problems with Ally, right?

A few days later, I realized that in all the madness I was going through, I had totally forgotten about the Ally personal checks I ordered, which, because I paid an extra $48, should have been delivered three days ago. I needed the personal checks THAT DAY to make the last rent payment on my current house! I again called Ally to find out where the checks were and was amazed to hear they were shipped to the NEW address! This was driving me insane, because I didn't have possession of the new property and SPECIFICALLY confirmed with the CSR who ordered my checks that they would NOT be sent to the new address! The current CSR on the phone put a stop payment on all the checks (in case they were stolen) and recommended I try to retrieve them from the new property. I didn't know if that was possible, because if they were pushed through the mail slot in the front door, I wouldn't be able to get them for another 2 weeks. I also demanded that the $48 expedited delivery fee be waived because the checks were sent to the wrong location, but she said her ""system"" didn't allow her to waive fees ahead of time, and that I would have to call back (again!) to have the fee reversed AFTER it had posted to my account. Infuriating!

I drove to the new address and was relieved (sort of) to find the checks sitting on the front porch. I was only partially relieved, because I knew they were sitting there for 3 days, and anyone could have stolen them while they were in the open, at a vacant house. I called Ally back (this is call number 5!) to have the stop payment reversed on the new personal checks. The CSR told me it would cost $15 to do so. I wanted to scream into the phone. I asked to have the fee waived since it wasn't my fault that the checks were missing for 3 days. Guess what? She told me she couldn't waive the fee ahead of time, that I would have to call back a SIXTH time to have the fee reversed.

I gave up on Ally at that point and moved all my funds to Wells Fargo. Sure, Wells Fargo has done terrible TERRIBLE things to literally MILLIONS of people in the last few years, but they handed me a cashiers check THE SAME DAY I asked for it, AND mailed my personal checks to my CURRENT address with the NEW address printed on them!!! MAGIC! The guy who opened my account there even waived the $10 cashiers check fee for me - BEFORE it posted to my account!!! Amazing.

On my last call, I mentioned I wanted to escalate my issues to someone at Ally, and the phone rep said she would do so, and that I would be contacted in a couple days by phone about my experience. Instead of a phone call, I received an impersonal email from ""Ryan"" at Ally's escalation dept. The email detailed my recent transactions (with no mention of the failed cashiers check or fraud hold) in a cold and trite way, and didn't list any of the difficulties I experienced and explained to the phone CSRs. There wasn't even an apology from Ally, just a single line at the end of the email that said they ""regret"" if any of my interactions with the bank ""did not meet my expectations."" Ridiculous. If they had simply used the words ""we're sorry,"" it would have made a much larger impact. I replied to the email and added ALL the details that Ryan (probably a computer system, and not a real person) left out, but was dismayed to see that the reply-to email was a generic email box at Ally, and not even a direct email to this supposed ""Ryan"" person. I don't expect to ever hear back from him or anyone at Ally over all this ridiculous, infuriating madness they caused.

The bottomline is, if you need anything more than a debit card and personal checks, or if you have any kind of unique situation (printing new checks with a different address on them), Ally will most likely screw you over HARD. Their fraud dept is cold and inhumane, even when faced with the possibility that their incompetence could basically leave two people homeless. Their CSRs have very little power to do anything, particularly preempting fees when Ally clearly screwed up.

personalfinance,Samsung Trade-In Program,"I apologize for how long this may be and pardon my errors, I'm on mobile. 

I didn't know if this was the right thread to do this. I got the Note 9 when it came out. I decided to do the trade-in program and I sent in my iPhone 6. I used FedEx and got a receipt. I had 15 days to mail the iPhone to Samsung. I sent the iPhone back immediately. Fast forward to Sept. 18 and Samsung says that I never sent a phone so they'll be charging me $200 (to pay for the rest of the Note 9). They had pictures attached that showed an empty box. So I called Samsung and told them I sent the phone, they said let us investigate and call back in three days. I called back in three days and they said they needed more information. I was able to then show, through the FedEx receipt, that I had indeed sent a package with something in it because it did weigh something. I gave my receipt number to Samsung and they said they can pull up my info. I was even told that my receipt info showed that I had indeed sent something back. Then they said give them five days to investigate. Called back after five days and they said that investigations take ten days. So I called back after ten days. They then said that investigations take at 30 days from the initial start of the case. So I would have to wait until October 18. 

My wife and I decided to use her credit card for the rewards and we had the money already set aside. But because Samsung was investigating, and the due date for the trade-in product passed, they charged us the $200. So we disputed the charge with her credit card company and they denied it. 

So now October 18 came and I called Samsung. They said that investigations take an ""indefinite"" amount of time. I have complained to them. I've asked to speak to all sorts of departments and no answers. I know it's just $200 but I feel like I've been robbed. 

Is there anything I can do to get this money back?",finance

personalfinance,Should I overpay or stick to minimum payments on a loan for a car that I'm currently trying to sell?,"Hi there. First post here, so please bear with me- I read through the rules and the wiki and didn't see anything directly pertaining to my questions so hopefully this is OK.

I currently have a personal loan out that I got for a secondary car that I bought as a ""toy"" (I know, not very PF friendly, I agree) and am paying more than the minimum payment on. I have decided that I don't have the space or the need for a secondary car, so I've been trying to sell it. Being a rear wheel drive ""sporty"" car in an area that gets snow, I'm not too optimistic that it'll sell soon, so I'm expecting to be paying a few more months' worth on the loan. The payments are nowhere near sinking me, I'm just trying to make the wisest choice here.

My question is this: Would it be best to keep overpaying on the loan for as long as I own the car, or would it be better to reduce my payments to the minimum required by the loan terms? Essentially- which way would I end up paying less interest on the loan?

I'm probably going to share too much info here, but I figure that's better than not enough. Here's info on the loan:

* Opening amount: $7000 USD

* Opening date: 04/13/2018

* Loan term: 36 months

* Regular payment amount: $216.07 (sidenote: am I right in thinking this is the minimum required monthly payment?)

* Current monthly payments (manually chosen): $420

* Current remaining balance: $4678.16

* Interest paid YTD: $198.16

I can't get the bank website to give me the exact interest rate, but I can tell you that across the 6 monthly payments (May-October) of $420 each made so far, between ~$30-38/month has been paid toward interest. 

I'm sure this is an obvious answer to some, but for some reason interest is just all Greek to me. My brain just doesn't keep a grasp on it.

Secondary questions- 

I was intending on putting any money from my tax return (likely ~$1500+) into paying off this loan if the car didn't sell by Spring, especially if I were to maintain the current over-payments. Is that entirely foolhardy?",finance

investing,"I'm only 29 years old, i'm no expert, but I have a legitimate question i'm hoping the Reddit community can help address about housing bubbles in markets outside the US.","Economics Question. 

If a housing bubble existing in the USA collapsed international markets in 2008, would a housing bubble occurring in Asia, Australia, Europe and New Zealand collapse international markets in the near future? 

Why do I ask?

When I visited China last month, I learned that an apartment in Beijing and Shanghai costs $10,000 USD per sq. ft. Yeah, whoah! Not only this, but the inflation rate is so high that investing in real estate wouldn't have paid off. Would be nice to have someone validate this. 

When in Qingdao, I witnessed a decades worth of infrastructure and I can't put this observation into words.... 11km tunnel, 15 mile bridge and modern buildings 25 times the size of Hartford constructed within 10 years to accommodate a population that significantly overpowers US residents. 

I have an economics professor staying with my wife and I via our AirBnB this week. Naturally inclined to learn more about his work, I read 2 of his articles: 

1) Article on housing prices from 2015 (Take a look at the figure on Page 17): [http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/qfeng/FengWu\_20150206.pdf](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/qfeng/FengWu_20150206.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1ZA3jesxIyTk5A0STEBmkVuuRRh8tbVi7SjK6xerSSdebn7VhAjM4_wK4)

If a housing bubble exists in asian markets and the system collapses...will this will have greater impact on international trade (especially on the US market) at a time when interest rates are rising and trade wars are developing. 

My wife, who is Kiwi, has seen her family home increase 10x in the last decade. 

Housing prices are not increasing significantly in the US and company earnings are still positive, but something tells me that the threat lies elsewhere.

personalfinance,Construction loan questions,"We’ve been thinking about purchasing a home in the near future but we cannot really see a house that checks our boxes. So we came across the possibility of building a home. We don’t have the land yet either. A quick search told me that construction loans apparently have higher interest rates (5.34% for example). I know that there are also a bunch of other requirements and it’s a bit more complicated than just buying and existing house. I have several questions, so please advise if you have any knowledge or experience with this kind of loans. 

1. Do we need to buy the land on our own and then apply for a construction loan using the land as collateral? 
2. Are there requirements as to what builder performs the work or can we hire anyone of our choosing?
3. Is it harder to qualify for a construction loan than for a regular loan?

I am currently making $145K with full benefits and unlimited vacation with my current company , but my job is kind of slowing down and I need some challenge. I could ask them to transfer to another program but it will be a long commute for me.

I am leaning toward $85/hr but don't know if it is the right decision? Thanks for your inputs.

Edit: I will not have over time pay, if I had to work longer hours, I could work shorter hours the next day. All my families live on the other side of the world so three weeks vacation is mandatory for me since it's already takes a week to travel with the time changes. I never took long vacation other than those trip even tho I have unlimited vacation.

I am trying to do everything possible to get my student loans down to a manageable level but nothing seems to be working.

I currently work full time 45k a year take home and I have 180k in student loans with an interest rate of 8%

I was told the lowest amount I could pay a month was $1600 and with my rent ($800) and other expenses I don’t have much (50-100) extra to put towards anything substantial. I currently do not put anything towards a 401k because there isn’t enough extra income in case of emergency or anything like that.

My goals are to save for a house with my wife, to invest into our retirement, and to have a savings with a fun budget.

As if stand right now I’m scraping by on the loan payments and they are the only expense that could be reduced to help facilitate saving. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance
investing,Market perspective from an investment firm,"So I'd like to give my two cents as i feel a lot of these posts dig into the technicals of certain stocks and i feel like no one ever talks about the broad markets.

&amp;#x200B;

Background on me; i work on the sales desk of an investment firm on the east coast that manages 450 billion in assets and i directly cover the big wirehouses. What does this mean? Financial Advisors that manage hundreds of millions of dollars from UBS, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo Advisors, Etc. call me up and ask me how to allocate money into their portfolios using our funds, SMAs and private placements. The following are the themes that the biggest FAs ask about the most.

&amp;#x200B;

Rising rates: obviously we are in a rising rate environment which means that fixed income has severe headwinds. We think that money should be allocated to fixed income that has low overall duration. The spread between a 2 and 10 year treasury is around 30-50 bps which means you are still being compensated well on the shorter part of the curve. digging into munis the following stats apply: a 5 year muni bond gets around 70% of the 30 year yield curve, a 10 year muni gets 80% of the yield curve and a 15 year bond gets 90% of the yield curve. this obviously shows the yield curve is flattening and the most highest yield per duration spot is around 5-10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

credit spreads: credit spreads are at all time lows. the amount of compensation between BBB to AAA is as low as it was in 2007. what does this mean? you should look for good yields in fixed income but you shouldn't take on too much credit risk when doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

Equities: equities are coming off a 10 year bull run. however, many technicals are pointing to the bull run continuing and the recession still being in the distant future. we prefer to look at corporate profits as an indicator to how profitable equities are. Though there has been recent volatility companies are still making profits and they are servicing their debts with defaults hovering at all time lows around 1-2%. once companies start defaulting on debt and high yield credit spreads start blowing out there should be a concern of equities going seriously negative. i would position in higher quality companies that have a low debt-equity ratio and have lower vol.

&amp;#x200B;

international/emerging markets: this area of the market is obviously troubled. a lot of this has to do with the strengthening dollar as well as the increased political risk from US tariffs on Europe and Asia/pacific. i think in time this area of the market will turn around as the US ease up ands as rates stop rising from the fed and we begin quantitate easing from our central bank.

&amp;#x200B;

a few broad allocation suggestions: get into higher quality equities in the case of a downturn of the market, specifically look at the downside capture of a certain fund/etf. de-risk from high yield credit into investment grade. if you have higher yielding credit, look to switch into floating rate loans which have a lower duration and are senior secured debt in the line of credit. if you seriously think there will be a recession i would look at moving your equity positions into government backed vehicles that have a yield around 3% and wait for the pullback. also finally dont freak out, this is normal market volatility, in the grand scheme of a market cycle you cannot be the fearful investor.",finance
economy,How does Moroccan monetary policy work?,"Trying to understand how monetary policy works in the Moroccan economy.

Background: Morocco has a progressive tax structure. They also have a Value Added Tax applied on all goods and services. Their fiscal policies appear to be similar to those in most western democracies, except that the Moroccan Dirham is a closed currency (i.e. a currency that can only be legally traded inside the host economy).

Although tourism is the third biggest money generating sector of the economy (behind agriculture and phosphate excavation; and, so far as profit margins go, it is probably first), except for the receipts we were issued for admission to tourist sites, tickets we were issued for transport, payment we made for lodgings and tourist taxes payed in the hotels, my wife and I never saw any receipts for meals or store items purchased. Although guidebooks suggested that tourists only take taxis that had meters in them, we did not see any local taxis with meters in them and were never issued official receipts. It was also obvious that prices varied considerably between what tourists paid and what locals paid. Furthermore, official guides and their accomplices did not pay for meals in ""approved"" restaurants, or for taxis or for their admission to tourist sites, though as regards the sites, they were issued entry passes.

How is it possible that a significant portion of the most profitable economic activity in an economy can be allowed to pass under the finance minister’s radar?

I was not able to find much literature on Morocco’s monetary policies and what I did find focused on exchange rates and price stability models.

My guess is that the Moroccan Dirham is systematically devalued by the finance minister.

economy,NEWPORT LEGACY ZURICH SWITZERLAND: UNRAVELLING OF EMERGING MARKETS AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON NEW ZEALAND,"**Newport Legacy wealth management Zurich Switzerland Agree to this article.**

The underlying economic troubles in emerging markets surfaced recently with Turkey, Argentina and India making headlines as their markets tumbled.

Meanwhile, trade tensions between China and the United States have brought an even more cautious tone across international markets.

While the New Zealand stock market has been able to navigate most of these headwinds to date, concerns are growing over the contagion risk emerging markets pose to our economy.

China and emerging markets were, to a large degree, the saviours of the global economy during the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, as their ability to take on debt and stimulate demand helped to support the global recovery.

New Zealand’s connections with China also allowed us to largely sidestep the economic pain felt across the United States and Europe – as the nation became a more important regional trading partner, and credit creation from China and other emerging markets supported domestic property markets.

Now, looking to the future, it may not be trade tariffs that stand to be China’s biggest challenge – but this massive expansion of credit, and the extreme level of both personal and corporate debt it has created.

In an attempt to manage this problem, China’s government has continuously stepped in to stimulate growth, but there are tell-tale signs this has become unsustainable – as it now takes more than USD$4 of debt to generate just USD$1 of economic growth.

Overcapacity is a major issue and poses a significant deflationary risk to the rest of the world as China looks to export their economic imbalances. It’s this threat which has prompted the subsequent push-back from the United States in the form of increased tariffs.

Turning to the emerging markets, many see the growth in US currency and interest rates as the cause of their troubles. In reality, these markets had been showing signs of economic stress for some time before the USD started to strengthen – and the increasing value of the USD is not the cause but a consequence of weakening local emerging market economies and domestic currency imbalances.

Excessive government spending, the likes of which we’re seeing in Venezuela and Brazil, has led to dislocations and loss of investor confidence, followed by a flight of capital that has putting additional pressure on those currencies.

This in turn increases the cost of servicing debts denominated in foreign currencies, predominantly USD – increasing the demand for USD, and helping to drive its value even higher. This cycle feeds on itself and increases the domestic economic risks.

Ultimately, this has caused the breakdown of synchronised global economic growth, with emerging markets being unable to maintain the pace of growth set during the initial years of the current, decade-long global economic recovery.

This could be further amplified by the divergent monetary policies we’re seeing from the central banks of developed and emerging markets – which could further tighten financial conditions in emerging markets, benefiting the US dollar and seeing emerging market economies stagnate.

Domestically, we have seen the NZD devalue by over 15 per cent this year, from its January highs – and despite a cheaper currency, exports have not experienced a major lift, with our trade deficit widening in September.

Australia has experienced a similar depreciation, with the AUD down 15.8 per cent over the same period.

With the combination of this slowing global demand for Kiwi exports, coupled with a weaker NZD and stronger oil prices, this could mean challenging times ahead in the form of greater pressure on businesses and consumers.

While concerns over emerging markets are valid, the good news is that the New Zealand economy is unlikely to fall off a cliff anytime soon – but rather we may experience a period of stagnation as our major trading partners work through their overcapacity and saturated debt levels.",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing Vs. Consolidation Student Loans,"Hello Personalfinance! My wife and I are recently graduated pharmacy school and now our grace period is ending soon. Added up, our loans are at 500k, split pretty evenly. My wife has a full time 40 hour job out of school, but I am working a Part time position (no guarantee in hours) but have been working steady 32-35 hours a week. Income for her is roughly 125/yr and mine (assuming it stays similar) is around 100/yr.  

I am looking at differences between refinancing vs consolidating our loans. My loans are split 100k at Wells Fargo (private loan) and 150k via great lakes. Wells Fargo interest rate is 8.52% (highest at 10.99%). Great lakes interest rate is 5.68%. My wife has all her loans via great lakes, with average interest rate of 7%. 

Currently we are looking at different payment options, and from reading personal finance previous posts, it looks like refinancing my loans look to be the best option due to the aggressive interest rates. Figured my wife would benefit from it as well, but really wasn't sure what the best options were or how to research such a situation. So I was hoping if anyone has any good advice on where to look for solid information between refinancing/consolidation, or a way to understand which sites are reputable or not. Currently looking at SoFi for refinancing, regardless, any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Not sure what I should pay off first?,"Hello experts... I NEED your help please!

&amp;#x200B;

I am in a bit of a pickle.  Basically I have a few bills and have a few extra hundred a month, and I don't know the best place to put it.  Here's a rundown about me: 29yr, credit score now hovers around 700 (up from 550 in Jan 2018) so it's ""new"" credit.  I purchased a 2012 Hyundai Sonata in January 2018 under pressure, resulting in a interest rate of 16%.  I've been working VERY hard on building my credit this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Income: $720 a week after taxes/healthcare etc...

Rent: $700

Phone: $145

~~Cable~~/Internet: $76 (Just internet - MUST HAVE)

Car payment: $300 (60 month term w/ 16% interest) $10,566 principal.  Value - KBB - 8k. (Never missed a payment)

Credit Card: $500 max limit.. I keep it almost maxed (I'll put 200 down and then buy something.. bad habit).  $25 a month payment.

School Loans: 4 loans totaling $15,383 with 6.8% interest on all of them.  (out of default this month - Monthly payment is $190)

Savings: $1000

Investments: 0

Credit Karma: TransUnion - 694 (down 10pts for school loans) and Equifax - 687 (down 5pts)

FICO: 609

&amp;#x200B;

I am uncertain on what to focus on first.  I want to start saving up to 15k for a house and I need a bigger savings.  I want to refinance my car but I need to put a few grand down because the value of the car is about 8k.  My decent credit is ""new"" and I took quite a few dings early last year with my car (credit checks).  My student loans JUST got out of default this month and put back on my credit so that knocked it down 10 points.

personalfinance,Looking for financial planning tools,"College junior here, in kind of a quarter life crisis. I recently dropped pre-med because it's been a soul-sucking endeavor and if I'm fed up with school 3 years in, I sure as heck am not gonna make it through med school. I also realized I was mostly in it for the prospect of money, and I don't actually need a doctor's salary to live comfortably. All my life I've lived a basic middle class lifestyle, and that can be achieved with less.

However, I am of the belief that you need more money than you ""need"" to get by. As the oldest of 4 in a family that makes less than $100k on a single income, things are very tight. I like the quality of things we have, like I don't need a luxury car or 20 new suits or a giant flatscreen, but I *would* like to be able to fix things *when* they break, and not cross my fingers and hop everything will be okay because I can't afford it. We've had car transmissions blow out (2 different cars now actually) and we can't afford to fix them or buy new ones, so transportation is a pain. We don't even have central air conditioning or heat upstairs, and we're not allowed to run our window units during the day to cut back on electricity costs. As a full time college student paying for school out of pocket, you'd think my finances would be worse than my parents. Nope. I have had to lend them a total of around $2000 now (it's been mostly paid back over a looong interval, but still). 

Point is, I don't need to make a ton, but I would like to make enough to live comfortably in the lifestyle that I'm already used to- basically same tier of house/car/misc items, but without the problems that my family had. Are there any comprehensive tools I can use to figure out a good ballpark estimate of what salary I need to shoot for? I need to start making serious career decisions soon and would like to know what to look for. Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Is getting a small personal loan to pay some expenses and get me through the next month a terrible idea?,"Ok, a bit of backstory here. I am a 25 year old male, no kids, no mortgage. 

I graduated college in 2016 and from then until May 2018 I was working freelance as a cameraman. Things were ok, so good months and more often than not, some bad ones. Back in January I decided to start actively looking for a full time position in the same role.

I interviewed for a few places and wasn't having any luck as not many places hire just camera people, they usually want you to edit and wear multiple hats etc. The day after I got rejected from a job I really wanted, I got a message out of the blue from one of the companies I have done some work for in the past. The boss straight up just asked me if I would be interested in a full time job. I was delighted, they were a good company, young and ambitious. 

I met with them a few days later and had a somewhat informal interview, outlining the position and the role etc. All seemed to be perfect, until it wasn't. At the end of our conversation the boss told me about one of their company policies. That all new hires we placed on an internship program for a period of 3-6 months. It was a paid internship, but he didn't give any figures at this time. I was pretty dejected and had to think about it. They said they had a few more people to talk to and would be in touch soon.

I calculated that with the savings I had and if I lived frugally I could maybe make it work. It would be tough, but possible. I considered the pros and cons and decided if they offered it to me I would take it, depending on how long the internship would last, if it was 3 months then yes I would take it, if it was any more I would have to really take my time with the decision.

Fast forward to the next day and I get a call from from the boss and I was told that they would be willing to hire me on an internship period of 4 months and that the pay would be 1000 a month. I had a quick think on the phone and whilst it was longer than the 3 months I had hoped for, my gut told me to do it. So i accepted.

I joined the company in mid May and have really enjoyed it for the most part. It was a big change for me going from freelance to working essentially a 9-5 (most days anyways)

The trouble begins when it is time to start talking about my full time contract. I knew I was going to be offered a full time position as everything had gone really well up to that point. Last month I sat down with the bosses and we discussed salary etc. After a bit of back and forth over the next few days we settled on a number. 

The problem now has arisen because I stupidly miscalculated when i would be getting my first full pay day. I somehow had it in my head that it would be last month, but of course it is this month. It was a 4 month program, so I would be paid 4 times at that rate and the next would be the full one. I should have known better. The problem is that I had committed myself to some new expenses from last month as I thought I would be able to cover it with my new salary. Of course when I realised that wouldn't be happening until the following month I knew I would have a problem.

Basically my total expenses at this point come to about 1100 a month, not including food. So last month I opened an overdraft on my bank account to the amount of 500, silly mistake number one. At this point, with 5 days left to pay day my bank account it sitting at -500. Which means whilst I will be getting roughly 1700 salary into my account on Wednesday, that will immediately go down to about 1200. Of which about 1100 is already budgeted for.

To make matter worse, I was contacted by my accountant and he told me that I owed 500 in taxes for the 2017 fiscal year from ym freelance days. That is due on October 31st. So now I am really up shit creek.

I could go to family, but I don't really want to as they have helped me lots in the past. That would be my last resort. I would much rather do this on my own.

What are my options?

So here is my situation currently:
 - Bank account sitting at -500 currently
 - 500 in taxes owed on 31st of October
 - 1700 incoming on 31st October

I am considering getting a small personal loan of 1500 from my bank, to be paid back over a 1 year period. The interest rate is 8.65 %, which equates to 130.48 a month. The total cost of the loan is 65.76, which seems reasonable to me.

I figure this amount will cover the overdraft in the account of 500, along with the tax bill of 500 and will leave me with enough to live on for the next month, until my next payday. Then from next payday I will start paying it back in small amounts.

Is this a terrible idea?

personalfinance,"Taking on a loan to do an MBA, before paying of undergraduate student debt.","A little bit of background

* I finished school when I was 23 at University of Toronto. Currently 32,000CAD in debt to Canada
* I moved to work in Hong Kong - live on around 1,000-1,200CAD disposable income/month
* Want to do a part-time MBA in Hong Kong (at HKU), which can cost up to 70,000-80,000CAD

I have 2 options:

1) Hong Kong lets foreign residents apply for a student loan from the government after residing in Hong Kong for 3 years (2 more to go before I'm eligible). Option 1 is for me to wait for 2 more years and then apply for the student loan (which has a lower interest rate - 1.2% Annual and has a payment grace period of 6 months after graduation).

&amp;#x200B;

2) I can apply for a line of credit for the full amount of my education (not a student loan) with a bank like HSBC or Citibank to finance my MBA right away. Interest rate  would be around 3.28% Annual; monthly payments would be around 1,200CAD I would imagine I would have to start paying right away.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, Option 1 lets me get a student loan with lower interest but I need to wait 2 more years before I can even apply for the MBA.

Option 2 - opening up a credit line with a bank, despite having a higher interest, will allow me to get my MBA right away, which would arguably help me get fast tracked into a higher paying job, negating the effects of the higher interest rate.

Would appreciate thoughts from people who've been in similar situations.

personalfinance,Bad credit. Bought a car for 22% APR,"Hi all. Long story short, i am in my late 20’s and recently got out of school and have a great job. I have suffered from mental illness since I was young and only got diagnosed and began treatment ~2 years ago. However, the damage had already been done. Due to my condition I drove my credit to the ground by making stupid decisions. I am now aware and in control of my actions and take steps to avoid falling into the same situation that drove me to where I am right now. 
I racked up credit debt with no way to pay it off since I was in school. I had no choice but to fall into more deep depression while My debt went into default and collection agencies and the whole deal. Blocked the creditors calls and ignored the whole situation. 
I have graduated and I am now making 200k/year. I have a score of 510 and want to improve my score and get my life back on track.
I wanted to start with a car loan since I needed anew car anyway. I knew I wasn’t going to get good financing offers because of my credit score. 
I went to a dealership a day ago and they offered me 22% APR on a 40K new car with 6K down. $980 payment over 72 months. They said “it am in a bad situation, no one will give me a better offer because of my credit score so I should take the deal or leave it” I am desperate so.... I took it. 
(I have been beating myself up over this lately) 
Anyway, it was late around 9pm and they gave me the keys and I traded in my car on the spot.
40hrs later I’m here writing this.
I have the car however I have to deliver the down payment check this afternoon. 
I have done some research after the fact and know that I was ripped off and can get a better deal elsewhere. 
Car had 300 miles and I have added 70 miles on it so far.
I need advice: 
1.	Is there anyway I can return the car/get better terms since I haven’t paid down payment? 
2.	With my situation, What’s the best interest rate I can get on a new car?
3.	what are my alternative options? 

Thanks in advance!

Edit: I might have forgotten to point out that I already paid off my outstanding debt. 

I’m single, have a low rent apartment and have no time to splurge since I’m currently working on my career. 

I can afford the car, I just wanna know if I can get a better rate.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrencies are slightly positive this morning as European mining giant Bitfury considers IPO,"### Crypto News

* A new upgrade, expected to be activated on the Zcash (ZEC)  blockchain on October 29th, 2018, adds significant usability to Zcash’s  protocol by reducing the size of private transactions. The upgrade,  called Sapling, is a hardfork that has been in development since Zcash  launched in 2016. Speaking about Sapling, Nathan Wilcox, CTO of the  Zcash Company, said, “The Sapling protocol will allow shielded transfers  to be completed with about 100 times less memory and probably six or  more times faster.” Currently, shielded transactions on Zcash are only  possible for users that run a full node -- the Sapling upgrade should  enable shielded transactions for anyone using Zcash.
* A research report conducted by Recorded Future, a US-based security  firm, finds that the North Korean government has sponsored at least two  scam cryptocurrencies so far in 2018. Titled, ""Shifting Patterns in  Internet Use Reveal Adaptable and Innovative North Korean Ruling Elite,”  the report details that the first scam coin backed by the North Korean  government is Interstellar Coin, founded by Insikt Group in 2018 --  since being established, the coin has gone by a number of names,  including HOLD, HUZU, and Stellar. The second scam coin backed by North  Korea is called Marine Chain coin and it was originally identified on  multiple Bitcoin forums in August 2018 -- the scam coin claim to enable  the tokenization of maritime vessels for multiple users and owners.
* Bloomberg reports that Bitfury, a large European cryptocurrency  miner manufacturer, is considering an initial public offering (IPO) as  one of a few different options to raise funding -- Bitfury is also  considering raising debt or selling a minority stake in the company,  according to Bloomberg. Bloomberg’s sources detail that Bitfury could  IPO with a valuation between USD$3 billion and USD$5 billion, however,  the report specifies that these valuations are, “early estimates and  could change depending on markets and the industry.” The firm is  reportedly considering listing its IPO on exchanges in Amsterdam,  London, or Hong Kong.
* Mastercard, the US multinational financial services corporation,  believes that cryptocurrencies could benefit from applying some  principles of fractional reserve banking, according to a new patent  application made public on Thursday. The patent application, submitted  through the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO), outlines plans to  allow merchants to interact with “blockchain currencies” through a new  method of simultaneous cryptocurrency and fiat-currency storage. The  patent details, “The use of traditional payment networks and payment  systems technologies in combination with blockchain currencies may  provide consumers and merchants the benefits of the decentralized  blockchain while maintaining security of account information and provide  a strong defense against fraud and theft.”
* The Shenzen Court of International Arbitration published a case  analysis on Thursday that contains a ruling involving a recent dispute  related to the possession and transfer of cryptocurrency assets. Despite  China’s ban on cryptocurrency trading, the arbitration body found that  Bitcoin should still be legally protected as property with economic  values. The case with the ruling involved a plaintiff who signed an  agreement for the defendant to manage a pool of cryptocurrencies on  behalf of the plaintiff until a certain period in time -- upon reaching  that period in time, the defendant refused to return the cryptocurrency  assets. The cryptocurrencies in question were 20 Bitcoin (BTC), 50  Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and 13 Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), worth a combined  USD$493,158.
* The Supreme Court of India has formally requested that the Indian  government provide an opinion on cryptocurrencies after the country’s  central bank banned domestic banks from providing services to  cryptocurrency firms. The Supreme Court of India made this request on  Thursday after the court heard multiple petitions submitted by local  cryptocurrency exchanges and the Internet &amp; Mobile Association of  India concerning the Reserve Bank of India’s ban. Nakul Dewan, the legal  representative for nine different cryptocurrency exchanges involved in  the hearing, was quoted saying, “The government must give some finality  to the issue. We have got employees. There are jobs.” The Supreme Court  of India will revisit the matters on November 20th, 2018.
* While speaking at the India Mobile Congress 2018 event, Ajjt Pai,  chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said that the  US should not “disadvantage” emerging technologies such as blockchain  due to “antiquated” regulations -- Pai went on to call for a  conversation between tech giants like Facebook and Google regarding data  privacy and blockchain’s potential applications. Pai went on to  comment, “We don’t have jurisdiction over these firms but that’s one of  the things we are trying to learn about. What are the emerging  technologies that will have an effect on this space and how should our  thinking about regulation evolve?”

personalfinance,What is the difference between APR and an Interest Rate?,"Ok so as the title suggest I am wondering what the difference between the two APY and Interest Rate (IR) is?

For some back round I was listening to a financial podcast and the Gentleman said to try to find a savings account were you get 2% interest. After that he said something along the lines of if its not don't even bother. I looked at my back and they do both .25% on both APY and IR. I then googled what banks have the highest interest rate for a savings account and Ally bank come up at 1.90% APY. If someone could explain this in the simplest terms possible that would be great.

My question is, with my 401k contributions, my medical savings tax savings... am I paying too little federal?

I claim 1 exemption (single, one job, live alone, no children, not taking care of any family financially, no side-income).

Someone said I need to change this to 0 exemptions, some say I need to start paying extra taxes every paycheck... but can't answer on how much.

How bad am I going to get screwed over this tax year? Will investing more in 401k take me down in my tax bracket? I don't like owing money to the government...

personalfinance,Recent (married) college grad needing help financial planning.,"Obligatory “Long time lurker first time poster”

So my wife and I (23/21) are actually graduating from college with our bachelors degrees this December and this has thrown me into a huge rabbit hole of questions about how to start our financial life on the right foot. Here is where we stand currently: 

Graduating with about $55K in debt combined, about $18k subsidized and the rest un-subsidized federal loans. Average 5.3% interest rate

Only about $3K in savings, zero investments as of now, and basically zero credit card payments / car payments. 

I have a job offer in Portland for $70K per year ($5000 relo and $5000 sign on bonus) and assuming she at least gets a minimum wage job (worst case scenario and unlikely) that should bring our yearly income up to $92k per year. 

With such a huge increase in income, in terrified of making wrong investment/savings decisions. Any advice? I fully plan on contributing to my 401K up to my match (6% .5 on the dollar) and I would like to max out my Roth IRA as well. But should we be maxing two Roth IRAs? One for her and one for me? Or is one sufficient? 

Also how should we tackle our loans? Is aggressively paying them down worth it or is it better to focus on maxing 401K / filling up a 6 month reserve savings acc and make lower payments.. would refinancing be a smart thing to do on the loans? 

I feel super incompetent, but thank you in advance for any help and advice.",finance
btc,"""Any project needs a long term vision based off an analysis. Otherwise you just become reactive tweaking things here and there, averse to risk while the world passes you by. The market changes and you disappear into irrelevance. Crypto has experienced massive evolution since 2010."" -Amir Taaki","That quote almost perfectly summarizes why I love, support &amp; believe in Bitcoin (BCH) **more than any other crypto currency**.

It also summarizes why I despise Bitcoin Core and consider it to be nothing more than a deceptive project that is co-opting the Bitcoin name and advancing itself based on the momentum it has taken from a design &amp; *long term vision* that actually works. BTC's current design is **not** what got it to where it is today; it's an inellegant, inpractical monster. BTC got where it is today by starting out on the Bitcoin design: a design which was elegant, practical and quite frankly: genius. 

As if that quote by Amir isn't perfect enough on its own, guess who is the very first person to responded to it and guess what they said...

&amp;#x200B;

**Adam Back:** ""*so what should be different about the software.*""

&amp;#x200B;

In saying that, Adam could not have more perfectly demonstrated his lack of understanding of what Bitcoin is, if he had spent a week trying. He'll probably never in his life be able to see and comprehend the genius of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin isn't just a software codebase and a corresponding set of developers that maintain it and add to it.

Bitcoin encompasses a social and economic *long term vision* which has been known to its early supporters and encoded in the writings of the project founder: Satoshi.

Some parts of that vision which are foundational to what Bitcoin is:

* Economically:

  * An attempt to create **sound money** (look up what that word means if you don't know)

  * A price deflationary monetary system. In this system, wealth is preserved, economically rational savers are rewarded and aggressive, monopolising banking parasites are not fed as they cannot easily debase the money supply.

  * A fixed, known and verifiable coin supply.

* Socially: 

  * An attempt to take the powers of monetary and economic manipulation away from fallible, self-interested men. IE take that power away from governments / central banks.

  * A successful, peaceful &amp; survivable **defiance** of the state. Look into what governments have done to people that have tried to make alternative currencies (e.g. the Liberty Dollar). It's the same every time. If you try and compete with their own fiat-currency shitcoins, they will violently shut you down, and probably lock you up.

  * A fair distribution of the coins based on the **work** you put in.

  * Fairness in the economy in general. The bailouts following 2008 (referenced in, no-less than the [Bitcoin genesis block itself](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/0)), are an iconic example of unfairness. The banks being bailed out almost certainly got to where they were via cronyism (unfair, special favours/advantages from the state) and then despite that huge advantage they still failed and the state/central-banks in some of the largest acts of unfairness the world has ever seen, bailed out these corporations to the tune of trillions of dollars.

* Technologically:

  * A trust-less system.

  * A [peer-to-peer, electronic cash system](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) that is fast, cheap, reliable, easy &amp; practical for usage by ordinary people.

  * A human-level micro-payments system. In support of the Bitcoin design, Satoshi wrote: ""[conventional currency] massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible"". [source](https://nakamotostudies.org/forums/bitcoin-open-source-implementation-of-p2p-currency/)

personalfinance,Refinancing car with negative equity,"I made the (somewhat stupid) decision to buy a car two years ago.
Car was worth about 18.5k USD. Ended up with a loan of 29k due to negative equity in the previous loan. I've done pretty decent at paying it off but I'm looking to refinance.

Unfortunately, the car has depreciated to around $13k and I still owe just shy of 21k on it. I have about 5 years left on the loan, at about a 5.7% interest rate.

Understandably, I'm having a hard time finding a bank that will let me refinance. My credit is decent, averaging between 690-730. I don't have much of a down, cause of my larger current payment. I'm attempting to reduce my payment a little (I'm at $418/mo) so I can start saving and paying extra on the car.

personalfinance,How to Buy a New Car,"Let's face it: for most people, car buying sucks. Walking into a car dealership can be an absolutely dreadful, terrifying experience. And for good reason. Many people have car dealer horror stories they're ready and willing to share, and no one ever talks about the good experiences they've had at car dealerships. Well, let's change that.


Below is a fairly extensive guide on how to buy a new car. If you're a seasoned pro, some of it might seem pretty basic. But if you're a first time buyer who is completely bewildered, hopefully this will shed some light on the process and how you should go about it the first time.


Oh, and yes, we could fight all day about buying new vs. used, but the fact is that someone out there IS buying new cars, so hopefully this helps them.


**1. Determine Your Budget**


Before you start salivating over that Lexus SUV, you need to make sure you can actually afford it. If you aren't paying for the car in cash, just figure out how much you're comfortable parting with each month, as well as how much cash you have to put down for a down payment. And then, if you have a trade-in, you'll need to determine how much you'll likely receive for it.


The monthly payment and down payment are fairly straightforward. No matter what you decide, once you determine these numbers, you need to stick to them. So if you figure out that your maximum monthly payment is $300/month and you have $1,000 to use as a down payment, that's what you have and it's not going to change. It's also highly recommended that you take out nothing longer than a 5 year loan on a car, despite dealers offering 6 or even 7 year terms nowadays.


If you have a vehicle to trade, you'll have to figure out how much you think you'll be able to get for it, assuming you're selling it to the dealer. There are a few online tools that can give you an idea about what your car is worth: 


- [KBB](https://www.kbb.com/whats-my-car-worth/?ico=kbbvalue)


- [Edmunds](https://www.edmunds.com/appraisal/)


- [Cars.com](https://www.cars.com/sell/book-value/)


Just keep in mind that these tools are guides. You definitely aren't going to get the maximum trade-in value at a dealer, so it's best to look at the lowest average number and assume that you're not going to be offered anything more than that for your car. Anything higher will be a nice bonus.


So now you know the monthly payment you're comfortable with, as well as how much you have to put down and the minimum amount you'll accept for your trade. With this information, it's time to determine the maximum amount of money you can afford to pay for a car. Here's a good tool to use for that:


- [Carmax Calculator](https://www.carmax.com/car-financing/car-payment-calculator)


You'll notice the interest rate part of the calculator. This rate fluctuates, and will depend a lot on your credit score, what the dealership is currently offering, the market right now, etc. For now, using an average interest rate (3-5%) will be fine for determining the total price of the car you can afford. Despite what that calculator says, you don't need ""excellent"" credit to qualify for the rate they're saying is excellent.


In addition to the price of the car, you have to add on tax, title, and licensing fees, which will vary by state. That's built into the calculator, too. As you can see, it can have a pretty significant effect on the price of your car, sometimes adding 10% or more to the cost. The best thing to do is play around with the price of the car until you can find something that works best for you. Once you know this exact number, you're ready to actually look at cars.


**2. Narrow Down Your Choices**


If you remember nothing else, remember this: the easiest way to get screwed by a dealer is by not knowing exactly what you want. This sounds so simple, but you'd be surprised at the sheer number of people who walk onto a lot and let a salesman sell a car to them. So before you ever step foot into a dealership, you need to know the year, make, and model of the car you want, at the very least. Beyond that, it also really helps to know the trim level, options, and color. If you can find the exact car you want, this will make things a lot easier.


The easiest way to do this is just play around on the internet. Go to different car sites and ""build"" your ideal car. Since you already determined exactly what you can afford, you won't waste time looking at cars you won't be buying. The MSRP you see will be more than what you'll ultimately pay for the car, and you can ""build"" cars with the invoice price in mind (see step 4). The goal at this step is to narrow down your choices to 2 or 3 vehicles that you can test drive.


**3. Take Some Test Drives**


Now for the fun part! You are going to test drive the different cars that you've decided might work. You will not be buying anything yet, so there shouldn't be any pressure. You can confidently walk onto a car lot, ask any salesman you see to look at a specific car, and take it for a ride. If you can find one with the exact trim level, options, and even color that you're interested in, even better.


While you're on the drive, make sure you pay attention to everything. This is going to be your car for the next few years, so you should absolutely love it. Make sure you're comfortable with the way it handles and accelerates, how visible things are to you, and whether it makes any weird noises or feels strange. Test the a/c, and turn on/off the radio at different speeds and on different roads, if you can. Overall, you should be having fun (because it IS fun), but you should know by the end of the ride whether this car is still a contender.


Once you're finished, you leave. Short of the dealership literally giving you the car for free, there's nothing that they can say that will keep you there because you are not yet ready to buy. You won't be working with that specific salesman again, either. Don't let them make you feel bad about not buying immediately or worry about wasting their time. This is a huge purchase. For most people, it's the 2nd most expensive thing they'll ever buy. Those reasons alone are good enough to justify a free hour deciding whether you're going to buy their car.


If you can test drive your options one right after another, it will really help you figure out which one works best for you.


**4. Determine the Best Price to Pay for Your Car**


Once you figure out which car you want, it's time to determine exactly what you're going to pay for it. No, the dealer doesn't set the price, the sticker price is absolutely NOT set in stone, the dealer always has some wiggle room on a car, and you will NEVER cost them any money. Ever. A car dealership will never lose money on a car sale (Ok they might, but it's too complicated to explain why here. They won't in your case and or any of your friends' cases, either).


First, know that you won't be negotiating the price of the new car. Not really, anyway. The only thing you'll be doing is accepting or rejecting offers. Negotiating implies that you're giving something up in order to get something from a dealer. Don't play that game. An individual car dealership needs you a LOT more than you need them, so treat them accordingly. You hold all of the power and can simply stop responding to emails if you don't get what you want. They rely on you to make a living.


Next, the sticker price of the car means absolutely nothing to you. It's completely irrelevant. Might as well be $1,000,000, as far as you're concerned. The price you care about is the invoice, which is the price that the dealer paid for the car. You are going to be ""negotiating"" based off of the invoice. If a dealer ""knocks $1,000 off MSRP"" and calls it a deal, it's not a deal. They're adding thousands to the price they paid and making a profit. Keep that in mind.


So to determine what the dealer paid for the car, we're going to be using another tool:


- [Edmunds TMV](https://www.edmunds.com/tmv.html)


Using the TMV calculator, you can price the exact car you want, including trim level, color, options, etc. For fun, you can see the invoice vs. MSRP of each option to see how much the dealer would be making on each item if you just paid sticker price for the car. But ultimately, you are looking for the invoice total of the exact car you want.


The base price, plus any options you've added, will give you the invoice total. For the record, it really is the real invoice price of the car.


A couple of things to keep in mind here. You'll notice something called a destination fee, which can be almost $1,000. This is almost never negotiable, so you might as well just assume that it's not going anywhere. It's how the dealer got the car from the manufacturer, and they're generally unwilling to budge on it since they did pay it and it's part of the invoice. Also, the TMV calculator shows you what they call the true market value of the car. While it's nice that they offer that, it's pretty meaningless to you. You care only about the invoice price. You are going to try to get as close to (or even under) the invoice price of the car.


(For those wondering, I know about dealer holdback. I explain at the bottom.)


**5. Obtain Financing**


That's right. You're going to walk into a dealership with your financing ready to go. If they can beat it (they usually can), go with the dealer. There's zero downside to getting a better rate and paying a dealer vs a bank. But getting another offer is only going to make you more confident and know the worst rate that you'll have to pay.


The best way to do this is to go to your bank/credit union or even contact several online. They'll want to know the make, model, etc. of the car you're buying, and they'll basically pre-approve you for the full amount at a certain interest rate. You can shop around as much as you'd like to get the best rate. Just know that this is sort of an insurance policy against the dealer trying to screw you over. They can generally beat anything you can get on your own because they do hundreds of transactions each month and already have preferred relationships with banks.


When you do go to the dealer, you'll have a check for the total price of the car. It will likely be much higher than the amount you'll pay, but that's because they base it off of the sticker price, not the negotiated rate. If you do end up going with your bank's financing, you'll just make your payments to them instead of the dealer.


**6. Contact Dealerships**


Now for the really fun part. It's time to contact dealerships and let them fight over you. The absolute best way to do this is to email the Internet Sales Manager at the dealership. You can do that by filling out the dealer's online form or just calling the dealership and asking for the Internet Sales Manager and then asking him for his email address. No, you don't have time to talk on the phone and you absolutely cannot come in to talk in person right now. But you can email.


If you live in a medium-size city, you probably have dozens of dealerships within an hour of you. If you want the best price for your car, you should be contacting everyone that sells the car you want. There is no difference between the cars, after all, and a one time purchase doesn't mean you ever have to go there again. So what do you actually say in your email to this Internet Sales Manager?


Hi XXX,


I'm interested in purchasing a (Color, Year, Make, Model, Trim) with the (exact package, options, etc.). Can you tell me what your absolute best drive-out price (including tax, title, and license) would be for this car?


If you have one in stock or can get one immediately, I would be able to come in to buy it today.


Thank you,


XXX


And then just wait for the emails to pour in. Internet Sales Managers deal in volume. They get bonuses based on the number of cars they sell each month, so they don't care as much about making a killing on each deal. They know the score - you're an educated, sophisticated, ready, and able car buyer and don't have time for games. And if they can move another vehicle with minimal effort, they're happy.


What you do once you get the emails back is up to you. Sometimes you luck out and get an offer for $200 over invoice right away. Other times, you might want to play the dealers against each other. You might get a decent offer and a bad one. You can email the bad one and tell them that X dealer offered X price. Whatever you do, once you decide that you like the price, it's time to head to the dealer and buy the car. You can email the winner and set an appointment to meet.


Also, they may not have your exact car in stock, but they might be able to trade or obtain it from another dealer. This is completely normal and usually doesn't take very long. It should not affect your purchase price at all and you will absolutely not pay for any transfer. If they don't have your exact car, and can't trade for it or it's very difficult to find, you MIGHT want to adjust what you're looking for. Just go through the invoice pricing steps again with the new options priced out.


**7. Visit Dealership to Purchase Car**


Once you go to the dealership, you can walk directly up to a salesman and confidently say that you have an appointment with the Internet Sales Manager. You'll meet with him and he'll show you the car. It will usually feel very un-salesmanlike. He knows that you know exactly what you want, so unless you have any specific questions or last minute concerns, he's just showing you the car that he knows you're going to buy. You should still take it for a test drive, just to be sure there's nothing wrong with that specific car and to confirm one last time that yes, this is what you want. If that's the case, tell him that you're ready to buy.


The Internet Sales Manager will take you to his office and show you the price that you agreed to for that exact car. If it's not EXACTLY what you negotiated, you walk. No dealership worth your time will pull any stunts like that, so you should expect to see the exact price you agreed to over email.


Now it's time to hit him with your trade if you have one. Why wait until now? Because the trade price and sales price of the car are completely unrelated. Think of them as two separate transactions, not one big one. So tell him you have a car to trade, and he'll either go inspect it himself or have the Used Car Sales Manager appraise it. Depending on how busy they are, it shouldn't take very long.


Once you get an offer for your trade, you have a decision to make. You can either accept it outright, counter, or walk away (Pro Tip: You can ALWAYS walk away). No matter what it is, you should counter with something. Worst case scenario: they say no. They probably won't, though. They may hem and haw, but they really want to do a car deal and don't want to piss you off too much. So as long as you're not unreasonable, they'll probably do something. I usually counter like this:


""I really want to buy this car, but I can't do it with that offer of $3,000 for my trade. It's just too low. I might be able to make it work if the offer were a little bit more in line with what I think the market is, which is $4,000."" And then just wait. He may go talk to another manager, get approval, etc. He'll probably come back at $250-$500 more than what the original offer was. If this works for you, take it. If not, you can keep negotiating based on your comfort level. Just know that you're probably never going to get exactly what you want for your car.


The biggest thing to keep in mind with your trade is knowing the minimum price you're willing to accept without being emotional. You might be insulted that your ""baby"" is only worth $1,000, but you do have to be realistic. If you absolutely hate their offer and can't come to an agreement, you can always try to sell the car on your own if you want to deal with the time and hassle. You may get more, but it may not be worth your time.


Finally though, once you're finished with everything, you're ready to buy the car. The Internet Sales Manager may have you sign a sheet of paper with the price listed, maybe monthly payments, etc. It's not binding at all and the interest rate they put on that paper is meaningless. You care about one price: the total price, including tax, title, and license, which will be the biggest price listed (minus your trade, assuming you have one). That's the price you agreed to over email, and that's what you're going to pay. By the way, this sheet of paper you'll sign is a mind game to get you to believe that you cannot walk away now because you've ""bought"" the car. You haven't bought anything yet and you can still walk. 


And then once you sign that paper, there's just one more thing to do...


**8. Buy the Car**


Wait, you're done, right? You signed the paper and bought the car. YOU SAID WE WERE DONE.


Wrong. Oh, you are so wrong. Once people ""buy"" their car, they relax. The salesman is gone and now it's time to fill out some paperwork, dot some j's and cross some x's, and drive off in your brand new ride. Right? Nope. Everything before now was a game.


Finance is a war.


The finance department (sometimes called finance and insurance or F&amp;I), despite seeming like a place where you simply fill out some paperwork, is where a dealership makes its real money. The finance salesmen are usually the best salesmen in the dealership. They are not there to help finish the paperwork required to get you your car. Any high school kid could do that. The finance salesmen are there to get you to pay more for the car you just bought, typically through fear.


A car salesman has a tough living and I won't blame them for trying to make money. But a finance salesman is a professional shark. Oh, they may seem nice at first. They're usually older guys with a few ice-breakers that they've honed over the years to get you to relax even more. ""Congratulations!"", they'll say with a smile. ""Relax, the hard part's over!""


False. This man wants all of your money.


Here are some fun things you'll be offered:


- Extended Warranty


- Maintenance Plans (Oil changes, Scheduled Maintenance, etc.)


- Gap Insurance


- Anti-Theft Products (Lojack, VIN Etching, etc.)


- Road Hazard Assistance (aka AAA)


- Wheel Warranties


- Fabric Protection (Scotchgard)


The finance salesman will use EVERY. SINGLE. TACTIC. IMAGINABLE. to get you to buy these products. He'll scare you into thinking you're going to get into an accident as you drive off the lot, total your car, and owe $4,000 more than it's worth. Or he'll try to convince you that the reliable, quality car you just bought is really garbage after 60k miles, so you need that extended warranty. Or he'll remind you about kids spilling things all over your new seats or people carjacking your car. Hasn't happened to you yet, you say? Well, consider yourself one of the lucky ones. (It's actually pretty interesting to know all of this going in and see it in action. Treat it like a show - you're watching a professional salesman do his absolute best, and it can be fascinating).
 

These products are just like the cars: they have an invoice/MSRP, and you're going to be offered the sticker price on each one. Are they negotiable? Absolutely. Are they something you should buy? That's debatable. Did you research each of the products before walking into that office? Do you even need gap insurance if you put enough down and got a good enough price? Can you buy a can of Scotchgard on your way home from the dealer?


Anything you accept is going to affect the price of the car (obviously), but you already decided what you were going to pay back in step 1. Do you really want to adjust that price after all this work? And besides negotiating blindly, which is a terrible idea, you're going toe to toe with a legitimate salesman. No offense, but you probably just don't have what it takes.


My advice? The word of the day in the finance office is: **NO**. No, you do not want an extended warranty. No, you don't need a maintenance plan, Lojack, wheel warranties, gap insurance, or anything else they're pitching. No, just the car, please. He will pretend to be upset. Possibly even angry. He's an older guy who knows better, and you're just some dumb kid buying a car. You should really take his advice. But ok, don't say he didn't warn you.


Nope. Just the car.


Once you decline everything, you'll get a finance rate offer. This will hopefully be better than the financing you were able to secure on your own. If it is, go with it.

**IF YOU ARE GOING TO WALK AWAY, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE**


Finally, you'll sign everything agreeing to your monthly payment, total finance price, rate, declined options, etc. Once you sign this document and drive off the lot, that car is yours.


And that's it! You'll get your brand new car for a fair price and you won't wonder if you got totally screwed over. Once you get out of the finance office, you can breathe, hug your friend, do a dance, and even smile. You are no longer on the defensive and can even joke around with the salesman. You'll find that everyone is in a decent mood, even the shark in the finance office (he'll vow to get the next sucker).

Enjoy your new car!!


**Bonus Tips:**


- While this guide works best for new cars, you can use the same strategy for used. Just keep in mind that there are no apples to apples comparisons, so it's much more difficult to determine the price you should be paying for a used car. And it's tougher to get a dealer to email you their best price on a used car. Plus, there's no telling what the real condition will be of that car until you see it in person.


- Car dealerships are typically slammed on Saturdays. If it's at all possible for you, the best time to visit is during the day on a weekday. The absolute worst time is a holiday weekend, like 4th of July and President's Day. SALES!! SALES!! SALES!! (You got a better deal anyway)


- Even if you do everything here, car dealerships can still be scary for some people, especially first time buyers. If you're not comfortable, take someone with you, especially when you go to buy. Just having someone else there might keep you calm, especially in the finance office.


- Unfortunately, dealerships can absolutely be racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic, etc. If you're a woman, they may talk down to you. If you're young or a minority, they might treat you like you can't afford to buy a car. If you run into a dealership like this, just refuse to work with them. There's no excuse for that crap in 2018. And the best dealers won't care who you are, they just want to sell you a car.


- You'll notice that I talked about monthly payments, but only for your benefit. Yes, you need to know what you're paying each month since that's how most people budget, but you absolutely do NOT need to discuss this number with the salesman. The only number you are concerned with is the total price of the car you are buying. You can see your monthly payment (which you should already know) once you get your interest rate in finance. Even google has a simple calculator (monthly payment x interest rate x # of months) to make sure that you're not being screwed over. You can even pull it out while you're sitting in the office and double check all of the numbers. The only thing you'll be doing is confirming that yes, that's the monthly payment you know you're going to pay based on the interest rate you get in finance, but the overall price of the car you're buying is unaffected.


- Dealer holdback is a thing that will allow a dealer to sell a car at or under invoice and still make a profit. Basically, the dealer gets paid a bonus by the manufacturer after they sell the car. The amount varies by manufacturer, but usually ranges from 1-3% of the MSRP. So, for example, if they sell a car with an MSRP for $20,000 and an invoice of $18,000 for the invoice price, but with a 3% holdback, they don't break even. They make $600 (3% of $20k). You CAN try to negotiate off of this price ($17,400 in that scenario) instead of the invoice price, since this number is technically what the dealer will ultimately pay for the car. Just know that it's harder to get there and not everyone will negotiate that low. Oh, and not everyone has holdback. Here's a link that claims to be accurate as of 10/1/2018, but it's hard to know whether the holdback percentages are correct. Just keep in mind that anything at or near invoice is a good deal on a car. You're not getting screwed at all if you know you're near that price. If you can get anywhere near the holdback price, you're getting an AMAZING deal on a new car: [Dealer Holdback](https://www.autocheatsheet.com/new-car/dealer-holdback.html)


- Car salesmen, especially the finance salesmen, are PROFESSIONAL negotiators. This is what they do for a living. You might buy a car once every 4 or 5 years. A good car salesman can do 15-20 deals a month. The finance guys can do several a day. You are not on their level when it comes to negotiating, no matter what you think of your skills. And your friend who got a ""great deal by really sticking it to the salesman"" probably negotiated $2,000 off MSRP and got absolutely destroyed in finance. You don't screw over a car dealership. You try to get screwed by them as little as possible.

personalfinance,"24 year old, US, with terrible credit score from an unpaid University bill. Trying to get my life back in order","I grew up pretty well off, and I was gifted lots of opportunities. I kind of always naturally expected my parents would put me through school. 

I attended a private college in Florida for a year. I got a scholarship for 26,000. My dad seemed to have had it taken care of and my mom and I never questioned it. 

I ended up transferring back home and going to a public school. Turns out that once I transferred, my father had not been working and we were on the brink of losing out house. My car that I had since my 16th birthday was taken. 
Honestly I was a bit spoiled growing up and I never really understood the value of hard work or even how to budget until that happened. I had a few businesses where I made a couple thousand in the summer but thats it. 

My mom found out about my dad lying to us, and that he really wasnt bringing money in from his job.. etc and immediately applied me for financial aid. 

I moved on and killed it at school, got well paying internships in finance. When I moved to the city, I applied to rent an apartment for 3 months and they needed a credit score check. I assumed my credit score was fine and had no history. 
The apartment immediatly rejected me. I looked on credit karma and got so sad. My dad never paid for my freshman year and I had a collections acount of $21,239. I was honestly beyond pissed off, my dad low key effed the possibilities for me to get an apartment etc out of college. 

I graduated, and took a year off because I was depressed and had health issues. I didn't work. 
I am now feeling better and will be applying for jobs soon. I am just worried about my credit score. Will it affect employment for me? 

I have $15,242	worth of student loans and I have been making my payments with my savings from last year so they are in good standing.

Here's  a few things that I suggest you do as the price goes nowhere, everybody loses interest and you're left on your own with your magic internet money. Don't hesitate to comment and add more material, I'm sure there's stuff missing here :

&amp;#x200B;

1. Take the time to [learn how to set up a full node](https://hackernoon.com/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-installing-a-bitcoin-full-node-on-linux-2018-edition-cb8e384479ea) and [run your transactions through that full node](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server) . If you're a bit more adventurous, here's a [config generator](https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/) to get your node running as you like it and here's some help on [setting up a Tor hidden service](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Setting_up_a_Tor_hidden_service) . 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Take a hard look at your privacy and security. Here's the famous [lopp guide on privacy](https://medium.com/s/story/a-modest-privacy-protection-proposal-5b47631d7f4c) and a less interesting  [primer on storage](https://github.com/JWWeatherman/how_to_store_bitcoin) . If you've not got a hard wallet it's probably a good time to get one, so that you don't have to wait in the queue during the next bull run. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is obviously a vast subject, you will have to review your general computing habits (time to dump Google, switch to Linux if you haven't already, etc) and other security / privacy considerations depending upon your particular situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Take the time to understand some basic economics (of the 'right kind' I might add). Here's a [very good summary](https://medium.com/@YorickdeM/my-133-favorite-quotes-from-the-bitcoin-standard-fbe2147abebe) of The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean and of course, it never hurts to read things put out by the good folks at [Mises.org](https://Mises.org) , [Fee.org](https://Fee.org), etc from time to time. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. If you're one of the activist types, there's many things that you can do to promote Bitcoin, be it commercial, social, philanthropic, political  - but please don't become another Roger Ver in the process - understand what you're trying to promote and challenge your assumptions if Bitcoin doesn't live up to your expectations and evolves into a creature that's very different from what you wanted it to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

5. Last but not the least, earn or buy bitcoin - it's on sale :) But don't forget the old adage - only put as much as you can afford to loose - this is still one hell of an experiment !

I've been getting by with the bare minimum 5,500 in subsidized loans, thankfully I have a pretty good scholarship to cover the rest of my tuition.  As for living expenses, not so much. I have to work \~20-30 hours per week in order to pay for all of that. So, I'm working, taking 15-17 credits per semester, being in clubs to build my resume for a competitive field, and being involved in rigorous high level coursework, all while trying to maintain a good GPA to keep my scholarship.

I've applied for extra scholarships and those haven't been fruitful (I don't demonstrate any financial need, my EFC is huge).  I don't take borrowing money lightly in any sense, but in order for me to finish college without having a stress induced heart attack, I need to take out enough loans to cover my living expenses so that I may stop working. School should be my number one job, and it is definitely not. But with my parents refusing to help or even cosign on a loan, I struggle to find any lender that isn't shady with an interest rate through the roof.

personalfinance,Brand new car delivery delayed by 2 months,"Hello reddit, 


I'm facing a rather dissapointing situation and wanted to see if I was overreacting or how the usual individual would react in my place.

On september 21st 2018, I signed and made the usual 500$ deposit for the purchase of a brand new Subaru WRX 2019. It's my first new car so obivously I was thrilled about the whole adventure which actually went quite well.I got a pretty good deal and the purchase experience went quite smooth at the dealership.

I was told that the delivery would take arround 6 weeks and that it was more likely that it would take less than more time for the delivery. They said that the car was on the boat already and on it's way.

6 weeks from the moment I signed and made the deposit puts us at November 2nd.


I received an update from their end today (October 26th) regarding the delivery time; 


The salesman tells me that there has been change regarding the time delivery. Apparently they could not manage to contact the dealer in British Columbia to get the car from their end (I live in Quebec) so they have to get a new one manufactured which will take an additionnal two months from now.

What the actual fuck?

My problem is that we never ever talked about getting the car from an other dealership. They said the car was on the boat and on it's way. Having to deal with an other dealership to get the car is an entirely different scenario.

Had I been told that there was a risk of not getting that car and having to wait extra time I perhaps would have held off from actually buying it since I could have waited a little longer and could have gotten better deals with lower interest rate instead (Like march or april).

What also pisses me off is that I planned to give my mother the current car I drive since hers is pretty much dying as we speak. Her car also doesnt have winter tires so she's not prepared to drive it for winter (If it manages to survive till then) so I'll need to buy her some winter tires because of that delay.

Having to wait an extra week or two for the transport would have been fine, but the reason why I have to wait now is because they assumed that they could get the car from an other dealer when they actually failed to for some reason (Salesman said they coudnt get a hold off the dealership? What the hell does that mean?)

On the contract i signed it says the following ; 

The car will be delivered at the date established by the two parties or as soon as possible after this date. Although, the dealership is not held responsible for the delay of the delivery resulting of a force majeur, transportation issues or any other event out of control of the dealership.

The discussed delivery date was not written on the contract although the date on the contract for the delivery is september 21st (date i signed and ordered the car).

So i stand here asking what I can do in this situation.

I don't plan on cancelling the contract although I'm trying to find out if I have the arguments to do so in order to bargain and try to get something out of this situation.

It's not a force majeur situation.
It's not a transportaton delay.
Is it a situation that is out of control for the dealership? I'm assuming that it's not.

personalfinance,Any assistance helps,"My mom passed away suddenly 2 weeks ago, losing her I also lost 1/3 of our household income. 

My amex balance is currently 8800 which includes all my costs for the month of October AND funeral costs. I have ~5500 gathered right now (via GoFundMe, venmo, and direct donations).

I'm trying to scrape up the last bit before my bill is due 11/23 (taking out a loan against my retirement account if they approve it +savings).

I have cut all the costs I could think of. Cable, gym, storage unit, etc. My biggest cost is my rent, essentially it is almost half my take home income. To break my lease right at this very moment is 3k... that I don't have. They have mentioned I could do a payment plan. I dont know if they'll report it to my credit or not which makes me hesitant. I am trying to reach out to their corporate office out of state to explain the circumstances to see if I could walk away without paying it but maybe just a 60 day notice instead, I just haven't had much luck getting to the right person. 

A part of me has considered just paying to break the lease and going into CC debt but at the same time I've avoided CC debt at all costs due to interest rates. The other part of me is saying just stay put til the lease is up and live super frugally then move in with a cousin when the lease is up in March to save up 6 months.

investing,The U.S. Secretly Halted JPMorgan’s Growth for Years [Bloomberg],"For almost six years, Washington secretly shackled JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the nation’s biggest bank.

Now the chains are off, thanks to bank-friendly regulators in the Trump administration.

In actions never before made public, Obama administration regulators prevented the bank from opening branches in new states as punishment for violating banking rules, according to people familiar with the matter. JPMorgan’s ambitious plan to expand nationally, announced earlier this year, was made possible by the Trump administration’s rollback of those restraints, which date from 2012, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing regulators’ impact on the bank’s plans.

JPMorgan has racked up more than $30 billion in penalties, legal costs and related obligations since the 2008 financial crisis, some of which stemmed from its acquisitions of Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc. Missteps include excessive risk taken by the London Whale trader and failing to flag transactions related to Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. Privately, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency stopped JPMorgan from expanding into additional states while resolving compliance breakdowns as part of an unwritten regulatory policy, the people said.

Expansion Ban
While banks often have private conversations with regulators and even gauge their reactions to potential plans, the people with knowledge of the matter described the ban as one of the more extreme ways they exerted their control behind the scenes.

Regulators went to even harsher lengths earlier this year to punish Wells Fargo &amp; Co., placing a cap on its assets after a pattern of lapses and abuses. Janet Yellen, who served as Federal Reserve chair under President Barack Obama, announced the unprecedented punishment on her final workday in office.

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, operated 5,130 branches in 23 states at the end of last year. With fresh assurances from regulators under President Donald Trump, the people said, it’s planning to open 400 branches in as many as 20 new markets in the next five years, including plans to build in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. This is the first time the bank is opening branches in a new state in more than a decade. The moves could translate into an additional $1.5 billion of revenue a year by 2022, according to Morgan Stanley.

‘Extremely Excited’
“We are extremely excited to be expanding again, as smart regulatory policy and a competitive corporate tax system help us to deliver on our commitment to invest in our customers and communities,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said Oct. 12.


Jamie DimonPhotographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg
JPMorgan has resolved many of its compliance issues, but the OCC still has open enforcement actions against the bank, according to agency data.

Andrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, said the bank wouldn’t comment on supervisory issues.

“Opening new branches is a sustainable and long-term investment in the communities we serve,” Gray said. “Entering new markets will bring the full force of JPMorgan Chase’s business and philanthropic capabilities, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and allow us to serve more customers and local businesses by lending and investing in their community.”

OCC spokesman Bryan Hubbard declined to comment.

New Branches
In loosening their grip on JPMorgan, authorities removed a critical barrier to the lender’s growth. A 1994 law prohibits mergers between banks if the transaction would give any of them control of more than 10 percent of U.S. deposits. With $1.3 trillion, JPMorgan already controls more than 10 percent -- second only to Bank of America Corp. -- which means adding branches in new markets is one of its only avenues for expansion.


Joseph OttingPhotographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg
The reversal comes amid anti-regulatory fervor under Trump. It’s also consistent with the declared willingness of the new OCC head, Joseph Otting, to give financial institutions more flexibility when resolving concerns raised by OCC staff. Otting worked closely with future Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at OneWest Bank, now part of CIT Group Inc., when the lender came under fire for its mortgage-servicing business.

The OCC has softened its approach to overseeing banks from the aggressive tone under Thomas Curry, who led the agency from 2012 to 2017. Curry instituted tough standards in an effort to change the perception that regulators were too close to the institutions they were meant to police.

Relaxed Stance
Banks are responding to friendlier regulators under Trump by pushing into new markets and reassessing deals that likely would’ve been vetoed under Obama. Many elected officials and policymakers blamed reduced oversight for the 2008 financial crisis, which triggered the longest and deepest recession since the 1930s.

One person familiar with JPMorgan’s plans said regulation was only partly to blame for JPMorgan not broadening its consumer bank in the decade after the crisis. The bank constantly evaluated ways to expand the consumer bank, but executives were hesitant due to the cost and difficulty, the person said.

JPMorgan is embarking on the biggest expansion of its consumer bank in a decade as new liquidity rules encourage banks to draw more funding from deposits, which tend to be cheaper, and rising interest rates stiffen the competition for retail customers. Bank of America also announced plans to open up branches in new markets earlier this year.

“I’ve been waiting to do this for 10 years,” Dimon said in September.

I am lucky enough that my parents have been paying for my undergrad education but I will not be putting the burden of law school tuition on them, but I have no knowledge of how school loans work. I have read in some places that for law school, federal aid doesn't take your parents income into consideration even if you are declared as a dependent of theirs, which is great. But I don't know how or if getting married will affect that. There is also the possibility of needing to take out bank loans to cover whatever my federal loans don't cover. I also don't know how or if getting married will affect that.  
As for my boyfriend, he will have about $30k in undergrad loans upon graduation and plans on going into the workforce. His loans are in his parents name but both of us want to take on the burden of paying that back as soon as we can. Upon applying for law school and aid, I don't know if my boyfriend will be full time employed or what his income will be, so I'm also not sure how that will affect my chances of getting loans.   
TLDR:  
My questions are:   
1) Will getting married affect my chances of federal aid or bank loans for law school?

This leads me to think, what will happen if the next recession occurs in 1-2 years from now while interest rates are still very low?

The Fed will have no ammo left to reduce rates significantly which will make any recovery much more drawn out. We could experience a ""lost decade"" as Japan has.

I'm genuinely scared that the Fed blew their load during the 2008 recession, and now it feels like they waited too long to start rising rates again, so when we do have another crash, they will have almost no wiggle room to reduce rates as they are already so low.

personalfinance,Hoping to be a homeowner in the next few years... is this even feasible for me?,"Hi folks,

I’m looking for some feedback. I’m 28 years old, and I live in the Boston area and work in the mental health field. I have 77k in student loans, 22k in savings, $3,400 car loan at 3.4% interest, and I’ve been maxing out my employer 401(3)b matching account. I make about 43k per year at my job.

I am in a weird situation where I am intentionally not paying off debt because I’m in the federal public service loan forgiveness program (PSLF), and I’m paying the minimum monthly payment (~150 a month) in the hopes that in 7 years, I’ll be student loan free. My car payment is $100 per month and the interest is rolled into the loan. I’m trying to save as much as I can, but my field doesn’t pay well, and I have to work for a nonprofit in order to keep my PSLF status, and community mental health nonprofits = low salary. I’m very slowly climbing the ranks at my job that will hopefully lead to small increases in pay over the next few years and I’ve taken on a side job for a bit of extra cash. I have also recently signed a 4-year contract with my employer that will result in 30k repayment of my student loans by 2020. I signed this contract for the 30k as backup plan in case the PSLF program gets cut or if for some reason I don’t end up having my loans forgiven in 2026 and need to pay them off myself. 

I do my best to save anywhere between 350-500 per month in a high interest savings account, which isn’t much, but sometimes I can afford to throw a bit more in there. I really want to purchase a 2 bdrm condo in the south shore area of MA before I get completely priced out, but the housing cost here is astronomical and I fear that by the time I have enough saved up for a down payment, prices will have skyrocketed to the point where my extra savings will not matter and rent hikes will consume any extra increases in salary I receive along the way. At this point, I’m calculating that I would need at least double/triple what I have in savings to comfortably purchase a home at 20% down to avoid PMI, and I really want a 2 bdrm because having a roommate to help with finances would be great, and I also hope to have a space to foster a child maybe in about 10 years. 

I’ve thought a lot about how to invest/increase my savings, but because the stakes are so high for me and I have so little, I don’t feel comfortable throwing any money at this point into investment accounts or even a Roth IRA because I cannot afford to lose a dime towards down payment savings. Time is also not on my side, I’ve been moving further and further out of the city each year, and yet the rent continues to rise. 

So, what are my options? Should I try to get approved for a mortgage in 2 years once my loans are paid down to about 50k through my contract so that I may qualify for more and just put down as much as possible on the down payment? Or is it a better strategy to try to find special home-buying programs where I can put down 3.5% so that I can buy something ASAP? Is it possible for me to even buy anything with my salary in eastern Mass before Boston becomes San Francisco? Buying a home for me is as much as a financial decision as an emotional one – being forced out of renting situations year after year is exhausting and having to come up with 1st/last/security months in advance every 1-2 years also impacts my ability to save consistently.",finance

# **Dow dives nearly 300 points, S&amp;P 500 dips into correction levels in another wild day on Wall Street** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/26/stock-market-us-futures-show-drop-for-dow.html)*
*****
&gt; Stocks fell sharply on Friday as investors slogged through another volatile session on Wall Street.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 296.24 points lower at 24,688.31 after dropping 539 points at its lows of the day. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.1 percent to 7,167.21. At its lows, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen more than 3 percent.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.7 percent to 2,658.69 and briefly entered into correction territory, trading more than 10 percent below its record high reached in September. The average stock market correction, since WWII, results in a 13 percent drop and lasts for four months if it does not turn into a full-fledged bear market.
*****
&gt; Larry Benedict, CEO of The Opportunistic Trader, said traders ""don't want to be long heading into the weekend."" He added, ""S&amp;P now down on the year and people are more afraid to be long today than they were when market was 10 percent higher.""
*****
&gt; Seven of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors are down at least 10 percent from their 52-week highs, including energy, materials and financials. Around three quarters of the index's stocks are also in a correction.
*****
&gt; ""The 19.7 percent correction in 2011 is as close to a bear market as we've had in recent years. I don't think we'll get close to that, but I think we're heading for a deeper correction than the one we had in January and early February,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. He noted investors are realizing that earnings growth will slow down moving forward, thus they are pricing this in.
*****
&gt; Among the driving forces for the market's sharp drop on Friday were disappointing earnings from key tech companies that overshadowed strong economic data.
*****
&gt; Amazon fell 7.8 percent after the company released its latest quarterly results on Thursday. Alphabet shares, meanwhile, dropped as much as 5.6 percent before closing 1.8 percent lower. Earnings for both companies topped analyst estimates, but revenues fell short.
*****
&gt; There were ""high expectations"" for this earnings season, King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management, told CNBC. ""The earnings are not coming in as great as people had suspected,"" Lip said, adding that ""for Amazon specifically, forward guidance was surprisingly light.""
*****
&gt; These declines were enough to offset a better-than-expected report on U.S. economic growth. The Commerce Department reported the U.S. economy grew at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter, above a 3.4 percent estimate. The government also said its personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, a key measure of inflation, increased by 1.6 percent last quarter.
*****
&gt; Stock have suffered in recent weeks as fears of rising inflation — and rising interest rates — trim corporate profit expectations. Since the PCE index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, any sign that the measure may be slowing could stall the central bank in its plan to continue to increase the overnight rate.
*****
&gt; Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, surged by 4 percent in the third quarter, the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014.
*****
&gt; ""The GDP number really solidified some of the points that have been made for the fourth quarter,"" said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. ""The Fed is still on track for another rate hike"" even though the inflation numbers were a bit weaker than expected.
*****
&gt; The major averages posted big losses for the week. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow dropped 3.9 percent and 3 percent this week, respectively. The Nasdaq pulled back 3.8 percent.
*****
&gt; These losses add to a sharp drop seen throughout this month. For October, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 are down 6.7 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, has lost 10.9 percent. The Dow is now on pace for its biggest one-month decline since May 2010, and the S&amp;P 500 is tracking for its biggest monthly loss since February 2009. The Nasdaq is set for its largest one-month pullback since October 2008.
*****
&gt; ""What's happened is we have a number of outside issues overshadowing what has been strong economic data and overall good earnings,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; Several factors have conspired to knock markets down this month — some earnings disappointment, fear of rising interest rates, a brewing conflict between Italy and the European Union over budget spending, criticism of oil power Saudi Arabia after the killing of a dissident journalist and finally, worries that world growth is losing steam.

# When Do Markets Get Volatile?

&gt; After the S&amp;P 500 Index’s least volatile third quarter since 1963, October has ushered in a wave of volatility: Daily moves in excess of 1% now feel like the norm.

&gt; Here’s what you need to know about volatility: It tends to happen when the S&amp;P 500 is in a downtrend and beneath the 200-day moving average. For example, the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 7.0% in the third quarter and did not gain more than 1% in a single day. In contrast, the S&amp;P 500 has gained more than 1% three times already this month, but it is still down 7.2% so far in October.

&gt; The 200-day moving average is simply the average close of the previous 200-day trading days. This is a long-term trendline that many investors use to determine if stocks are in an uptrend or downtrend, but history has shown that the most volatility tends to happen beneath this trendline.

&gt; “Big moves tend to happen beneath the 200-day moving average,” said LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, 23 of the 25 largest one-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 took place beneath the 200-day moving average.”

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the majority of the largest gains and losses took place beneath the 200-day moving average. With the S&amp;P 500 currently beneath this important trendline, more volatility could be in store for investors.

# Five Takeaways on October’s Rough Ride

&gt; October has been a rough month for equities, but then again it’s historically been one of the most volatile periods of the year.

&gt; “October is known for volatility, and we’ve sure seen it so far,” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, by many measures, October is poised to be one of the worst months in years. The S&amp;P 500 Index has had two separate six-day losing streaks this month for the first time in history. That pretty much sums it up.”

&gt; Here are five takeaways from October’s action so far:

&gt; The bad news.

&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 is down 8.8% month to date, which would make this the worst month since February 2009 and the worst October since 2008 if it finishes the month at its current level.

&gt; * After not posting a daily move of more than 1% throughout the entire third quarter for the first time since 1963, this month has already seen six days out of 18 (33%) close at least 1% higher or lower.

&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 has been down 14 days so far in October, the most for any month since May 2012. Also, 78% of the days this month have closed in the red (14 of 18), the worst for any month since 82% of days in April 1970 closed down.

&gt; Now, for some good news.

&gt; * Since 1950, there have been seven other years when the S&amp;P 500 was positive year-to-date at the end of September, but fell negative year to date at some point during the month of October. The final two months of those years were higher six times and up 4.1% on average.

&gt; * Historically, the last few days of October have been some of the strongest of the year. With markets looking extremely oversold, the stage could be set for a rally.

The month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-three DJIA (since 1950) and NASDAQ (since 1971) month. November is second best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 2000 (since 1979). November is the Russell 1000’s best month (since 1979).

&gt; In midterm years, November’s market prowess is relatively unchanged. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 midterm years since 1950 with an average gain of 2.5%. S&amp;P 500 has also been up in 13 of the past 17 midterm years, gaining on average 2.6%. Small-caps perform well with Russell 2000 climbing in 6 of the past 9 midterm years, averaging 3.5%. The only real blemish in the November midterm-year record is 1974 (DJIA –7.0%, bear market ended in December).

personalfinance,Does a co-signed loan help establish credit?,"We're looking at buying a new(er) used car for my son as his hand me down car is getting pretty high in miles and is quite outdated from a safety standpoint (mid 90's design with no ABS or traction control and probably outdated crash standards)...

We can afford to pay cash for the car but I'm wondering if it would be worthwhile to instead finance part of it in his name with me as a co-signer. I'm contemplating this for two reasons:

1. The dealer usually gets a kickback from financing as I understand it, and I wonder if this might give us some negotiating power.
2. He's 18 and has no credit history. If we finance it under his name with me as a co-signer and have him make payments (note he doesn't have a job currently so we'd actually be making the payments) I am thinking it would help to establish a credit history for him which might be beneficial. 

is this dumb? We'd pay a little more but we could just finance a small part of the car and only for a year or two so it'd not be a huge interest expense. Although I don't know how they factor interest rates with a cosigner, would it be based on me or him or a combination of the two?

Perhaps it would be best instead to just pay for it and get him a secured credit card to start establishing credit history?",finance

personalfinance,Auto Loan Refinancing through Credit Karma,"Hello everyone,  


Around this time last year my old 95 Honda decided it was done. I had to purchase a new vehicle and ended up getting a vehicle for 25000, and an interest rate of 10%. Every month I have paid my automobile bill on the first day of the month and have had 100% payment history. My current bill is around 524 a month.  


Creditkarma keeps telling me that I'm overpaying and could possibly qualify for lower rates.   


This is my current policy information:

|**$524/month**MONTHLY PAYMENT|**10.44%**APR EST.|**63** **months**REMAINING LENGTH|**$7,645**REMAINING INTEREST EST.|**$25,276**REMAINING BALANCE|

These are all in forbearance/grace until later in November. I am supposed to make monthly payments of $200 for a period of 10 years. I am planning to pay these off very aggressively (\~$2000/month) starting November, as I have just started my new job. One of the benefits my company offers is a partnership with SoFi for student loan refinancing. I also get a welcome bonus of $600 upon signing up with them.

&amp;#x200B;

SoFi is offering me a fixed interest rate of 5.674% with monthly payments of $375.04 for a 5 year term. So I would pay a total of $22,502.40 with this plan. Their estimated lifetime savings for me is $1,668.

&amp;#x200B;

With the original loaner, I would pay $200 for 10 years, and would pay a total of $23,956 ($19,493 principal + $4,463 accrued interest).

&amp;#x200B;

It seems worthwhile to me to take the SoFi offer, as I would ultimately pay less in interest by \~$1,500 and get the $600 bonus, but I'm quite new to all this and the higher interest rate and higher monthly payments is bugging me. From what I've read, people usually refinance to get lower interest rates or lower monthly payments, not higher.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there going to be any kind of catch or downside to this if I'm already planning on making high payments on my own anyway?",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth saving for retirement if you have student loans?,"I assume not. If the interest rate on the loans is &gt; return on 401k or whatever investment you're doing, then you should just pay the loans of first instead of doing any investing, right? 

If this is true, should you actually use all the money you would have used for retirement investments and dump it in to student loans? I've heard that paying student loans off too fast can make your credit score look bad.

My net income after taxes and health insurance is:  
$3100/month  
Rent and utilities cost approximately $1300 a month.  
Food: I have a terrible grasp on the grocery/fast food/eat out budget admittedly. Somewhere around $300-400/mo

Here's my plan:  
Get a loan to pay off all my credit cards. Freeze my credit cards at zero balance. Instead of paying $400 per month on various cards, I can pay that PLUS some on the loan. I can then apply various extra cash-flows to the loan, like the surplus from the Pell Grant each semester (approx $800 twice a year).   
  
In approximately 6 months I can begin picking up extra overtime shifts at work (registered nurse), which will add approximately $800 gross to my check (taxes not calculated here because I don't know how they would look).  
  
I just feel like I am in such a shitty situation here. This doesn't even address my wifes credit card debt which is somewhere around $15,000 also, with similar interest rates.

1. Is it just me, or is the site getting slower and slower each time they redesign it?
2. After logging in, it shows my accounts. I want to open each of my accounts in a tab but either I don't know how or it doesn't let me (right clicking my account does not show an option to open in a new tab, middle clicking it doesn't work).
3. Once I open an account, the asinine new design forces me to hit the left and right arrow buttons to scroll through my accounts.  Why can't they just list my accounts so I can just click on it? I have to go back to the main page to see all my accounts on one page. And combined with #1 and #2 above, it's a horrible experience.
4. Some of my other Capital One accounts I had linked have disappeared??
5. And this final one is the most frustrating: it used to be that when I transferred money from my 360 to a non-360 or vice versa, it was immediate. Now I have to wait a few days. Why? They are both Capital One.

I went so far as to submit a feedback to Capital One. Maybe if enough of us who are frustrated submit a feedback, they will do something about it.

personalfinance,33M + 31F with a 2 year-old seeking help/advice/motivation with a plan to work towards financial independence.,"My post got deleted from r/financialindependence so I am moving it here. I hope it is a better fit here and doesn’t get taken down.

I have spent some time lately looking through the posts on r/financialindependence, as well as r/personalfinance, and I am determined to get my wife and I on a better financial plan for us, and our daughter. I want to apologize for how lengthy this post may be, but I am going to put it all out there in hopes we can get some solid advice from people who are clearly doing things the right way.

I am 33 and she is 31. We got married in 2013 and had a little girl in 2016, with hopes of having another little one in the near future. I am a field developer for a company that buys and sells land with an average salary of about $70k, depending on bonuses. I am also partner in a small business that brings an extra $30k (my share) or so, but my business partner has expressed that he wants to try other avenues so I’m not sure where that will end up. My wife is a marketing director for a successful restaurant chain here local to us in north TX with an average salary of around $65k, again depending on bonuses. She is also a photographer, but only does it part-time until she builds a larger portfolio to warrant full-time work. Her side job brings about $8-10k extra right now, while it’s still small. Hopefully that will go up as she is actively growing the business. So, we make about $170k combined a year give or take.

Now for the fun stuff, DEBT! I don’t think we have TOO much debt compared to a lot of our friends, or how people in this area tend to live; however, after reading through posts on here, I feel like we have a LOT of debt, lol. Our mortgage balance is around $270k (3.875% interest rate) with a payment of $2,200 including escrows. We owe just under $40k (3.9% interest) on my car, and around $34k (2.9% interest) on hers. Payments for both total about $1,300, including insurance. She also has outstanding student loans that we have been paying $400 a month on, with a total balance of around $19k (around 3.5% interest) left. The only credit card we have is a Southwest Airlines credit card that we use as our debit card and we pay it off every month to get free flights so we can visit family up north every year. We have a $14k line of credit at the bank with a 7% interest rate, but we haven’t used it at all so it has a $0 balance. That’s about it as far as debt goes, but obviously there is more money going out each month than just that. We tithe to the church that we attend. In writing this, I am realizing we aren’t giving near enough (our salaries recently went up), but we give about $850 a month to the church. Unfortunately, we live in a pretty expensive area and child care for our 2 year-old is $1,250 a month as we chose to put her in a pretty highly regarded school to help teach her, rather than just a daycare. Also, we pay almost $1k in health insurance cost each month. I, unfortunately, have to be on wonderful marketplace insurance as my employer doesn’t provide it and I have pre-existing conditions (battling cancer since 2009) that forces me to go that route. I also have what seems to be like never-ending medical bills coming in that usually get taken care of when we get them. They are usually less than a couple hundred dollars here and there. Those are pretty much our main expenses with exception of cell phone bill and utilities.

As far as assets go, thats where we fall short. We don’t have a whole lot to our name. I have some guns, a high-end mountain bike, and some collector’s coins/money. Total worth of my assets is around the $10k range. She has photography equipment and some jewelry. Her assets total about $15k in value. We have about $10k in the bank as well, not much.

There you have it, our financial situation in a nutshell. If you have made it to this point then I want to thank you for taking the time to read this and caring enough to know about our situation. Any help or advice you can provide would be much appreciated. Feel free to criticize if you feel necessary as we probably deserve it. We would ultimately love to own our cars and house, but FI by mid 40s would be fantastic, and the end goal. Thanks again for all of your time and help with this!",finance
personalfinance,Student loan consolidation with no personal but good household income,"My wife graduated in September 2017 with 45k in student loan debt. 

The interest rates and amounts are about:
30k- private variable 5%
7k - federal variable 4.2%
8k - private fixed 5%

Given the rapidly rising interest rates, we are looking into loan consolidation to reduce the interest, preferably to a fixed rate. Currently, she is unemployed and I make $120k per year.

My questions are:
1) Do you think it will be beneficial to consolidate at this stage?
2) Is it possible to consolidate if the individual with the loans has no income but the spouse has a sufficient income?
3) Is it possible to get a quote if the individual has no income but the spouse has no sufficient income? What companies would provide this?

personalfinance,Am I being an idiot for paying off my loans this quickly?,"I recently refinanced \~40k worth of student loans down to a fixed 1.95% interest rate.  Being in debt drives me crazy, so after refinancing I have continued to pay it down aggressively (3k per month, roughly 3.5x the minimum). 

It now occurs to me that in addition to the opportunity cost of not putting this money in the market (which I was OK with) there might be some costly tax implications.  Hoping you all can help clarify.  

With my current loan payments I have been contributing just enough to my 401(k) to hit my employer's match.  For simplicity let's just say I'm falling about 10k short of the 18.5k cap.  Assuming a 25% tax rate, if I lowered my payments and put the additional 10k in my 401(k) would it reduce my taxes 2.5k?

Further, I believe my current MAGI puts me just above the cutoff for the student loan interest rate deduction.  Would another 10k in my 401(k) reduce my taxable income and allow me to capture the deduction again, at least in part?  

Would this have implications for my state income taxes? I'm CA based. 

I hate being in debt enough I'm willing to lose out on a couple hundred bucks in tax breaks for my own mental well being, but if it really adds up I'll move things around. Any help in quantifying the cost of my current set up would be much appreciated!

i dont own those bonds. Need people to explain what those terms means.

1) 7.95% notes due 2026 bond have 180M outstanding and ""Principal Amount Tendered"" = 46.7M . They only want to buyback 46.7 out of the 180?

2) If yes to (1), why not just buyback completely 7.95% notes due 2026 or 7.70% notes due 2026 since the mature date/ interest are about the same and deal with less one outstanding note?

3) whats ""Reference Security"" and ""Fixed Spread (bps)"" on the site means?

4) ""The Total Consideration includes an early tender premium of $30 per $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes"" If i sell them back $1000 they will give me $1030 ?

5) ""7.95% notes due 2026"" If i have $1000 that means every year i have $79.5 interest. But with current low interest environment bond value will go up if the company is a safe company. Let said it safe company, (79.5/ .06 ) = $1325 . Its worth 1325 why sell it back for 1030?

6) Recently they want to offer new bond(did they sold it yet?)  with lower interest rate (4.375%) to buy back those higher interest bond. If people think they are safe company and worth the 4.375%, then those old bond should be 1817 (79.5/ .04375) . Why sell them for $1030?",finance

Banking,[USA] Is there some sort of new law (or policy) that prevents cash deposits into accounts that you don't own?,"I opened up a savings account for my daughter (minor) with Wells Fargo. I didn't want to use them, but they are the only one that is basically all over America. This matters because my in-laws will be moving to Florida and they want to deposit cash into her account for her. My wife opened the account in CO where we live with her name as the sponsor or whatever it's called. When she opened it she asked specifically if her mother could deposit into it at any location, that was the whole point of the account, and they said yes. She deposited an opening balance.

Fast forward to now, a few weeks later, and her mother went to deposit six hundred dollars cash into the account and was denied. She is still in Colorado for another day but she'll be moving to Florida tomorrow. When she was denied they told her there was a limit of $500 per day for cash, or unlimited for checks. When asked why, they didn't really give an answer. Later that day she was in another store that had a bank inside, she was still curious so she asked one of those bankers about it. They told her it's to ""prevent money laundering"" because of the new marijuana businesses, basically aimed at preventing weed stores from depositing money through third parties, and it was passed a few months ago. (I know marijuana is not federally legal so they can not legally use banks due to federal law.)

Is any of this true? It doesn't seem to make any sense to me. The government has no right to see anyone's finances or track their funds unless they are under investigation of a crime. Can they require your money be traceable for their convenience? This is basically the beginning of outlawing cash. It also seems to have major flaws because this is the first time I'm hearing of it and I deposit cash into my own and my wife's accounts (not Wells Fargo) all the time without ever being IDed. I just deposited over $2,000 at an ATM using my debit card, today.

Can anyone tell me if this is true, or partially true, and either clarify or point me to a source that I can read for myself? There has to be missing pieces to this, because it doesn't add up. If this is true then it is essentially an outright ban on cash.",finance

They are federal loans so the interest rate is reasonable, nothing too crazy. My minimum payment for the student loans is somewhere around 330 combined. I'm currently paying $500 per month to the loans.

My question is: should I pay more than $500 for the student loans or start contributing a bit to my Roth IRA? I guess it boils down to whether the compound interest growth in the IRA will end up being worth paying slightly more interest on the student loans.

CryptoCurrency,Introducing Inbot InToken,"Hi everyone, I am the founder and CEO of Inbot, the makers of InToken, a token running on Stellar blockchain and listed on StellarX and Stellarport. Here's who we are.

&amp;#x200B;

**Inbot Ambassador Community &amp; Platform**

Inbot Ambassador is a global community of 64,000+ people, who introduce data- and AI-powered companies to their customer prospects worldwide. Our People Graph AI finds the best person to introduce you to each customer, and our members receive Stellar-based InTokens as compensation, when their intros result in customer meetings.

After developing the AI for 3 years, we started our business in 2017. Our revenue from the first 9 months of 2018 was approximately $400,000 - a 100% growth from the whole 2017 revenue. We have helped our partners to meet and close deals with companies like Vodafone, Allianz, Volkswagen, Google, Nokia, Deutsche Telekom, Givaudan, Migros, McKinsey, Comcast, Dow Jones, Innogy, Deloitte, KPMG, Nasdaq, Accenture and many more. Our community has access to over 7 million decision makers in 183 countries.

Harvard Business Review says 84% of business deals start with a referral. We witness that every day: our partners have seen up to 50% conversion rates from our introductions to deals. We are doing our best to build trust in a world where everyone else seems to resort to aggressive robotic spam and cold calls.

We address a huge market in B2B lead generation, with focus on building trust and long term relationships. We did this business with euros and dollars before introducing InToken. We invented InToken to address real challenges we faced when paying our community members all over the world.

We also wanted to create automated micropayment incentives for building trust and helping the community grow. These would have been almost impossible to implement with euros or dollars. The introduction of tokenized rewards grew our community by 20x in 9 months, and more than doubled our revenue during the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

**InToken is a cryptocurrency for business referrals**

InToken is a Stellar token, currently listed on StellarX and StellarPort. Businesses purchase them as rewards for introductions, and our community members earn them for their help. This happens via [Inbot Wallet](https://app.inbot.io/) that is a federated Stellar Wallet with automated functionality for rewards distribution. We require a full KYC from all wallet users, and accept token purchases with euros directly from the wallet.

We are planning on adding support for full Stellar addresses and conversions to XLM and EUR directly from the wallet in the future.

Inbot takes a 30% platform fee from the paid rewards, and send the rest of the rewards to our community members based on their InScore. It is a private trust multiplier that makes sure those members who build the most trust get the biggest rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

**We listed InToken without doing an ICO**

InToken supply is therefore fairly limited. We have a 3,500,000,000 total supply, out of which 98% is still held in the reserve. As the community grows, the supply will gradually come into use, provided that the underlying business in the community grows. Our 30% platform fee stakes the coins effectively, creating stability to the token value over time. We consult our community on the use of the platform fees, i.e. if they should be burned or distributed back to the community.

We offer InShare personal retainer agreements to those members who introduce new partners to the Inbot platform. They pay a small amount of monthly tokens that we recycle from the 30% platform fee when we don't burn the tokens.  InShares are also the primary way for us to provide a small additional supply of tokens to the circulation for the duration of next 20 years. We want to provide stability and liquidity to our community.

If the security token regulations evolve positively in the coming months and years, we will consider converting InShare retainer agreements into tradeable security tokens. Right now, they can't be purchased or traded, only earned.

We are working on supporting new token rewards that businesses can offer, starting with automated token rewards for social media promotion for our partners.

&amp;#x200B;

**Experienced team of serial entrepreneurs**

personalfinance,Personal loan question,"Hi guys, 

Little bit of background...I’m a stay at home mom and my husband brings in a steady but tight income. We have 3 credit cards with about $3500 debt total. Because of our current financial situation, we are only making the minimum payments. Because the interest rates are so high, we are basically paying just the interest every month and the over all amount stays stagnant. I was looking into getting a personal loan to pay off the debt and just have the loan to pay back. If I do this to pay off the credit cards, we would not use them anymore and just keep the lines open to continue to build credit. I would like to ask around before actually doing so since I don’t have experience in this area. Also, if anyone has used a personal loan, who do (or don’t) you recommend?",finance

personalfinance,Refinance auto loan or wait?,"This is my first post here, I've read through the ""start here"" guide and it made me extremely anxious about my current finances.  I am a recovering addict, so my credit is trashed and for the past 20 months I've been trying to rebuild my life, including my finances.

I have a decent job at a bank, making 35k yearly. I am taking full advantage of their 401k match.  I have a credit card with high interest but I only use it for Spotify and Prime and then immediately pay it off so the balance pretty much stays at 0.  I pay the minimum on my student loan payments (I owe 6k).  I had about $250 on Robinhood in ETFs and stocks but I just sold all of them and will be putting the cash into an Ally savings account to start up my emegrency fund. 


My biggest stressor right now is my car  loan.  Alittle over a year ago I financed a 2013 Nissan Altima at 23% interest through Credit Acceptance. $315 a month for 60 months.  I currently have about 48 months left to go.  I got approved by Capital One for 12.46% for 36 months. I also got approved by a local credit union got 9.75% for 36 months. The credit union will require me to set up a checking account with them in which my paycheck gets directly deposited in order to auto pay the loan payments. They also require I keep an active savings account (it only accrues .05% interest if I read their website correctly).  I had a second local credit union deny me after reviewing my credit history.  So I've have three hard inquiries on my credit this week.

I've read people talk about putting a down payment when refinancing an auto loan - I expect to get around $1000 tax refund next year... Should I wait until the refund and use it as a down payment, or should I jump on the offer to cut my interest rate in half?

Tried to provide all the relevant info... If there's anything else lemme know I'll provide the honest details!",finance
personalfinance,Car Loan Question,"I am currently buying a used 2016 Ford Fusion with 24k miles. I am 22 yr old just graduated college and have been working full time for 6 months. The only credit I have built up was 1700/ of school loans which I already paid off and the monthly CC I pay off. The loan would be for around 17k or so and I did a 72-month loan with a small warranty for electronics. Monthly payment is about 272-300 depending on how they come back. No early payoff fee and I plan on overpaying the loan at about 350/mo but I work a sales job so wanted to give myself a lower monthly payment. 

My big question is the best thing I can get approved for is a 6-8% interest rate loan from where the dealership is quoting me... I don’t have anyone to co-sign, but this seems a little high to me? I live in the Midwest US. Are there other options for me such as going to a credit union and getting a loan? Or is it just a bit higher since I am buying a used car as well as being fresh out of school with little to no credit? Also, would it be an option to refinance in a year or two once I have better credit? Only problem I see with this is they may only cover the value of the car not the warranty..

personalfinance,Graduate Student in Need of Budgeting and Future Planning Advice,"Hi PF, 

I have been doing my own loose budgeting for a while and want to get some outside opinions. I'm in my first semester of a 3 year master's thesis project. 

My breakdown:

Income/Other Holdings:

\~$1500/month graduate stipend

\~$100 in savings

\~$850 in retirement from a previous job

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly outgoing payments:

Rent - $300

Utilities - $70 at the most; obviously fluctuates with use; usually less than this

Home and Car insurance - $92

Monthly tuition fees payment - 2 more payments at $360 (will owe another 1200 at beginning of spring semester)

Monthly computer payment - $110 (12 months no interest; will be paid in full by September 2019) My 7 year old computer broke and I needed something as soon as possible and decided to upgrade. May or may not have been the best idea, but my computer is my livelihood as a graduate student, so I splurged a bit so it will hopefully last 3 years of graduate work and into my next venture. 

I understand food and gas are not in my budget. I get a lot of that reimbursed due to the nature of my graduate project. 

&amp;#x200B;

Debts:

Student Loan - around $6500 left at 3.5% ( I pay as much as I can monthly when I have excess money)

Family loans - $700 (one at $300 and one at $400; interest free)

Rotating credit card debt - Gets paid in full every month. I churn points every month. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically my strategy right now is paying down debts as much as possible when any excess money is in my account that I won't need for food or gas. I know my emergency fund needs to be fluffed as soon as possible and I'm trying to knock the family debts out before I start splitting excess payments between emergency fund and my student loans from undergrad.  I'm wondering if I should pull the money out of the retirement account since I feel so strapped right now to help pay down debts? I understand there would be penalties. Not going to lie, I don't quite grasp how that works and how poorly that might affect me. I just feel like I'm at a point where I'd like to get all debt square and then start squirreling retirement and other long term investments.

Any recommendations or questions welcome! Thanks!

1) Paying off loan #2 completely for the psychological boost since it's such a low balance ($183) and also tied for highest interest rate (6.55%).

2) Pay loan #2 down to $1 and keep it open for my credit file average age of account purposes, since it's also one of my oldest accounts.

3) Don't do a bulk payment and instead raise the monthly payments for the two 6.55% loans (#2 and #4) that I'm currently paying more in interest than principal on, so that I'm paying more principal than interest with each monthly payment.

2) Re-fiannce my home and use funds for investments.  How much should I re-fi for if so?

investing,China tariff effects started showing up in shipping data months ago,"&gt; China's latest report on economic growth fell short of expectations, but for those who monitor traffic on the global water highways, the news was not a surprise.

&gt; In fact, freight and shipping data over the last several months have been pointing to such a slowdown.

&gt; An investor can get an idea of a country's economic health based on the types of products and the number of containers being shipped to and from its ports at any given time. About 90 percent of the world's trade in goods is transported in containers on ships across oceans, making maritime activity a key economic indicator.
It is also an important indicator for companies like Walmart, the giant retailer that depends on shipping the products it sells from overseas.

&gt; A previous economic slowdown in China started showing up in the shipping data six months before other people noticed, said Gerry Wang, the co-founder and former CEO of Seaspan (SSW), the world's largest container shipowner. In a 2012 interview, he said his business had a unique window on global economic activity. ""We are involved in everything from commodity trades, manufacturing and consumption,"" he said then. ""Our volume is 200 times more than parcel carriers FedEx, DHL or UPS. Ninety-nine percent of all the goods you see at Walmart are shipped via container ship.""
The Trump administration's tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese goods went into effect in July. For weeks before that, there was a huge push to import products ahead of the tariffs. Container trade between China and the U.S. from April through June grew 10 percent year over year based on Accenture's analysis of the Department of Commerce import and export data.

&gt; This was the container trade in the commodities on the list of tariffs that went live in July.

&gt; According to the Seabury Global Ocean Trade Database, import volumes dropped significantly after additional tariffs were imposed. U.S. imports of Chinese steel and aluminum dropped 53 percent after tariffs on those products went into effect in March compared to March 2017, and imports on the $34 billion of Chinese goods dropped 21 percent since the July tariffs went into effect compared to the prior year.

&gt; Data are still pending on imports of the $16 billion in Chinese goods subject to tariffs as of August and another $200 billion of goods as of September.

personalfinance,I need some guidance on whether or not to pay of my wife's car.,"Throwaway here, as I value my privacy from my friends and coworkers knowing all about my financial business.

My wife purchased a 2005 Nissan Rogue earlier this year after totalling her older car. General numbers are: $9000 upfront cost after all tax, title, docking fees, etc. $2000 down, payment of $155.00 approximately every month for 48 months. I'm not quite sure what the interest rate is. 
Our other finances in a nutshell: Rent $850/month, elec/gas ~$45-$65 monthly, internet $65/month, and approximate spending on food/groceries is around $600/month. Yikes, typing out my grocery spending is quite offputting. My truck is paid off. $26k in savings currently. about $300 in checking.

Aside from the advice to not eat so much of my money, which I am working to control as of this last month when I calculated the numbers, I am hoping for some advice on what some of you folks would do in my situation. My wife puts a big chunk of her income toward this car payment every month, and its pretty tight financially for us right now. We're both one semester away from finishing our bachelors (her second) degrees and will most likely be taking some time off to start a family in the next 6 to 12 months. My thought process is that since we have the money to pay off the car now and still have an adequate emergency fund, we should do it to avoid paying more in interest. Although, we want to move out of the country for graduate school and bringing the cars is not logical as the expense is very high.

We both work, although she works more than I do because unfortunately she makes less than me. Would you pay off the car, or would you keep it in the emergency fund?

personalfinance,Stuck in the flowchart. How paying more than the minimum on student loans seems to make things worse. Advise Needed.,"Hello everyone. I've been browsing this sub for a few years now and following the flowchart has been incredibly helpful to get my finances in order but now it seems like I'm hopelessly stuck. After building up my emergency fund and making sure I'm matching my employer 401K contributions I have a bit of disposable income left. Hurray! But looking into investing I hit the same advice over and over. The pay-down-your-debts wall. Well it just happens to be that the wall is really really tall in the order of $154k in graduate student loans and under my current Salary trajectory I've done some highly speculative calculations that suggest that it may be better to pay the minimum and wait for forgiveness under the PAYE program. Please see the details below and tell me I'm an idiot and utterly wrong and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. I've included a spreadsheet below with all my process for those who want to see how I'm getting these numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

**The situation:**

I have $154,079 as current balance on 7 grad loans, a combination of Direct Grad Plus and Direct Unsub with a weighted interest of 6.06%. Of that sum only $134,722 is principal. The rest is uncapitalized interest that I've accrued over 2 years of making minimum payments under the PAYE program, around $269 monthly. Over these two years I've focused on saving an Emergency fund and moving to a new city. In order to cover interest now I'd have to cough up **$679.51** each month, just to keep that $154K from growing! I currently make 58K a year and assuming a 3% growth each year it will take a long time until I can pay the interest plus extra to bring that fucker down.

I've crunched the numbers for 3 future scenarios. One where I keep everything as is and wait for forgiveness. The second where, where I pay more to cover interest and wait for forgiveness and the third where I refinance.

**Scenario 1 - Keep paying the minimum.**

&amp;#x200B;

If I keep paying the minimum payments for the remaining 18 years until the PAYE forgiveness kicks in I'm looking at paying 78K in minimum payments but still having a stupidly high loan balance around $225K that will become income right after forgiveness. Assuming the 3% salary growth rate I'm looking at having a total taxable income for 2037 of $324K, ouch! If I were to pay taxes on that today where I currently live that would translate to 97K of additional tax burden for that year. So if I add up the 78K in minimum payments + 97K additional tax blow and throw in the 5K I've already paid up to now you get a total loan cost around **$180K for this scenario 1**.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 2 - Cover the interest.**

If I start paying $679.51 to cover interest not only will I destroy my savings/investment opportunities for the near future but I'll end up having payed $148K on 2037 but still having a $154K loan balance that will become income after forgiveness. Under this scenario I'm looking at an additional tax burden of $63K which is pretty doable but when you add all of it up including the 5K I've already payed up to now you get a total loan cost around **$217K for scenario 2.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 3 - Refinance.**

I haven't explored this option that much but I called around a couple of banks and I'm being offered a refinanced interest rate of 3.95%. Sadly and because the student loan industry is messed up my interest will capitalize at that point so this option only makes sense if I do it immediately. Having a principal of 154K under a 3.95% interest paid over 15 years represents a monthly payment of $1136 which is about the limit I can do under my salary and even then I'd have to change a bit of my lifestyle. Paying $1136 over 15 years is about **204K for this scenario 3.**

Each scenario is laden with its own series of risks and assumptions. But I'm sure there is a rational way out of this, its just weird to me that not paying more results in a cheaper end result than paying more. If you guys have any insight on things I am assuming wrong or should look into I'd greatly appreciate it. I'm leaning on scenario 1 for now until my financial situation (or opinion) changes. More broadly I have one more question for everyone.

Given that student loan interest under PAYE does not capitalize as long as you pay the minimum, is there not a magic amount you can invest that given a compounding return rate can equal or surpass the final tax burden on forgiveness year? Say I invest 50K-60K over the next 10 years with an ROI of 5% would that not amount to more than the 97K tax of scenario 1 in the year 2037. I got time on my side so why not use it smartly?

Thank you for taking the time to hear me out. Even though its been two years in repayment this all feels very new to me still. I've attached a spreadsheet where I've worked on these scenarios [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/Pk1mQpR).

personalfinance,60 days late on a $20 credit card bill. How can I repair my credit ASAP?,"I used a credit card I never use, and that had no balance for a $20/month subscription. I thought I canceled but got another $20 charge  after cancellation. Because I thought I had no balance, I didn’t make a payment on the credit card for two months. Once I noticed, I immediately paid the card off in full. 

Just found out that 60-day delinquency 20 dropped my credit from over 750 in May to 677. I’m in escrow on a house and now looking at full point increase on the interest rate over what I would have with my good credit score. 

Called the CC provider to plead my case (always pay off in full, the small amount shows this was clearly an unintended oversight, etc.). They said there’s nothing they can do because they accurately reported, but suggested I try to get the last payment refunded by the merchant, in which case they can say an improper charge caused the delinquency. 

Merchant refuses to refund the payment since it’s over 60 days. I disputed the charge with my CC provider, but that can take 30 days to resolve, and I close escrow before then.

I have 9K in cash from the car I sold, My dad said he'll contribute another 6K to make it a total of 15K so I'd only be borrowing 6K.

I'm good on my money but I also don't want to be denying myself a decent life either. I'm against financing new cars for 60-80 months but I'd pay off this 5K over the next year or two and I good credit so it wouldn't be such a high interest rate either, and I'm putting down 15K in cash.

investing,"Many calling for a bounce next week, but we have a major problem - We haven't give a name for this correction yet","There are so many traders/experts calling for a bounce next week or the correction ending in Nov. However, there is a major issue here, we don't know whats really behind this selloff. For the past 10 years since 2008, we had breixt selloff, China 2015 Aug meltdown fresh crash, Feb 2018 Vol explosion.... etc. We knew the cause of the selloff almost at the first week when it started. I monitor more than a donze of indicators, even more than half are trending down, but just not enough to trigger selloff like this. Yes we knew Fed's language change, its huge. but the capital is actually pretty confusing. The junk bonds(spreads) are doing bad, but not too bad. Credit market is awful, Bond prices went down together with stocks price. Midterm election/buyback share blackout period? They both start to end or ended in first week in Nov. Why ppl are dumping shares so bad when they knew the market is coming back up right afterward. It doesnt make sense. I don't want to talk about the data or TA here to debate with you guys. None of MSM or experts are clear define why this is happening. This is bad news. The correction have started a few weeks we know nothing yet. Fed and election are not major catalyst for this correction, what is it? I understand there are many bearish data out there, but they are not bad enough to trigger a sellout like hundreds points a day. They are selling on every bounce and rallies.

I believe until we know whats the real reason behind this correction, it will continue regardless of any short term relief.

For all the past correction, we knew when it is about to stop, for example, the expert who trades Vol, they knew when the excessives will sort out and game back to normal. I found nothing in the media or from the experts, even the bearish, doom experts dont have anything can convince me, they just repeat what they have saying.

Hope to hear some good and serious insights from you guys.",finance
personalfinance,"Living With Girlfriend, New Apartment, Student Loans, etc. - How to best manage, what to cut, etc.","Hey all, I'm 22, and I graduated college in May with a bachelor's in biomedical sciences. Unfortunately, my degree is pretty much useless until I further progress my education, which I can't really do until I get some research/healthcare experience. It also means my student loan payments are coming up next week, which will be an $180 minimum payment/month to tackle about $34k of loans with 4-6% interest rate.  I've been working at my university with a research team making $13/hour for three 10-hour days/week (I'm not legally allowed to work 40.. not sure why. It's just the way it is), so I bring home about \~$600-650 biweekly. My girlfriend can't afford going to college (situation where parents make a TON, but won't provide), so she's trying to work however she can. She currently works at a doggy day care 30-40 hours a week for about $9 an hour, so she's bringing in around \~$400-450 biweekly.

We just moved into an apartment together. Due to living in a college town, everything is super expensive, but we picked the cheapest option. Our rent is a static $995/month (with ALL utilities included with no caps) that we can split however we'd like. Since I made more at the time of moving in (she had a worse job before the dog day care), we split it $750/month for me and the rest for her. So, as for expenses, it goes something like:

**Me** (no insurance or non-student loan debt to pay off)\* Rent: $750/month\* Pet ""Insurance"" from Petsmart: $40/month (Want to cancel this; just not sure where else to go)\* Grocery shopping: $150/month\* Student Loans: $180/month\* Gym = $10/month\* Pet Food = $40/month (Big puppy..)\* Gas = $40/month (normally only fill my tank up twice a month due to having a rental available for work).\* = **$1200/month**

**Her**\* Rent: $250/month\* Phone: $50/month\* Car Insurance: \~$110/month\* = **$410/month**

Also, after moving in, we've had to look for used furniture, pay a medical bill for our puppy, etc. Luckily, I saved about $3250 in savings before moving in, but I've had to take out about \~$900 to pay for everything and also pay off my credit card. By the time I pay rent at the end of this month and my student loans at the beginning on next month, I'll have under $200 in my checking.

So here I am. I'm wondering if there's a better way to manage everything financially. I'm constantly stressed knowing I can't save nearly as much as I used to (if at all.. god forbid I have a medical emergency or have to repair my car whatsoever). We've been trying to look for better jobs, but I personally can't find something that both 1) pays as well AND 2) contributes to my research/patient care hours for future schooling. We've talked about me finding a part-time job for the other 4 days I don't work too, but I haven't acted on that yet. Anyone have any advice for two dumb kids? Anything is greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR: Two early-20s adults move into a new apartment. It's financially stressful for both of us. Was wondering if there were any moves we could make/plan to help our current financial situation.**",finance

personalfinance,"Tried r/Advice, Maybe here? Parking Tickets &amp; Debt","I tried to post this on r/Advice, so I will try here if that's cool.   


So, I'm in a lot of trouble and am just sort of coming back to the real world from some really bad mental health issues that I won't get into here. I am 25 single in greater New York State.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have around 5 approximately two+ year old tickets from various towns in NY from when I was in college against my license, preventing my from driving legally. I haven't been driving since I got the notice. I was licensed to drive in another state at the time and made the choice to ignore the tickets. Of the five or so, only one is for driving without a license (as I did not have it on my person, it was valid at the time.) All the others are for mechanical issues such as faulty head or tail lights. I no longer have the vehicle. I have the numbers for the tickets and counties they are in. I still have and am technically registered to drive (though suspended) in the other state. I called each county office like 6mo ago and left messages but didn't hear back. I know, I know, just call again. I plan to. I just wanted to know what my options were regarding those tickets.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Can I even get some kind of traffic lawyer to help me negotiate them all and get driving again sooner? Please humor me here, I really know next to nothing about all this and transportation is a major issue to at least two of these courthouse locations in rural NY. I know the fees were estimated to be about 1k collectively due to fees regarding opening the tickets again then pleading guilty then paying a fine when I called over two years ago after I got the four suspension notices (one for each ticket). Does time change anything? I realize my choice to ignore the tickets was a foolish decision, so how do I make this right and get back to being able to drive?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have some past due credit card bills that have fallen to collection agencies, on top of my federal student loans I just more or less have ignored for about a year, on top of Sallie Mae breathing down my neck (which I do pay and am close to being caught up on at least). Credit cards are over four years old- two altogether. Sallie Mae I started paying in Feb or so, and Federal Loans may have been emailing me about paying them around then too.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I also have medical bills I've been ignoring and am behind on my electric bill and rent. I make \~70k but am overdrafting after spending every paycheck within days. How do I even begin to deal with this mess I got myself into? I know about YNAB- I made a mint account ages ago as well. I feel like I need a good shaking and someone to lay out my options clearly and concisely so I can stop panicking.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks, and if there's a better place to ask please say so. I'm new to reddit and pretty nervous about trying to tackle this all",finance

CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrencies are negative as OKEx announces plans to delist 50 cryptocurrency trading pairs,"### Crypto News

* A joint report released by the British Business Federation  Authority (BBFA), venture capital fund, Novum Insights, and  cryptocurrency exchange, TodaQ, urges that UK regulators use caution in  instituting far-reaching regulation. BBFA Chief Executive, Patrick  Curry, said to Cointelegraph in regards to UK crypto regulation, “It is a  very blunt instrument approach and I haven’t seen this in other  countries.” This news comes after Members of Parliament that sit on the  UK Treasury Committee called for increased cryptocurrency regulation to  protect investors and urged the Financial Conduct Authority to supervise  cryptocurrencies. 
* Bitstamp, a large cryptocurrency exchange, has been acquired by  NXMH, an investment firm based in Belgium and owned by NXC, a South  Korean gaming-focused conglomerate. Signed last Thursday, the  acquisition still leaves Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodric as a minority owner  and allows the CEO to continue running Bitstamp’s operations. Pantera  Capital, an early backer of Bitstamp, will also retain a 6% ownership  stake. Although Bitstamp users will not see immediate changes in the  platform’s services, the exchange has a long-term pre-existing roadmap  for improvements that NXMH agreed to stick to during negotiations.  
* Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, Coincheck, saw its revenue fall  66% in CY3Q2018. Acquired by Monex Group, Inc. on April 16th, 2018,  Coincheck is the notable Japanese cryptocurrency exchange that was  hacked for USD$532 million of digital assets in January 2018. According  to Monex CEO, Oki Matsumoto, Coincheck is still awaiting a license from  Japanese regulators to operate as a cryptocurrency exchange in the  country. Coincheck’s quarterly report discusses the revenue loss,  saying, “Since service suspension in January 2018, Coincheck only  allowed existing customers to sell their cryptocurrency. The limited  revenue stream resulted in segment loss of 0.6bn yen (USD$5.3 million).  Coincheck has improved governance, internal controls, and internal  audits, aiming for full-service resumption.” 
* Jason Hsu, known as Taiwan’s, “Crypto Congressmen,” is continuing  to push forward-thinking regulation concerning tech in Taiwan as he is  proposing new rules surrounding token sales. This past Friday, Hsu  proposed a slew of policy recommendations geared towards assisting  cryptocurrency startups -- notably, one of the recommendations would see  the country’s Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) establish a new  business category for cryptocurrency firms while another recommendation  would see new legal framework established for security tokens. Last  week, the Taipei Times reported that Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory  Commission would see standards established for initial coin offerings  (ICOs) by June of next year.  
* MapleChange, a small Canadian cryptocurrency exchange, was hacked  this weekend resulting in the loss of all consumer-owned funds.  According to a series of tweets this weekend, hackers exploited a bug in  the exchange allowing them to withdraw the entirety of consumer-owned  funds from the exchange. Maplechange has suspended users’ accounts in  light of the events. MapleChange has noted that it will open wallets at  some point in the future to refund users as with as much money as  possible. 
* OKEx, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges by daily  trading volume, is delisting more than 50 cryptocurrency trading pairs  from its platform due to weak performance. As per an announcement  published on October 25th, 2018, OKEx will delist these cryptocurrency  trading pairs due to weak liquidity and poor trading volume. OKEx  specified in their announcement that only the indicated trading pairs  would be delisted, and not the cryptocurrencies themselves. Andy Cheung,  Head of Operations at OKEx, tweeted this weekend, “Getting listed is  not final. Maintaining a good performance is the key to success.” 
* SP Group, a large utility company based in Singapore, is launching a  blockchain-powered renewable energy certificate (REC) marketplace, as  per a Monday company press release. In discussing the blockchain-powered  REC marketplace, Samuel Tan, Chief Digital Officer of SP Group, said,  “Through blockchain technology, we enable companies to trade in  renewable energy certificates conveniently, seamlessly, and securely,  helping them achieve greener business operations and meet their  sustainability targets.” 
* The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is recommending that all of  its members take action to control the exchange of cryptocurrencies,  their storage, and other crypto-related activities. Founded in 1989, the  FATF is an intergovernmental organization based in Paris with a  directive of establishing standards to fight money laundering and other  illegal financial activities. While speaking to Russian news outlet,  Izvestia, Vice President of the Federal Financial Monitoring Service of  the Russian Federation, Pavel Livadny, expressed a desire to institute  controls on crypto transactions of more than 600,000 rubles (USD$9,120).  Earlier in October, the FATF made changes to its standards relating to  digital currencies and businesses dealing with cryptocurrencies.  
* Ukraine’s Economic Development and Trade Ministry has launched a  state policy to reclassify and legalize crypto-related activities, as  per Ukrainian news agency, Ukrinform. According to a statement issued by  the Economic Development and Trade Ministry of Ukraine, the purpose of  the state policy is to, “create understandable conditions for conducting  activities in the field of virtual assets and virtual currencies,” and  to usher in, “adoption of the concept of a state policy.” Ukrinform  details in its report that the state policy will be completed by 2021 in  two separate stages.  
* US household cleaning supplies manufacturer, SC Johnson, and  environmental organization, Plastic Bank, are opening multiple plastic  recycling centers in Indonesia that will use blockchain technology to  reward users. SC Johnson recently revealed data that indicates five  Asian countries are responsible for more than 55% of the world’s plastic  leaking into the ocean -- these five countries are China, Indonesia,  the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand. SC Johnson and Plastic Bank  believe that blockchain technology can be used to distribute tokens to  individuals based on recycling efforts, not only helping to combat ocean  pollution but potentially reducing the poverty level of Indonesia  itself.

personalfinance,Federal Employee TSP,"Hello Personal Finance!

I am now at a financial place where I can max out my TSP and I want to know where my money should be. I’m trying to learn this through my Agency and the internet - but it is difficult to understand. 

I plan to contribute the full $18,500 per year starting Jan 1 2019. My Agency matches 5%. I also plan to start the catch up ($6k) in in 2037 when I’m 50. Obviously these amounts will go up with inflation. I plan to retire just shy of 63 in January 2050. My current salary is $118,410. My pension will be FERS and I have no special pays (eg - not law enforcement). I also dont plan on withdrawing TSP funds when I retire until I need to or am legally required. 

Here are my questions:

1. How does the matching work? Is it 5% of my salary? 5% of what I contribute? 
2. Should I be messing with the funds - or put it all in the L2050 fund? 
3. If not L2050 - then where? I would like to be comfortable and fiscally safe when I retire rather than involve my self with risky investing. 

Thank you in advance for any replies!

P.S. My wife will also be pushing the full amount exactly the same as me (same age and all). Except she is 401K and gets 2% matching. She’ll get no pension.",finance

I need a bit of guidance.  Upon checking my credit report it shows I have a collections report with TransUnion by I C Systems.  They have not contacted me, and I do not have access to the account number.  I went through the Wiki here and it was geared towards a collections agency that has been contacting the debtor.  Also all I have is a PO Box for their address located in MN.  I was wondering if I should call them to get my account number and verify their address, or go about that a different way.  Also in regards to the ""1-2 punch"" process.  Should I dispute with TransUnion the exact same day as I send the debt validation letter to I C Systems, and lastly could someone post a simple how to guide on how to go about that process as I haven't found too much on the exact process of disputing with TransUnion.

personalfinance,Help with 401k Allocation,"Hi Everyone,

Hoping you can help out. My mom is 60 and is semi-retiring (going part time, working 2 days per week, due to personal situation). She only has $150k saved up in her 401k. Her Spouse is continuing to work and makes \~$175k per year so they should be fine for a little while. Spouse is 66 so will collect S/S soon, and she will put off to at least 66 to maximize benefit. He also has another $200k in his 401k, all of it in a Target Retirement 2020 fund. Mortgage should be paid off in 2 years.

She asked me to look at her 401k allocation. Below are the details. She was considering moving it all into the American Funds 2020 Target Retirement fund (AACTX), but expense ratio looks high and her current allocation has yielded a higher return due to higher stock allocation which is obviously more risky.

They will not withdraw any of this money for at least 5 years and they currently continue to contribute.

**Is this an appropriate allocation for somebody age 60 who is semi-retiring, and will fully retire in \~5 years? I'm also a little concerned about the Federated Bond fund as it looks like a third of the assets are mortgage backed securities.**

\[Side note: You will probably easily do the math and realize the 401k balances should be higher by now. They both spend way beyond their means, have credit card balances, all sorts of frustrating things I won't get into and have tried unsuccessfully to change\]

personalfinance,Read over the FAQ but still have questions about Rollovers &amp; Employer Matching,"Hello,

I'm trying to help my SO transfer over his 401k. A few details:

His previous employee had a pre-tax 401(k) with an employer match of 5%. At the moment, he has 2.8k sitting in their old account. It is not attached to any target/investment fund - so the interest rate is something similar to a savings account rate. 

In mid 2018, SO got a new job that runs their 401(k) through Fidelity and matches 6%. Account is fully vested at 4 years. Now - I thought it best to select the Fidelity's Retirement Fund 2055, for now, until SO is more financially literate and can manage the fund himself. The fee on that is $7.5 for every $1000. 

A few questions, mostly because I am self-employed and have never been offered a quality 401k. I invest in a Roth IRA. This is definitely in the ELI5 territory. 

1. Do employers allow you to chose between Roth, Traditional, or Pre-tax, or is it in your best interest to go with Pre-Tax for matching purposes?

2. (This is more personal) SO took this job due to the higher income, but sees it as a temporary move. I doubt he will stay with this company longer than 1 year - at which point the company has vested 20%. Is it recommended he leaves his old 401(k) where it's at, or move it into new company with the thought he might have to move it again, in less than a year?

Thank you for the ELI5 information guys. I promise I read the FAQ but I was still confused.",finance

personalfinance,Snooping Bank or Federal Regulations for Non-residents in the USA?,"Hi, this is my first post here so I apologize for any mistakes. If this is not the correct forum, please guide me.

Background: I'm an international student in upstate NY, and I'm here in the US on a student visa. I have funding for my graduate studies through an agency that provides me with a living stipend. The stipend is barely equal to the minimum wage, but it covers my living expenses (rent, groceries). I have a checking account with a bank - not sure if I can disclose the name here but the bank has branches in other states - that I use to collect my stipend checks. I only have a checking account, and the little I don't use stays in that checking account.

I have recently received queries from the bank branch staff about my transactions. My wife and I saved and paid for our recent wedding and since we don't have a shared account, each of us reimbursed the other one for the several expenses we had undertaken through our respective banks to equally share the cost. One of those transactions was a $2k check from me to her for reimbursement, and my bank asked me to provide further details for that outgoing expense. My wife and I also use Venmo (linked to our respective banks) to share grocery expenses, which, over a few months, totaled close to $1.5k, and we send each other money through Venmo for those transactions too. I had to explain that one to the bank as well. I also recently sold my laptop on Ebay to cover some of the expenses, and transferred the money back to my checking account through PayPal ($500 for the laptop). My bank also asked me to explain that transaction. The bank also inquired about my visa status and whether I plan to stay here after it expires.

I provided them with the details, and worryingly asked what the purpose was. Per the bank, their \`internal review board' needs these explanations for their record, and they are not reporting it to any other agency. In all cases, I have initiated the call to the number listed on the bank's website so I'm certain about the authenticity of the queries.

My question is, are there regulations that banks have to follow that can generate such queries? I have asked my other colleagues - none of whom are on student visas - and they've never had any questions like that from the same bank. Are temporary residents like me subject to additional regulations? To me, it feels like the bank should have no business asking me about this stuff, beyond probably ascertaining that I'm not raking in millions from an unreported business, don't have another income source, and am not engaging in any other illegal financial activities. Some of those would require questions about incoming transactions, but why ask about outgoing ones? Should I inquire further from the bank, or just change banks?

Thanks. I appreciate you all reading and taking time out to respond.",finance
personalfinance,"Recently Graduated, living at home. No expenses just yet, but want to plan to get ahead of the game with college debt and savings.","Hello all! 

Recent college graduate seeking some advice to plan for a stable and successful future where I don’t have to stress and fret about money and debt. I have developed very frugal and responsible financial habits over the years, and want to ensure that my foreseeable future will allow me to pay off debt and build a savings so I can live without immediate financial worry. However, I am not the most well versed in financial matters, and would love some input along with answers to a few questions I have.

I am very fortunate in my current situation, as I am living at home after school in NYC for 4 years, and have little to no daily/monthly expenses at this immediate moment. The majority of my work is either part time jobs within a very close vicinity of my house, or part time film work/freelance photography when in NYC. (I live within an hour of the city, and have the fortune of being able to crash on friends couches when I’m there for an extended period of time to save on train tickets)

I have spent the 4 years of my schooling working extremely hard to build a professional skillset and a wide network in the filmmaking/photography industry. It’s paid off, seeing as I feel very comfortable with the future in my field, and want to make sure I refine this skills and learn more in an attempt to seek better paying jobs that require more advanced knowledge and abilities.

I am using the financial flexibility I currently have to get ahead of my student loans to avoid increasing interest rates, while also building a formidable savings/emergency fund before I move out on my own again late next year. (I currently have about $30,000 in my name that I am responsible for paying off.)

My emergency fund is currently at around $3000 saved for now. I plan on investing some of this money into newer equipment for my photography/video work to gain the ability to command a higher pay-rate at a professional level.

The emergency fund takes more precedence over retirement for the foreseeable future, and when I feel it’s at a comfortable number, (let’s say $4000.) I plan on saving money into a separate fund for the first few months of rent for when I move out on my own.

Full time work is in the near future, at this moment I am taking the time at home working part time and focusing on ensuring my freelancing is at a professional level to have the ability to supplement additional income and allow for upward mobility in my career field. I feel that investing in myself professionally is the safest and best investment at the moment, as I have a wide professional network built on hard work and good will where I know I will be able to thrive.


With all of this said and done, I have a few questions for you all:

I met with a financial planner recently and was recommended to start building credit by opening a credit card and use it for all of my spending, and pay it off on time by storing my money in a bank with good interest rates. (I don’t spend money unless I have it, and feel disciplined enough to not be worried about abusing credit card debt.)
He told me that I should I look into a credit card with a good rewards program and a bank with good interest rates so that I can build credit while being able to reap the interest and rewards benefits, and not worry about high interest/late fees seeing as I will always pay it off on time since I’ll have the money. 

* What credit cards would you recommend that have a good rewards program/wont screw me?
* What banks would you recommend looking into that have good APR/APY?

A few more questions.

* What steps can I take to ensure I stay on top of managing my student loans and preventing the interest rates from skyrocketing?
* I am currently preparing to freelance professionally alongside full time work, what steps should I take when creating a small personal business? (tax information, separate accounts, etc.)

I can’t thank you all enough for your help. I am not the most financially astute individual, but I understand the importance of financial planning and discipline. I come from a family that has more often than not struggled with money and made more than a few bad decisions, but my parents have thankfully instilled the importance of me not making the same mistakes I did.

I work extremely hard at what I do and am deeply blessed to be able to do what I love, but I want to make sure that I am able to live without worrying about money, as I have done that for a significant portion of my life, and would love to be able to just breathe and live comfortably within reason.",finance

* A new report published on Nature.com finds that the carbon  footprint of Bitcoin (BTC) and its potential future growth could have a  significant effect on global warming. The report discusses that, even if  BTC follows a lower-level, “median growth trend,” its energy output  could equal that of the current total of global cashless transactions  in, “under 100 years.” The report goes on to read, “60% of the economic  return of the Bitcoin transaction verification process goes to  electricity, at USD$0.05 per kWh and 0.7 kg of carbon dioxide-equivalent  (CO2e) emitted per kWh, \[resulting in an\] estimate that Bitcoin usage  emits 33.5 metric tons of CO2e annually, as of May 2018.” 
* After the South Korean government initiated a ban on initial coin  offerings (ICOs) in September 2017, Min Byung-doo, a member of the  ruling Minjoo Party, has committed to end the country’s ICO ban. Min is  currently the Chairman of the National Policy Committee, a committee  which many consider the first hurdle in removing the country’s ICO ban.  In an interview with CoinDesk Korea, Min discussed that a lot of ICO  bubbles have already burst and that many people have learned not to rush  into ICO markets. Min also cited other countries, like Switzerland,  Malta, and Singapore, have recently made efforts to classify ICOs under  existing institutional regulatory frameworks.  
* Alrosa, a Russian diamond mining firm and the largest diamond  mining firm in the world, is joining the pilot of De Beers’ diamond  supply chain blockchain platform, dubbed, “Tracr”. Tracr is geared  towards improving transparency and consumer trust in the diamond value  chain. Tracr works by establishing a digital certificate for each  diamond and recording important attributes about each diamond. The data  is then stored on a blockchain where buyers can track all previous  transactions involving a specified diamond, allowing buyers to verify  that a diamond is natural and conflict-free.  
* Fujitsu, a Japanese multinational IT equipment and services  company, is building an interbank settlements platform that will use  blockchain technology. With a goal to, “confirm the viability of  blockchain technology,” the blockchain platform will be tested by the  Japanese Banks’ Payment Clearing Network, which is comprised of nine  Japanese banks. A press release by the Japnese Banks’ Payment Clearing  Network details that Fujitsu, “will additionally leverage the P2P money  transfer platform it developed in \[the\] fiscal \[year\] 2017 with three  major banks to generate the money transfers to other banks that will  trigger interbank funds transfer settlement.” 
* Notable privacy coin and the 19th largest cryptocurrency by market  capitalization, Zcash (ZEC), has enacted its “Sapling” hardfork that  will largely improve transaction speeds while reducing the size of  transactions themselves. ZEC’s Sapling hardfork should allow all users  to conduct shielded transactions, which are transactions that make it  near impossible to track a user’s private information. The Sapling  hardfork enables shielded transactions on ZEC’s blockchain to be 100  times “lighter” and up to 6 times faster.

The SBI is  partnering with Hitachi as part of the India Government’s, “Digital  India,” campaign. Hitachi Payments is a subsidiary of multinational tech  conglomerate, Hitachi, which reportedly has 55,000 ATMs and 850,000  point of sale devices in India. The SBI is India’s largest commercial  bank with over 420 million customers and more than 6,000,000 point of  sale devices in India. The joint venture between the SBI and Hitachi  Payments, dubbed, Hitachi Payments-SBI, will accelerate the  digitalization of financial services in India.  
* The UK Government’s, “Cryptoasset Taskforce,” published its final  report on Monday that details various regulatory steps concerning  cryptoassets and distributed ledger technology. Three different UK  Government groups make up the task force, including the HM Treasury,  Financial Conduct Authority, and the Bank of England. The report details  that the HM Treasury will work closely with HM Revenue and Customs to  update cryptocurrency tax guidance by early 2019. The report reads,  “While the authorities’ immediate priority is to mitigate the risks  associated with the currency generation of cryptoassets, the Taskforce  considers that other applications of DLT have the potential to deliver  significant benefits in both financial services and other sectors. The  authorities do not believe there are regulatory barriers to further  adoption of DLT.” 
* While interviewing with German business news outlet, Handelsblatt,  Felix Hufeld, chairman of Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory  Authority (BaFin), called for global initial coin offering (ICO)  regulatory standards. Hufeld said in the interview, “The number \[of  ICOs\] and the volume per ICO are both getting higher. Investors have  mostly minimal rights,” and added, “I can thus only recommend private  investors keep away from such things.” Traditionally, Germany has taken a  global stance on cryptocurrency regulation. Hufeld went on to add  during the interview that international standards for ICOs would be  “desirable” in the long-term and that conversations were underway in  “multiple international forums”.

personalfinance,Lower APR with car buying service compared to APR of a regular car loan?,"I am currently with Penfed, and noticed that when I apply for an auto loan for a 48-month term used vehicle loan, the APR is 3.74%, but when I go through their Car buying service option for used vehicles (Truecar), it's giving me an APR of 2.74%. I know if I was to apply for a loan, it takes a hit on your credit score to my knowledge so I would like to narrow down the correct choice before I apply for something that I might regret. What would be the better choice here? The regular loan would be a higher APR, but I can contact dealers and negotiate on my own. Or if I use their car buying service, I get a lower APR, but what are the other pros and cons of using the car buying service? Not sure if it's worth it to use the car buying service just to get a 1 percent less APR.... but if it is, then why not?",finance

Stats:
Salary - 55k (Midwest)

Checking account - 10k (Don't have savings account yet. Was planning on opening one and transferring some money to it from checking)

Don't have a 401k because company does not offer it. 

Expenses:
Rent - None. I live at home 

Health insurance - None. Covered under my parents until 25 I think. 

Student loans - 36k. 18k in parent plus and another 18k in government loans. Parent plus interest rates is over 6% and the rest is below 4%. I want both of these loans to be paid if within 2 years. What's the best way to do this? I will be paying for the parent plus on behalf of my parents. 

Credit card: Average $400ish a month. Mostly spent on eating out, Spotify, and sometimes on Amazon and Uber. It will probably be higher next few months because of black Friday shopping. I plan on getting a Xbox One.

personalfinance,HELOC on House?,"I recently learned that I need a new sewer line (or, at best, a $10,000 sewer line repair).

My bank is offering a $50k line of credit (not yet approved but the bank lady was optimistic). I have $14k credit card debt related to my ex not paying child support while unemployed, which he is now paying back, so I'm paying it down as fast as I can. However, the interest is about to go up to 8.7% (because the Fed is raising rates), and I can get the HELOC at 5.7%. My plan is to transfer the credit card debt to the HELOC, pay for the sewer line, pay the whole mess off as fast as possible, and never touch the rest of the line of credit unless the roof blows or something. (I jest - I don't live in a hurricane area. But I do have an old house so you never know what crazy thing will happen!) I live in a hot real estate market and I have lots of equity in the house, and I have a good FICO score and a stable job (salaried). I'm a single mom and a teacher so money doesn't grow on trees, and I want to be careful and make good decisions.

Is there any downside to opening up such a big line of credit? I'm NOT going to use it when I don't need it, and it seems like a logical choice, but am I missing anything?",finance

personalfinance,Buried in Student Loans - Need Advice,"Hello everyone.  I've been reading and lurking for some time now and I have come to ask for some advice.  I'm a recent graduate that went to a seriously expensive school.  I didn't know it at the time but that I look at the balances, these student loans are very overwhelming.  

I have a somewhat decent job now and am living at home and budgeting accordingly.  I make around $2750 per month after putting $400 into savings and a 10% 401k contribution.  I don't have a car payment, I spend about $500 a month on bills, gas, food, ect.  I want to say my personal savings and 401k contributions are alright.  However, I'd like to start focusing on paying off my student loans as fast as possible.  I am not sure how to go about them in the long run.  See the detailed descriptions below of all my loans:

 $31,200 @ 4.3 % (Federal Stafford)

 $30,600  @ 9.75%  (Navient)

 $30,000 @ 6.41% (Parent Plus)

 $27,800 @ 7.21% (Parent Plus)

 $22,600 @ 6.31% (Parent Plus)

 $4,500 @ 6.84% (Parent Plus)

Right now I'm paying more than the minimum for the 9.75% loan.  My total payment per month just for my loans is about $1,800.

I've looked in to loan forgiveness plans in my state... but I make just a tad too much to where i cannot apply.

With all that being said, I have saved up about $8,500 during my grace period.  Right now it's just sitting in my savings.  What would be the best way to go about this?   
Find a part time job?  Avalanche or snowball method (or a little of both)?  Take away from personal savings and hammer down the loans?  

I'm just really overwhelmed right now.  I haven't refinanced yet and am willing to do so.  I just want to get these paid off as fast as possible.  I know its going to be a slow 10 years (hopefully much less!)  I'll probably go crazy living at home that long with my parents.  If anyone can help me out with some early on decisions and shed some light on this, it'd be much appreciated.",finance

&gt; The technical indicator of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth as measured by a country's gross domestic product (GDP)

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp

The GDP of the US and Canada (I'm just gonna focus on North America) has been on fire for the last year showing no signs of weakness. This is why interest rates are moving up, and why the Fed and BoC is so hawkish.

But GDP doesn't necessarily relate directly to the stock markets. What we're seeing is a crash (correction.. pick your term) and that's all we can say. To somehow imply we're entering a recession when **most** (not all) high level economic indicators are fairly positive is asinine at best, and destructive at worst.",finance

personalfinance,"Would like to move into nicer, more expensive apartment for no other reason than to move and be more comfortable. Can we do this?","Hello!  
So my fiance (28m) and I (27f) have been living at our current apartment for 3 years and we are... comfortable. Lately we have been feeling like we are living in a dead area with nothing to do, and we've never really lived in the city in our youths, so for fun, we've been browsing apartments for rent online.   
We did find one we like, for over double what we currently pay, but the apartment itself is in a killer area and is significantly larger than where we currently live. While it is double our current rent, it's actually a good deal for the area. We think we can afford this move, but it's a little scary to jump up so much in rent. 
Here is our current financial situation:
We split $1450 + utilities, about $250/year in additional parking, $200 utilities. I get most of my gas paid for but he doesn't. We are fed at our jobs, and so we get a meal delivery service for the weekends, which totals to about $200/month in groceries. Maybe more here and there for treats and bigger dinners since I like entertaining.  
We are NETTING $15,100 between the two of us. He makes about $1600/ month more than me. We do not, nor ever have, had outside help. That being said, our work is contracted, so there is a possibility of one day finding ourselves with a month or two off between jobs. I can safely say that we will work all of 2019 no breaks, so we will be making that much per month for the year. That does make me feel better, so we will be making good money for the minimum 1 year lease.   
The apartment we like is $3200/month + utilities and maximum $230/month in parking for both of us (possibly less). Our work takes us all over the city and surrounding area, so there is no advantage in distance.   
We also enjoy luxuries such as housekeeping at $150/month, we have all the video game systems we want, we took two vacations this year...  This sounds like a brag, but we work between us probably 150 hours a week minimum, and it can be gritty work, so we do work hard for our comfortable lifestyle. We also never want kids.      
In terms of savings, he's has around $50,000, whereas I have around $25k in debt. It was 50k three years ago and I probably am able to put around 2k into it per month now. I would like to continue to pay my loan aggressively if we move. My grooming budget is fairly high, and I have taken steps lately to get it down.   
SO PF, is it as foolhardy as it feels? Should I scrap this whole idea and stay where we are, comfortable but bored? What kind of luxuries will I be giving up? What are the advantages for me for living in the city to help me feel better about this?",finance

crypto_currency,Bitcoin Air,"Plenty has been happening in the background while the development team and administration have been readying the front line approach to the market for Bitcoin Air. We have kept our community quiet and our development even quieter while we put together our many programs we plan to offer to the public prior to our actual fork date. It has been a great time so far developing with the team, and we can not thank our community enough for being with us in the early stages of Bitcoin Air.

&amp;#x200B;

This article will be presented to cover several topics that have been floating in the community, and to introduce the latest updates within our development. The community has been anxiously awaiting the biggest decisions within our development, included the finalization on which coins will receive our airdrop. We are here to announce several things including; our Ambassadors Program, our Minimum Viable Product Demo, our new Website, our introductory Partnerships, and the final decision on which coins will receive our Airdrop.

&amp;#x200B;

A New Beginning

&amp;#x200B;

We have taken the time to revise our overall approach to the public by introducing a completely revised website design to better signify what Bitcoin Air hopes to represent to the public. You will find numerous changes to our website including; a completely custom design template, expanded information that includes our team, media, and partnerships, our ambassadors program, and also our minimum viable product demo. This refreshed approach will aid in the presentation of Bitcoin Air and better express the ideas of what we hope to achieve with Bitcoin Air.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the time of our revision, there has been some bumps in the road with our community, team, and overall plan for development. This is normal within any community focused development and we have taken the best approach to solve any issues that have arose within our community. Some of the issues I want to touch on today revolve around Haven Protocol and the overall vision of our development along with what differs us in whole, and how we plan to revolutionize the stable coin initiative.

&amp;#x200B;

There has been some discussions coming from the Haven Protocol team in regards to our fork and their outlook on receiving it. Mixed emotions have held the team in a discussion as to whether or not Haven Protocol should be included in the air drop due to the communities mixed feelings about the development. This has led to our development team placing a hold on whether or not Haven Protocol will actually receive the airdrop and whether they will receive XAP or USDAP.

&amp;#x200B;

Our Project Lead, Anthony, has been in constant discussion with both Peercoin and Haven Protocol alike in regards to gathering solid support across administrations to ensure that all communications and development needs are met up to a reasonable extent to create a clear channel for updates, development, and communication. Through this, we have agreed that only two communities should receive Bitcoin Air ($XAP). Peercoin and Bitcoin holders will receive Bitcoin Air at a spread rate which will be described below in the Official Fork Details.

&amp;#x200B;

Over this long silence from our team, we have been solidifying several large scale partnerships that will be explained below in “The Future of Bitcoin Air”. This article also signifies the beginning of our Blockchain Development, and over the next few days, you will begin to see commits to our GitHub. Currently, it has been left empty until our main front end products and partnerships were completed. This is falling perfectly in line with our predicted road map and we appreciate the community for staying patient with us over this time.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bitcoin Air Ambassadors Program

The Bitcoin Air Ambassadors Program has been developed as a means of providing 100 lucky participants with the chance to permanently earn a position as an Ambassador within their country and aid in the constant growth and outreach of Bitcoin Air on a large scale level. The main goal is to allow us to produce as many points of contact for our development as possible, in as many countries as we possibly can.

&amp;#x200B;

Our Ambassadors will be in charge of social network outreach, planning and organizing of community events, BETA Testing and Functionality, marketing and promotion efforts, and much more. They will be our front line team when it comes to countries reaching out to Bitcoin Air on a personable level. Ambassadors will play the largest role in ensuring that Bitcoin Air achieves it’s maximum potential in achieving it’s goal of producing a currency that provides back to the environmental efforts of maintaining our planet and personal well-being.

&amp;#x200B;

Ambassadors will be trained and briefed on the dynamics of Bitcoin Air and it’s functionality, they must be capable of a professional attitude, demeanor, and presentation when it comes to representing Bitcoin Air and it’s team alike. Every chosen participant will have the chance to earn Bitcoin Air (XAP) on a monthly basis via conversion based marketing and promotion utilizing their social networks and events that may be happening in their area; like seminars. Ambassadors who are hired will be provided access to our Ambassadors Panel that will give them access to a variety of content to market with, social network API’s to easily share and promote Bitcoin Air, a place for event planning requests to be filed, personal conversion links to maintain records of who brings the most attention to Bitcoin Air, and a internal payout system that rewards the top Ambassadors with the most conversion. Bitcoin Air Administration will dedicate funding monthly to a pool that will be split completely between 100 Ambassadors proportionate to their share of the growth margin during the month prior.

&amp;#x200B;

The Ambassadors Program will begin with an application process that will allow us to gauge the communities interest over time leading up to the fork date. A series of interviews will be given to the chosen participants to gauge their ability to grow Bitcoin Air and utilize the resources provided in an efficient manner. All members of our community are encouraged to apply and see if they are chosen to become one of the 100 ambassadors chosen world wide to aid in the growth of Bitcoin Air.

&amp;#x200B;

The applications will be announced in the next upcoming article. The application process will allow only non-anonymous participants as we would like our Ambassadors to be friendly and welcoming to the public to approach them to gain information about Bitcoin Air. We will ask a series of question via form, and over time will begin to reach out to capable applicants to receive a second interview. The 100 chosen participants will then receive escalated privileges to the Ambassadors Panel and will be trained and briefed leading up to the Bitcoin Air Snapshot and Fork.

&amp;#x200B;

Applications will begin August 21st, 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

Minimum Viable Product Demonstration

A lot of you may see, that we have been operating our development some what like an ICO. Hiring in different Advisors and types of staff to ensure a successful road map is followed throughout the development. To ensure that the public understands what we are hoping to achieve here in the slightest, Bitcoin Air has made efforts to develop a Minimum Viable Product Demo that will allow you all to test the waters of what is to come for Bitcoin Air over the next few months.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This minimum viable product demo will feature a simple to use App Store Demo that will give you a hands on feel of how Bitcoin Air will operate when it is released. This is in no way our final product template, nor will our demo be utilized as a our main feature set. We will be expanding on this MVP drastically as we receive input on how people react to the usage and feel of our demonstration.

&amp;#x200B;

You can utilize our demonstration via a tablet, mobile, or desktop interface. It will display the basic features that are to come to the Bitcoin Air Pay System that will allow several key features to fluid merchant transactions and consumer usage. The idea behind the MVP is to provide a hands on template of use for people to gather what is to come before deciding to support Bitcoin Air in it’s endeavors to becoming the largest small business based consumer stable coin.

&amp;#x200B;

All comments, edits, and recommendations can be submitted to [mvp@bitcoinair.net](mailto:mvp@bitcoinair.net). Anybody submitting revisions or edits will be provided a bounty if we use their edits.

&amp;#x200B;

The Future of Bitcoin Air

Throughout the constant development going on, there has been extensive brand growth that has blossomed the final and true vision of Bitcoin Air. Initially beginning as an initiative to create the first collateral backed dual-chain stable coin that can give back to the planet through merchant-consumer based usage. This vision has blossomed into large scale partnerships that will aid in creating the most versatile and scalable merchant based payment system to come from a cryptocurrency development.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin Air has reached an agreement with the US Blockchain Association to acquire $210,000,000 in Carbon Credit Asset Reserves to back the minting and burning of USD Air Protocol. This means that every $1 of USDAP (1 USDAP) will be backed by $1 of Carbon Credit Assets. Coupled with this asset backing, Bitcoin Air will be included in the future release of 50,000+ ATM’s worldwide being developed by the US Blockchain Association that will allow users to sell their $USDAP or $XAP and receive local fiat currency at anytime. This will allow Bitcoin Air to be fully asset backed up to $210,000,000 in carbon credit reserves at any given time through the partnership with the Mother Earth Foundation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What we hope to come from this partnership, is to produce a positive impact on the environment through financial transactions by allocating mint/burn fees to the growth and preservation of the Carbon Credit Reserves. Through this growth, the available asset backing of $210,000,000 will expand, allowing more collateral to be available to back USDAP as more users require to mint into a stable coin market. Carbon Credit Assets grow and drop in value as well; as the value of the reserves grow, profit margins can begin to be taken from the Assets and given back to the holders in forms of buy backs or raised stake earnings for an extended amount of time. Proceeds kept can be used to produce green air initiatives and fund scientific studies to develop means to reduce the carbon footprint of humans on the planet. The end result would be a positive impact on the Earth, through basic means of every day use by merchants and consumers alike.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The future vision of Bitcoin Air is to decentralize the small business market and return the power of the fiat, reserves, and financial system back to the people of commerce and trade. Through the use of a dually operating bilateral blockchain, we hope to bring the age of asset backed stable coins to a new level by pairing the power of dual chains with the Lightning Network, Segregated Witness, and Atomic Swap. Through these, we hope to develop the most user-friendly, scalable merchant payment system that can aid in giving back to the planet through day to day actions that people are already accustom to today.

&amp;#x200B;

More on the future of Bitcoin Air will be released in a later article detailing our source, algorithms, and much more including a more detailed analysis on the technical aspects of our development.

&amp;#x200B;

The Official Airdrop Information

After a long discussion with our team, and having several conversations with both the teams at Haven Protocol and Peercoin. We have decided to airdrop $XAP to only holders of Peercoin and Bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

After careful consideration, and numerous requests from the community, we have decided to NOT move forward with airdropping to Haven Protocol due to some of the communities disagreement with our project, and the extensive bad background that has accumulated with Haven Protocol including Bitcoin Bravado and the recent Nanex Hack. We have fully agreed to move forward with the airdrop, and the only difference is now Peercoin and Bitcoin Holders will only receive Bitcoin Air ($XAP).

&amp;#x200B;

The ratio for Bitcoin and Peercoin Holders will be announced shortly.

&amp;#x200B;

The official snapshot date will take place on Thanksgiving Day, November 22nd, 2018.

deeplearning,Fedora is enough good for Deep Learning?,"Hi.

I used to use Fedora for backend development, when I started to learn deep learning I saw that everybody uses Ubuntu. 

But Fedora is enough good for DL too? I am not sure about that if I install the Nvidia Cuda tools, those will be fully compatible with Fedora or Ubuntu better?  


Because Fedora always changes the Linux Kernel and if I am right the NV Cuda tools build for a specific linux kernel.

Here what I see: [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target\_os=Linux&amp;target\_arch=x86\_64&amp;target\_distro=Fedora&amp;target\_version=27](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&amp;target_arch=x86_64&amp;target_distro=Fedora&amp;target_version=27) \- Cuda tools support only Fedora 27.

personalfinance,Roth or Traditional IRA for 20s in high federal tax rate bracket.,"Before I start, I’m sorry to ask stupid questions in advance.

I’m considering to open IRA account. I read Roth/Traditional IRA posts from this sub. But, I would like to get some advice based on my background. Since my annual income is around 100k with a high percentage of federal tax bracket, I assume that I should go for traditional IRA. (I’m 26 years old) But, I assume that the tax rate will be higher in the future when retirement comes and I’m expecting my income will be getting higher. I’m also afraid of I may need to take out money before the retirement, like before 65 years old.

If anyone knows the difference in details, would you please advise me which IRA account should I choose? (like break-even parameter or any parameter that I can choose one or the other) 

Thank you.

personalfinance,Recently I learned that interest is screwing me when it comes to paying my student loans.,"Hi this is my first time posting on reddit. So i dropped out about 4 years ago after going to school for 2 years. I have been paying the 2 loans i got for 3.5 years now.

I have one loan in my name which i owe $13K left and most of it is at 3.15% interest. That one im not worried about. I have another in my dads name that i still owe $63K at 7.65% and this is the one thats screwing me. I pay $510 a month on it and recently learned that only $95-105 goes towards the principal, the rest goes to interest.

So my questions are - is there anything i can do to lower that interest rate? Is there anything i can do to get the loan in my dads name switched to my name so i can claim it on my taxes? And are there any ways i can pay this off faster without just throwing more money at it like getting it reduced in any way?

Edit: i agreed with my dad that i would be paying for college regardless if the loan is in his name so i do feel responsible",finance

personalfinance,Am I crazy for considering this?,"Sorry for the wall of text, wanted to be thorough. I’m also on mobile so excuse any typos.

Currently, I have a role with an established company that I am doing well at. My background is in the sciences and my current role is really as a project manager more than a scientist, although there is still a technical component of report writing, critical decision-making, and etc. I have been given more responsibility and typically outperform my peers. Recently, there have been instances of older and more experienced PMs messing up projects or falling short. As a result, I have taken ownership of a number of projects and have excelled in the role, even saving some projects from being transitioned to another firm. Until recently I was managing a larger “book of business” than some of the older PMs that again have underperformed while also executing the work I am driving myself/self performing due to being understaffed.

My company has acknowledged this and worked to resolve the issue; however, my industry (environmental consulting) is notorious for overworking and undercompensating. In the last year I have received a few bonuses totaling ~$8K and my salary has increased from ~$61K to ~$68K. Although that is a great improvement, I still feel undercompensated given what I am doing. Both in terms of the level I am currently performing at and my work volume. I also know due to looking at billing documents on a monthly basis that the senior PMs I am on level with if not outperform make upwards of $20K more than I do. A lot of this is driven by the fact that they have several more years experience and can bill out at a higher rate due to our MSA terms (PM @A with B years experience, Senior PM @C with D years experience, and etc.).

I have felt burnt out as of late and have begun to explore other options. Although busy, I’m not engaged. Recently, a friend that owns a roofing company was expressing his need for an operations manager. I mentioned that if I had a background in roofing that I’d throw my hat in the ring. He responded with he actually wanted me due to his understanding of my PM skills as well as the fact that I have no aversion to working/some labor associated with what he does. He and I discussed a bit further and I mentioned that I’m on track to potentially obtain partner and would like to be able to work towards gaining equity in his company should I make a switch. His company is a few years old now and was started out of his poor experience with a previous boss. He has mentioned that he could cancel all of his work (2 month back log), refund everything, not sell another roof for a year, and still keep the lights on/pay his people for a year. He also has expressed the potential he sees in bringing me on to grow and expand. Also, we are both very aware of the strain that working together can cause to friendships and do not want that to be the case.

The catch is I would be a 1099 employee for him. I understand the risk involved with that and my compensation would have to be adjusted accordingly.

Currently, 29, single, and debt free other than my house ($150k) with a $68K base. I also have an emergency fund of ~$30k with another ~$30k in retirement. Annual bonuses vary greatly and 6-8% is reasonable to expect.

The position would be for $90-$95k. I would want to clearly define, or as clearly as it can be, a path to equity. Which could be as little as a year. Additionally, once I go beyond operations and start helping to sell there is potential for bonuses and additional compensation.

I typically am pretty risk averse; however, the idea of getting out of my industry and having an opportunity to make more while working towards partnership/equity sooner is alluring. I also believe I’m young enough to take a leap of faith and re-enter my current industry should I need to.

personalfinance,How to lower AGI to reduce student loan payments?,"Not sure if this is the best sub.  I searched past posts but I did not find anything since the new Trump Tax Cuts.  On mobile. Sorry for if poor formatting. 

 
My personal info:
-Married, filing separate.  Spouse has no student debt.
-1 dependent, 1 on the way (usually says to include unborn dependents in paperwork?)
-2017 W2 $75k
-Projected 2018 W2 90k
-$140,466 in federal sub and unsub loans at 5.88% average interest rate.  (This continues to grow b/c my payments do not cover the interest.)
-IBR payment plan $512.85/month.  Early borrower so they use 15% of my discretionary income.
-I live in FL
-I max out my 403b ($18,500)
-I am on track for PSLF (estimated elig date 02/21/2023)
 

Questions (and please correct me if I’m wrong):

1. Besides maxing out my 403b, what else can I do to lower my AGI? 
2. I am a federal government employee for the Veterans Affairs – does anyone know if a 457b offered?  Has anyone contributed to a 457b?  How does it differ from 403b?  I see it is for civil servants but I don’t see anything on the OPM website about it.
3. I don’t think I should do a high deductible health plan b/c I’m going to give birth in 4-5 months which rules out HSA. Right?
4. I don’t think we can contribute to traditional IRA to reduce my AGI further based on our income and filing status.  Any other options?

personalfinance,"Just noticed the local College offers a scholarship that rarely, if ever, actually pays anything to it's student's academics.","EDIT:  I see the typo in the post, can't fix it now.

So, how they're doing this is offering a scholarship that completely covers tuition for students who graduated locally.

E.G.  $4,400 Classes and books, comes down to $700 books for the semester

However, part of their enrollment process is applying for Federal Aid, and amounts are always subtracted from aid before the scholarship and the remainder is disbursed to the student.

Therefore, if a student gets $5,600 in Aid via pell grant and subsidized loan, then the costs of classes and books are covered by the grant and loan, and the remaining $1200 is disbursed to the student.  The scholarship in this example will pay $0.

The only way for the students to benefit from this system is to not accept any financial awards.  Almost every case is that the students go into debt for a measly $1200 to help them get by for a full semester.  Students could get tricked into going to this school on the false pretense of a scholarship, even though it's no different from any other school.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately and it's really making me sick.  Isn't there someone who can help these kids?

I had a major financial upheaval last year, my husband of a decade and the primary wage earner in our family decided he didn’t want to be a spouse or father any longer and just left. I looked up the addresses of food banks and paid my utility bill in coins and expected things would get a lot worse before they got better. Instead they just got better. Family stepped in to help me care for my young kids and I was able to pour myself in my business in a way I hadn’t been able to before. I have savings, little debt, my mortgage is small and manageable, and I own my vehicle outright but I’m not sure what to do from here. 

I bring in about $40,000+ CAD gross a year with my business and expect to grow by 30-50% next year. 
My business is/was expensive to run and required new equipment and some significant investment on my part this year so Net is just under $20,000 but is expected to be higher next year.

My Ex significantly reduced his work schedule and contributes $500/mo toward the children but I don’t know how much longer that will continue as he continues to work less and less. 

I receive around $1000 per month in CTB from the province. 

My mortgage is under $120,000 at a 2.7% interest rate, I have $4,500 in remaining school loan debt at 6.5%, $0 credit card debt and $14,000 in savings earning under 2%. 

I spend next to nothing on hobbies, vacations, meals out etc… and am good at thrifting. I have the funds to meet my needs and save $500 + every month. What I don’t have is a clue. 

I don’t have a retirement savings plan. 

My business is run from my home and I have already outgrown it, to grow I will need to purchase a new home in the next 2 years.

My vehicle is functional and necessary for my job but won’t likely last for more than another year or two.

personalfinance,"Switched Jobs, how do I pay for 401k Loan","I borrowed against myself on my 401k loan to pay off CC debt in a consolidated location. The way I understood it the interest rate was just putting more money into my 401k and I could stop paying transfer fees to move my CC debt around. However, I switched jobs recently and my 401k company is now telling me I must pay it off in full within 60 days.

I roughly need a 2 year $9,000 loan, but I want to get a good interest rate or borrow my own money again. I don't want to use up my emergency fund to pay off the loan. I have about $6,000 invested in my home that is appreciated approx. $10,000 since I purchased it.

My first idea other than getting a regular loan, is to get any loan just to pay off the 401k company, then roll over the funds into an IRA and borrow from the IRA. Then use that to pay off the former loan and resume payments like the 401k loan. So I would basically be back on the same plan I was on before, just under the IRA instead of the 401k. They won't let me roll over the funds until I pay off the loan of course, which is why I need the interim loan.

I went through a very materialistic stretch, that I'm finally starting to grow out of. Seeing that over the next 5 years I will be paying $15,000 in interest makes me sick, but this number will triple if I don't figure out a solid, accomplishable strategy.

personalfinance,Trying to plan wisely after a significant pay raise,"Short Version of Background Info:

I graduated from college about 4.5 years ago with about 150k in student debt (about 60% is federal on IBR and 40% is private). I also racked up about 10k of credit card debt due to car repairs and medical issues. I have also ran a side business for the past 4+ years that has consistently made me $200-500 a month and over that time the net profit margin has been around 18%.

&amp;#x200B;

Long Version of Background Info:

I graduated from college about 4.5 years ago with about 150k in student debt (about 60% is federal on IBR and 40% is private). I couldn’t find any work in my intended career field when I graduated so I got a job working at a factory for $12 an hour. A couple months before I graduated I knew I was going to have a difficult time finding a job so I took about $1500 of savings to start a business and that has been making me an extra $200-500 a month for the last few years and over that time the net profit margin has been around 18%. After being at this job for about 8 months I got a $2 pay raise , my own office and the ability to work on more projects that interested me. Despite working 60 hour work weeks, my side business and living with my parents for free I was still spending more money than I was making due to extra costs from constant repairs to my 17 year old car, student loans, and medical issues and racked up about $10k in credit card debt over that time. I still applied for about 2-3 jobs a day but was going nowhere finding a job, and took it upon myself to learn to code Python to make myself more competitive in the job market. I got to apply coding to my job and wrote enough code where I started applying for coding jobs. I eventually landed a job making $75k that utilized both my coding ability and a lot of knowledge/skills for my intended career field. Due to the increase in my IBR loan payments, moving to a higher cost city (and no more free rent), finally saving for retirement, and having to get a new car I still was not able to put too much in savings.  After having been at this job for 2+ years I got a pay raise to $118k.

&amp;#x200B;

My Plan:

After my recent pay raise I basically have an extra $1900 a month to do with as I wish. My idea right now is to find ways to A. Reduce the amount I’m paying in loans (either student or credit card) B. Increase the amount I’m saving for retirement C. Put more money into savings so I’ll eventually have 1-2 months of expenses in savings D. Continue to invest a modest amount in my side business as long as the net profit margin is above 10%. To do this I intend do the following:

1. My credit score has been sitting around 690+, though I have never missed a loan payment, I know the fact that my credit card has been practically maxed out for such long time has been driving my score down. I’d like to open a new credit card that has 0% APR for balance transfers for 15+ months, which means I’ll be putting more money into paying the balance versus interest and it should improve my credit score because my revolving credit would technically no longer be fully maxed out. I’ll also be paying an extra $1k a month to my credit card until it's paid off.
2. My job no longer offers 401k matching, plan now is start saving for retirement via a Roth 401k and increase my savings by about $500-600.
3. My credit score should increase within a few months thanks to #1 and once its in at least the low 700s I want to refinance my private student loans (some of which are at 10% interest), refinance calculators have shown that I should be paying $100-200 less in interest per month if I refinance. I do not intend to increase my student loan payments until my credit card is fully paid off.
4. Put an extra $300-400 a month directly into my savings account, start building my emergency funds.
5. Whatever extra I have at the end of the month I’ll invest in my side business, as long as the net profit margin continues to be above my loan interest.

Is there anything obvious that I’m missing, and are my priorities in the right order? Is my idea of opening a new credit card for the 0% APR balance transfer a crazy idea (I’ve only ever used credit cards to cover the cost of vital/emergency type of bills so I have no intention of using it in the future until it's paid off). I’m still trying to wrap my head around all of this, it's crazy to me that just a few years ago I was struggling to decide between eating or keeping my car running or paying for medical bills to where I am now. However, thanks to having been in that sort of situation I’m generally good about keeping and sticking to a budget. I’m sure my plan above will have to be somewhat flexible to match reality but I do want to stick as close to whatever plan I come up with as possible. Thanks to anyone that has helpful advice or suggestions.",finance

stocks,I am a bear convince me otherwise,"It's been nice reading all your posts. I created my account not too long ago and will try to be interactive and share my thoughts/opinions. 

As the title says I'm bearish. I see plenty of reasons for a bear market/recession but don't really see any compelling arguments as to why the longest bull run should continue. Can you convince me otherwise?

Why am I bearish? There are lots of reasons but the main is that we never suffered from the crisis of 08. We got into big trouble back then with too much debt and it started in housing and manifested itself all over the place. How did we solve it? Stimulus and QE (money printing). That't not a long term solution. To make matters worse we left interest rates so low for so long that it injected even more cheap money into our economy. Sure, those measures saved the economy temporarily, but now we are worse than 08. Americans are even more in debt and have less saved. With rising interest rates how are American's going to pay the interest on their debts? I don't think they will be able to. We will have to suffer greatly from the mess that started in 08 because the solution was not a sound one and only created the illusion of a strong economy.

This all leads me to believe a recession is coming or maybe even has already started. This will lead to big decline in US stocks as people will realize, just about all at once, that they are way overvalued.

personalfinance,Pay off my car loans or save for house down payment?,"Recently, I have changed jobs that resulted in moderate raise in my salary. In addition to the hike, I also have my internet and mileage reimbursed as I work from home; although the mileage reimbursement varies (rental is preferred to driving own car). At the end of each month, I may have anywhere from $200-$500 of reimbursements that goes into savings. So, at the end of the year, it could be anywhere from $2400 - $7200, depending on my travel.

SO and I will be buying a home in the next two years or so and have been going over the finances. Currently, the only loans we have are for 2 cars - $10K ($260/month) and $5K ($200/month) each, with 4 more years on each. We have no credit card debt, no student loans and no medical debt. We pay off every card and every bill in its entirety. Thanks to my new job, I am now able to save significant amounts into my emergency fund (15K), my kid's savings account (6K) along with an account set up for down payment (4K). 

Now, the additional savings in the form of the reimbursements ($200-$500) are now giving me an option to either pay off my car loans faster or use that money to pad our down payment. We are not sure which is a smarter option here. The car payments are low and easily affordable, but when we apply for a loan to buy a home, would having 2 car loans negatively effect our application? In that case, wouldn't it be smarter to have one less loan to worry about?

What do you guys think?

The 30% comes from an article I read online saying using more than 30% of your credit limit will hurt your credit score.

I know the mortgage rates have been increasing, so I've been worried about the rates so I did some research and found that Navy Federal is offering a 4.5% VA loan fixed rate for 30 years. We were told we can lock it in for 60 days for free but we're not sure when we're closing, so 60 days from now will be around end of January. So they gave us an option to do 90 days just to play it safe however, we need to pay a fee of $380. The thing is, if we go with navy federal, we would have to pay closing cost. But we would save about $150-$200 a month in our mortgage. What are your thoughts?

personalfinance,Student Loan Emergency: I think I was hoodwinked by Navient,"Guys I'm panicking right now. I'm fighting through tremor to type this coherently. Here is the situation:

At some point in May this year, I got a call from Navient to remind me to do something about my student loans. At the time, I was going through a rough patch financially, but I worked something out with them, or so I thought. I remember working out a payment plan, and we agreed that they take money from my bank account on the 27th of each month. We even agreed on an amount that they would be taking. I even provided my bank account details (I just now checked the website, and sure enough, I saw my bank account details there).

This is the insane part:

They tell me that I've been delinquent for a while now, so they reported me to the credit bureau. Thing is though, I go to check my Navient account, and my bank details are there, plain as day. They say it's my fault, even though I did everything they asked me to.

Now, you'd think they would've reached out in some way, shape, or form, but when I asked, the representative said they reached out by phone. I go to check my phone records, I see nothing from them. I tell him that, then I ask if I was notified of the delinquency. He says ""yes, we sent you email on xxxx dates. Trouble is, when I go to check, I see no email that even remotely hinted that my Navient account was in trouble. In fact, I even found one email that says ""Thank you for your payment"", at the end August. Also, side note, if anyone knows the time it takes before an account is delinquent, please tell me.

Moreover, they say they called me on two different dates, and I see no voicemails. They say they're not federally required to leave voicemails (which, wtf), fine. They say they sent emails about this. I see none. They never sent me a letter to my address either, which again, I think is reasonable to expect. 

Thing is now, because of someone's fuck up, my credit report is damaged. They say there's nothing they can do to fix it. Guys, is there anything I can do to make this go away? Please, any sound advice would be appreciated. Thank you!

I guess my first question is, should I do this? or should I apply for another credit card? This is the only ""credit"" I have, I don't really wanna go and open up credit cards I do not need. I like the card above because I have a 7k limit and I have a 765 credit score because of it. The 1% cash back just kinda sucks.

I want to move about 15k or so into a bank with a better interest rate.. Mine is only 0.3%.. I know. This I plan on being my savings, the 7k remaining or so will be my little emergency fund.

ACChain and Puyin Coin were ICO scams from China.

# Genevieve Leveille and Serena Yin

(admitted in own response and validated as the actual people and this is not a Doxing because they put their own names in the post and website etc) Leveille and Yin took control of the ACChain project around January 2018 around the time the original management fled but prior to the China arrests.

[https://bitcoinandblockchainfair.com/2018-speakers/](https://bitcoinandblockchainfair.com/2018-speakers/)

Leveille has widely claimed on social media and at blockchain events to have raised $23M into a new related venture called Biolifechain.io. The detail of biolifechain would never justify even a $2M presale so it was either a lie or part of a scheme to launder some of the ACChain or Puyin Coin missing funds.

[https://www.biolifechain.io/team](https://www.biolifechain.io/team)

Leveille set up 3 new UK companies plus one in the tax haven of Jersey, and information suggests a number of others in Switzerland, Hong Kong and probably elsewhere. These new companies were all set up at around the same time China police were investigating and making arrests

My original intention was to publish all the details we found online as a warning but the more I uncovered about this pair the more it looked like serious criminal activity that warrants a federal investigation probably in multiple countries. On top of obvious fraud and securities violations it seems to involve money laundering and tax evasion. I think it needs to be looked at urgently while they are still pushing that latest scam. No expectation of investors getting anything back but just stopping more people getting ripped off would be cool.

Leveille, Yin and a group of their supporters (being investigated now and **soon to be named and shamed)** are also clearly not satisfied with what they took so far and are starting and participating in at least 9, **yes NINE other ICO scams**.

I’m not sure who or where (8 possible locations) to report this and really need local legal advice... PLEASE HELP!

1- Genevieve Leveille and Serena Yin both appear or appeared to live, work or study in the UK at least partially, and Leveille is a director of many UK companies and two ICO’s and has addresses there. Doubtful they pay tax anywhere but UK should want to look at their tax.

2- Serena Yin appears to be Chinese national and the biggest scams were original China based. China police (Nanshan District, Shenzhen and later Beijing) are already be engaged and made arrests but our PI advised us with that amount of money Police may have likely been paid to turn a blind eye for some perpetrators.

3- There is a potential money trail leading to Jersey (UK, not NY one) and a company called “**ACChain Technology International Services”** and Genevieve Leveille uses a number of Jersey addresses so may live or work there. There also appears to be legal action against Leveille in Jersey based on a notice in Jersey papers

4- Genevieve Leveille claims a US passport holder or citizen and many things she did are crimes in the states but we have nothing to link her to a US address, no credit history or employment. She put Columbia University on linkedin but could not be verified or find any photo or anything so probably faked.

5- There are lawsuits against Genevieve Leveille in Singapore and two of her latest ICO Scams appear to be based in Singapore and there were notices in singapore papers too

6- Many of the ACChain and Biolifechain related companies link back to Hong Kong

7- One of her ICO’s seems to be Nigeria based and shes supposed to be from Nigeria but everyone knows the Nigeria police wont do shit.

8- The biolifechain ICO has many links and references to Switzerland and there have been a few pointers of money movement there.

All this has been uncovered with just a few grand for a private Investigator, a bit of searching and many tips from people that read the thread and chipped in. We probably only see the tip of the iceberg and there may be many more scams and ICO’s to find with a more effort.

# Full Background

Full disclosure, I got eyes on this shitshow because I invested a few grand in ACChain during the ICO phase mid 2017. I invest in a bunch of ICO’s lost that sort of money a dozen times I would normally not give a shit.

I took a close look of this first because of the fucked up responses they gave on Telegram when the project clearly had stalled or something wrong. Normally an exit scam completely disappear and a failed project will admit some difficulty. This was different. In July got invited to a private group of pissed off investors who showed evidence that valid questions were being censored and users blocked. It was clear something was getting covered up.

Since January 2018 it could be clearly seen in GIT (the public source code repository) that **no development** was going on, the team listed on the website apart from Leveille had not been seen or heard of in public for months, but social media kept posting that the project was still going strong and claiming faked awards and other stuff. There was no mention of anyone leaving, any trouble, hacking, nothing.They always said “there will be a new release in a few weeks the developers are hard at work” but this shit went on for over 6 months and you could see its a lie because nothing in GIT and nobody trading it.

What really pissed me is the arrogant and dismissive way Leveille and her admin Robin dealt with investors. Frequently deleting critical posts and in one case referring to someone that asked questions as ***“he is a small little man who should not have invested what he could ill afford to loose”***. Well fuck that attitude when you’re living high off the guys money, so in June I dropped a few grand to get a Hong Kong PI to find out what really happened.

The PI connected Puyin Coin owners directly to ACChain via a string of China and HK companies, found the offices which were hastily evacuated got photos, got a bunch of other details on the original team and other evidence clearly showing it all to be a multi part scam. Can read a lot more detail in the other posts.

The PI did warn us that they were **threatened by mafia like people** in the course of this investigation. There is well over $60M USD taken so it is very likely some people they do not want to be uncovered and may have bribed China police already. The PI seriously advised us and the other investors to remain anonymous and avoid China.  Consider the threats to be very serious even life threatening and this comes from a proper PI.

I shared some the information I had with the investors and posted on reddit and **then things got interesting**…

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/94hoqb/acchain\_office\_photo\_exit\_scam/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/94hoqb/acchain_office_photo_exit_scam/)

When the first empty office photos were posted (which are exactly the register China company offices) the ACChain Telegram admins (Wallace and Robin) tried to claim it was all FAKE NEWS and strongly insisted that the project was still going but could not substantiate a thing they said. When investors quizzed the ACChain social media team they were evasive or just blocked or censored the investor.

This was so fucked up because they were clearly caught red handed, but they kept trying to keep the scam going for unknown reasons. Days later under pressure to give any evidence they finally posted old photos of the development team “at work” as their “proof”. Turned out (own admission) the social media team had never been to China or seen the actual office, they just got paid by Leveille and Yin to keep the social media going and had no connection to the devs or anyone.

In the photo, our PI identified one former employee that they had interviewed in person, she had left ACChain in 2017, so the photo they were using as “proof” was old and proved the opposite. They were trying too hard to keep the cover up.

Investors challenged the ACChain team to refute any of this with real evidence and they always got censored or blocked. ACChain were asked to post a video or anything to back up their story which would be so fucking easy if anything they said was true.

The photos of the scammers and more of the details the PI dug up were then posted on reddit and got a lot of attention and thousand plus upvotes.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/95kqvh/acchain\_exit\_scam\_blacklist/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/95kqvh/acchain_exit_scam_blacklist/)

Then rather than disappear **Genevieve Leveille doubled down again**…

ACChain posted a hurried ‘explanation’ on medium on August 10 and paid for it to be republished on a few blockchain websites, they try to say the details posted on reddit were factually incorrect and they tried to put up a cover story. But they gave no evidence other than a story, and if what they say is true it would be so easy to back it up with evidence.

[https://twitter.com/GinouInLondon/status/1027979409763061761](https://twitter.com/GinouInLondon/status/1027979409763061761) Leveille posted on twitter and even said this

“[\#Vote](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vote?src=hash) up this article [\#help](https://twitter.com/hashtag/help?src=hash) put to [\#shame](https://twitter.com/hashtag/shame?src=hash) [\#cowards](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cowards?src=hash) get the [\#truth](https://twitter.com/hashtag/truth?src=hash)\-out”

This explanation was transparent as fuck. It was immediately debunked and only sunk them deeper. A cover story intended to fool anyone that didn’t know the real ACChain history.

1- claimed

&gt;""From January 2018 the business started formally restructuring”

management changed and Genevieve Leveille and Serena Yin claim they were brought in to lead the global development strategy.Obvious coverup because there was no mention of any restructure at the time in January. All through 2018 they claimed the opposite. the key people were due at events (no evidence) and team were still at work (with no updates on GIT)So this is perhaps the only explanation they could make up after the scam was exposed. If it was a restructure then why not get the original team to announce it, oh yeah because they’re **in Jail or hiding from police**.

2- claimed

&gt;“ACChain was working with a reduced team when a cyber-attack took place in April 2018”

and they were investigating and refunding coins.This was never admitted back in April, so if it did happen they covered it up for 3 months. A lot of people on telegram did claim missing coins but they did not get any explanation and the questions were censored or deleted. The way coins were taken clearly pointed to an inside job as it had access to wallet keys, so it was probably the original team coming back to raid the coffers or Levelle and Yin taking it themself.

3- Claimed

&gt;“hundreds of thousands of voters who voted for ACChain to win the Chainnews 2018 Blockchain Star award in Asia”.

**This is not possible**. Hundreds of thousands voting has NEVER happened in a blockchain competition. Why would a largely unknown coin get so many votes? Obviously, they paid for the award or used bots or a script to cheat the system.Either way trying to validate themselves with this and the IDAXC was clearly desperation.

4- Claimed

&gt;“In January 2018, ACChain also received accreditation from IDAXC — the global decentralized digital asset management organisation”

Which turns out to be a non-existent organization with website under construction. [http://idaxc.org/](http://idaxc.org/)Why post a fake organization as validation when you’re trying to clear your name?

[**http://cryptonews.ovh/acchain-releases-a-statement-deny-any-wrong-doing-blame-fake-news/**](http://cryptonews.ovh/acchain-releases-a-statement-deny-any-wrong-doing-blame-fake-news/)

If you google ACChain you see that most of the media picked up the real story and exposed the scam, except ONE

[https://medium.com/@regit000/acchain-fud-attack-reveals-cannibalistic-nature-of-reporting-in-the-crypto-space-ae5b3a28bb68](https://medium.com/@regit000/acchain-fud-attack-reveals-cannibalistic-nature-of-reporting-in-the-crypto-space-ae5b3a28bb68) Based on the fact that he shilled them before and knows the real background this one conrary post by **Bob Welldon** would indicate ***Bob is complicit in the SCAM*** or intentionally helping them cover it up. He seem to be assisting them in other ways too.

A few days after posting on medium all communication from ACChain stopped. It appears the social media team finally figured out they we’re being scammed too.

What all the investors and now the crypto world could not understand is why after the scam had clearly been uncovered did Genevieve Leveille and Serena Yin go to such effort to try to keep the scam going.

Thanks to the original telegram article a lot of people helped answer that too.

**Genevieve Leveille is involved in at least 9 other ICO scams** and she is flying around the world speaking at events pushing them as much as possible. It suggest she is trying to c*ash out all these other scams as quickly as she can before the ACChain story and her history gets too widely known*. She may be a few months away from disappearing forever back to Nigeria or wherever so got to get her investigated quick.

Most of these are scams they have not raised significant amounts and done nothing. Themis has some real technology and seems to be raising tens of millions and there is the feel of ACChain about it. Themis refused to comment about how deeply involve Leveille and got evasive about her involvement then removed reference to her. Themis might be the legitimate one of the 9 but this should be enough to avoid them. Themis just removed all the adviser names from their whitepaper so maybe a way to quietly distance themselves from Leveille. The **waybackmachine** never forgets though.

The PI could find little background information on Serena Yin like a ghost they said, Genevieve Leveille appears to have a history of scams and crime long before she became involved in ICO scams. The PI found newspaper notices regarding legal action for IP violations and securities fraud in papers in Singapore, UK and Jersey from July to September 2017.

A person claiming to be her former co-worker from a bank in the UK said that around October 2017 Leveille was desperately trying to borrow money from anyone to her to pay legal costs claiming she was victim of people ripping her off but soon she was coming into big money. A few months later she was living the high life and pretty clear she learned how to do ICO scams.

Leveille is supposed to be a US Citizen of Nigerian origin.  Leveille frequently still claims to be founder of UK company 0tentic8 Ltd which Leveille and a partner Duane Gafoor of Hong Kong incorporated in December 2016 and dissolved in August 2017.

[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10539052](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10539052)

Despite having dissolved 0tentic8 Leveille still claims everywhere to be ""CEO 0tentic8"" or ""CEO AgriLedger"" in her profile and at events (Seems she left AgriLedger in 2016)

My side is pretty cut and dry I think; buying a bond means you will net profit.  His side is more complicated; the town will raise taxes in order to pay the bond back, and since we live in the town our taxes will go up.  He believes that we will net negative if we buy into the bond, spend money there, only to have to spend more in tax dollars than the bond will net out.  

Obviously, you don’t know the interest rate on the bond or how much or even if the taxes will increase.  However, I’m wondering if y’all can give some input on this.",finance

personalfinance,Frustration With Student Loan Situation [Need Guidance],"I am having a very difficult time with my student loan which is currently in default. I have made consecutive payments however, the company that holds my defaulted status is giving a hard time and holding back from placing my loan back into good standings. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its a federal student loan which was originally around 20k. I was contacted by National Recoveries who was contracted by the Dept of Education to resolve defaulted loans. \[I shamefully ignored the initial letters and allowed the loan to default by not returning their calls\]. I was planning to get married and knew house hunting was on the way. NR called me one day to resolve the debt in Feb so I was willing to work to get it fix. 

&amp;#x200B;

NR informed me that I had to make 9 qualifying payments in a 10 month period to get my loan back into good standings. I can't recall for sure but I believe I talked to the rep on the phone about my income and she was able to base a payment for me to get started. NR then FedEx me a document to sign and send back to be enrolled in their rehabilitation program. All my payments however where done of the Dept of Education website \[[myeddept.gov](https://myeddept.gov)\]  

&amp;#x200B;

My payments were going fine until I called to see if I could obtain a copy of my agreement. About 4 months into the qualifying payments I was now married. Our Realtor requested a copy of the agreement so he could try to work out something with the bank for a loan. I sadly blurted out about the recent merge to the rep on the phone with NR. The company then raised my minimum payment based on dual income. 

&amp;#x200B;

Submitting my 9th payment I called the NR to see what next steps were for getting my loan back into good standings. They informed myself that I only had 2 qualifying payments so far. I freaked out. The rep with NR informed me that because I got married my payments went up. This disqualified all previous payments I made while I was single. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. They kept saying my payments are based on current information and that my date of marriage didn't factor into this.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am at a lost. I don't know what to do and how this is ever possible. I've been making my payments each month however this company has this strangle hold my on wife and myself future by holding my debt in default. Maybe this is how it is and I am just uninformed. I called some lawyers who said unless I declaring bankruptcy they can't aid in this matter. A non profit I also contacted was confused by this situation. He also informed me that there was little he could provide for help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reaching out to you all here to see if there something you could help out with. Loan stands around 12k currently. My payments are about $350. I can make the payments comfortably. I called Dept of Ed to complain about my situation with NR. They submitted a complaint. I also asked them what would they be willing to settle the debt at. Dept of Ed said I had to talk to NR about that. NR stated that they are showing a balance of 15K and they can only offer a settlement of 11K.

personalfinance,Review my next investment step?,"A little background info:

* 24 yo
* No debt
* Relatively new car (not expecting to buy soon)
* Taking 3% 401k match
* Maxed out Roth IRA
* Maxed out HSA
* ~10 month emergency fund in HYSA (1.9% APY)

I am looking for the next step in my investment plan. Since I want to save for a possible house down-payment (assuming 20% down payment on say... $250k house -- $50k) or car 3-5 years down the road, I figured it's best to keep that money in low risk areas. That being said, I feel that letting it sit in the HYSA is a wasted opportunity. I'm assuming 20% down payment on $250k house, so $50k. Here are the options I was considering:

[NavyFed Special Easy Start CD](https://www.navyfederal.org/products-services/checking-savings/certificates.php)

* 1 year term, 3% APY, $3,000 max. Seems like one of, if not *the*, best deals out there currently. Thinking about maxing out this offer.

[I-bonds/EE-bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm)

* I-bonds seem like a very safe investment as they protect from rising inflation rates. Also, after a year you can pull out at any time and only lose 3 months of interest (no penalty after 5 years). I was thinking of slowing transitioning a portion of emergency fund over there (not sure what percentage, but it seems like people have done 100% before and had no problem transferring when the time came).

Any advice on these two options or other ideas as to where I should be investing my money for near term?",finance
personalfinance,Thinking about taking out a personal loan for debt consolidation,"Hey everyone.

So I was considering taking out a personal loan for debt consolidation. Basically my debts boil down to

10K student loans

~3.5K credit card debt

5K car loan

I know this is not a large amount of debt, however, because of the interest payments on my credit cards and the fact that my car just shit the bed on me and needs a good amount of work (~3.5Kish) and I don't have the savings to fix it.

I know that this amount of work is more than half of what my car loan is, and for my area the car is worth about 11K (or it would be once it was all fixed and in good condition).

I was considering taking out a personal loan in the 22K range, which even with the maximum interest rates and payments would only come out to about $571 per month, which is much less than what I'm paying per month with the credit card interest rates. I believe that due to the fact that I have a decent credit score (700ish) I will be able to secure a better interest rate which will probably lower my monthly payments.

With this loan, I will have a fully working car again, I would no longer be stressing out about making multiple individual payments. I'm hoping to get some insight on whether or not this is a good idea and why.

Thanks a bunch.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

After some not so intelligent decisions I landed myself in a small hole and I would really like to get out of it as quickly as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have 3 different loans each with different values and timeframes. My country has some insane interest rates so it's very disheartening but I have little choice here.

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 1 

$6000 paid in 12 months

monthly payments of 793,52 (9522.24 after 12 months)

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 2

$4600 paid in 12 months

monthly payments of 611,65  (7339.80 after 12 months)

&amp;#x200B;

Loan 3

$4000 paid in 48 months

monthly payments of 211.36 (10145.28 after 48 months)

&amp;#x200B;

All of these will have significantly lower interest if paid off early

&amp;#x200B;

Currently for the next 12 months I have a monthly payment of 1616.53 in just the loans.

&amp;#x200B;

My current situation is as follows - I bring in $4400 per month after taxes. I live in a shared apartment and my rent + utilities come to roughly $2200. At this rate, not a lot is left to try to save up to get rid of my debt. I do have one option which would mean losing comfort for a bit of time but may be the smartest option. I could live with my parents rent free (although, doing this would mean that I would be sort of ""betraying"" my current roommates and could be seen as a dick move) and have only a $200 per month for a few bills.

personalfinance,Company not matching 401k even though policy says they will.,"My company has a 401k match. I noticed a few weeks ago that the match had not been applied the entire year (shame on me for not checking sooner). I asked the benefits team and I got an odd response. they say that because I started in 2017, the 2018 401k policy does not apply to me and that I must follow the 2017 401k standards and wait one year before getting the company match . The 2018 401k policy states that all employees get a company match immediately and that if you were hired prior to 2018 it is fully vested, otherwise it will take two years to vest. The issue that I have is that I was not eligible to start my 401k until 1/1/2018 AND the 2018 policy does not have any stipulation on eligibility other than you must be 21 and a full time employee, which I am. What options do I have here?

&amp;#x200B;

To add some more info:

&amp;#x200B;

This is from the plan documentation overview-""The  purpose  of  the  plan  is  to  enable  eligible  Employees  to  save  for  retirement.  As  well  as  retirement  benefits,  the  plan provides certain benefits in the event of death, disability, or other termination of employment.  The Plan is for the exclusive benefit of eligible Employees and their Beneficiaries.""

And this is from the plan documentation around eligibility-

""A.Eligibility RequirementsYou are eligible to participate in the Plan if you are an Employee.However, you are not eligible to participate if you are:•a resident of Puerto Rico

a leased Employee

•Temporary Employees  However, if you are in the group(s) listed below, you shall become eligible to participate in

the  plan  on  the  first  entry  date  after  you  have  reached  age  21  and  have  completed  at  least  1,000  Hours of Service

•Temporary Employees

You are also not eligible to participate if you are an individual who is a signatory to a contract, letter of agreement, or other document that acknowledges your status as an independent contractor not entitled to benefits under the Plan and you are not otherwise classified by the Employer as a common law employee or the Employer does not withhold income taxes, file Form W-2 (or any replacement form), or remit Social Security payments to the Federal government for you, even if you are later adjudicated to be a common law employee.

You will become eligible to participate in the Plan according to the table below:

........

Employer Matching contributions-

Age requirement 21

service requirement-None

Entry Date- First date of each month""

The plan also states that those hired prior to 2018 will be fully vested upon match and not have the 2 year vesting period.

&amp;#x200B;

Does that help clarify? or is there another document besides the plan summary overview I should be checking?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! This has been incredibly helpful. to clarify, the payout for employer match should be every pay period, which is two weeks. The plan is also through Fidelity. I will be contacting Fidelity today and possibly the Department Of Labor if I need to. the reason that this match is such a big deal is that it is a 50% match up to 6% of my total paycheck. Half of the 50% match is in company stock. which tripled from low 30s to low 100s from the start of the year to now. I maxed out my 401k believing I was getting this match and it equates to almost 10k missing due to the stock exploding.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Called Fidelity today. According to the plan information on file, I should have been getting this match all year long. I was told to speak with the plan administrator that works at my company, I got an email confirmation of this info from Fidelity. I am reaching out to them later today, with this information and will see what they say.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

Hi!, my name is Victor and I'm from Venezuela, my dad knows that I'm into technology in general, so when a friend from his work invited him to the next ""big thing in Cryptocurrency"" and that he cannot ""miss out in this big business opportunity"" A couple of flags were raised, but I decided to go with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter ""Forcount"", the meeting was in the city's country club with over 100+ people, a couple of close friends were there, I was immediately congratulated because I was not missing out on the next big thing in Crypto, even bigger flags were raised, I told my dad 

$Victor -Watch this being this big ass pyramid scheme 

$Dad -I don't think so, Mr. BigBucks, and Ms.ChainOwner is here.

&amp;#x200B;

And he was right, well-off people were there, people with money, shop owners, dealership owners, people from wealthy families, so I was a little suspicious about that, anyways I went a took sit while my dad was talking with the girl that invited him, he came back I asked what she said. 

$Victor -So, what did she said to you? something along the lines that you will love this, and cannot miss this business opportunity? 

$Dad -Yeah pretty much that.

$Victor -This is going to be a big ass pyramid. 

$Dad -Probably, listen, the presentation is starting. 

So then he came, this ""Black diamond rank"" guy from Costa Rica, to give us the presentation, he started by cheering everyone up telling a couple jokes and give a round of applause to this guy from our city because he just reached the ""Emerald"" ranking. 

The presentation began, he started talking about how no believed in the internet and in social media, how companies were going bankrupt because they were stuck in their old ways. bla bla bla, yada yada yada, everything about that was true. he talked about how if you invested in apple x years ago you should have been richer you can imagine, but no-one believed in Steve Jobs, because he was this crazy tech guy with crazy ideas, and then... he said, let me present your next opportunity to be rich af boi and how to have a rich guy mentality. 

Introducing ""Forcount""

He began talking about this company that started in 2015 ([even tho the domain was registered in 2017](https://who.is/whois/forcount.com)) specialized in ""cryptocurrency trading"" Big quotes here, he said that the company has the best traders in the world and how can they work for you, using their investment plans!. He then gave a brief intro to cryptocurrency (Litecoin) how can you be your bank yada yada... 

and then oh boy, he began explaining the investment plans, how Litecoin used to be worh $3 and had an ATH of $100 and how in december it was expected to go over $1000.

&amp;#x200B;

So the investments plans are pretty much an ""interest rate"" from 0.01% to 3% from the profits made by their world-class traders make on your investment.

I started working with a friend giving people basic courses about crypto (what's a wallet how to use it, what's a whitepaper) and in the course there were a couple attendees that invested in ShitCount, I showed them John Oliver video on MLMs and they told me they want to get their Litecoins and DASH out of that shit. and surprise surprise, you cannot withdraw your funds, only after 3 months and you can only withdraw the profits made with your investment, boy they were pissed. 

A couple weeks pass by and news came, the Puerto Rican Black diamond was leaving the company, the Emerald local guy is under fire from everyone because they can't withdraw funds and is now exit scamming to Spain.

And now everytime that I talk about someone about Crypto they think is about that forcount shit because everyone thinks I want to recruit them to my ""network"". 

on the plus side, a lot more people are interested in crypto general and informing themselves about it. Here's a pic from the last course we taught!.

personalfinance,Mortgage loan program to pay off student loan,"Maryland has a mortgage program called Smartbuy 2.0 that provides a 5 year forgivable loan to pay off your student loans up to 15% of the purchase price of the home, limited to $40,000. At least one of the borrowers must have no student debt remaining after the benefit.

My partner and I (both 25) are considering utilizing the loan program to pay off her student loan debt and after 5 years probably sell the home. We would be looking to utilize a $17,000 grant from her employer that can be used for closing costs/down payment assistance for homes near her work, as well as possibly a $5,000 deferred loan from the State for down payment assistance. We could also sell a car as she could walk to work and I could easily commute via public transportation.

My partner has paid off just under $35,000 in student loan debt since May 2016, and has about $45,000 remaining. I have under $17,000 in student loans, but my employer pays them as a benefit.

We were not looking to purchase a house for a few years, as the priority had been to eliminate her student loan debt. She refinanced her private loans two years ago from \~10% interest rates to 4.75%.

Both our credit scores are 750+ but the interest rate is specific for the program and has been between 5.75 - 6% (currently 6%)

Details:

Combined annual income: **$85,000** \- both stable jobs. (I have a side job as a soccer referee and expect to make about $5000 in profit but this would not be counted as income due to not having two years of tax returns.)

Monthly Debts:

Two car payments at 0% 3 years remaining - **$499** monthly  
Credit card payment: **$25** monthly  
My Federal Student Loan: $16,922 @ 4.65% - **$0** monthly (technically shows up as $149, but my employer pays between $200 - 500 monthly)  
Her Private Student Loan:  $31,784.00 @ 4.75% - **$624.91** monthly  
Her Federal Student Loans: $14,154.17 @ 3.15% - **$96.09** monthly

Current Rent: $**1175 monthly**, lease ends May 2019

Savings: We each have E-funds of $5000, and would try to purchase and close on a home utilizing only grant money.  I have about $6,000 in my retirement, $2000 in an HSA, and contribute 5% to meet the maximum employer match. She does not contribute to her 403b as her employer contributes 3% of her salary regardless of her contribution.

Does this seem like something we should pursue? Purchase a home around $268,000 to receive the maximum of $40,000 for the student loan benefit and pay off about $5000 to get to $40k. We would be putting 5% for the down payment as required by the program.",finance
solar,Solar In Michigan: One Year Later,"I wanted to write a breakdown of the detailed financial costs of installing residential rooftop solar in Michigan because I hear from many people that they assume solar is not cost effective in northern climates. I had my solar system installed more than 1 year ago, so I can now use the real-world data from my installation to show that solar is, in fact, way cheaper than buying energy from the grid.

Bottom Line: Solar power, when amortized over the life of the system, costs ***less than half*** what I would normally pay if buying my power from the grid. Solar is cost effective, even in a snowy northern climate like Michigan. For the details, keep reading.

Disclaimer: When projecting energy costs out 25 years, I had to make some assumptions regarding longevity of my system, as well as the assumption that grid energy costs will stay fixed or will increase. I am not a fortune teller, so I used what I thought were reasonable assumptions, biased toward simplicity. 

The details:

I have a 14.4 kw system (48 panels) installed on a rooftop configuration in SE Michigan. They are American made panels with a 3rd party 25 year warranty. I am using SolarEdge inverters, which are highly regarded in terms of quality, and they have a 10 year warranty. I directly sell all excess power to DTE via net metering, so no batteries are used.

My system cost $38,934, which was slightly higher than normal because of excessive trenching and some permitting issues with an unfriendly township. After the federal tax credit of 30%, my total out of pocket costs were $27,253. For the purposes of this calculation, I am assuming a total system life of 25 years (the total warranty period for the panels, although many people anecdotally report that panels can last much longer than 25 years). 

From Sept 2017 to Sept 2018 (365 days) my real world production was 17,054 KwH, or appx 46.7 KwH per day. If I were to directly extrapolate this production over 25 years, that results in a lifetime production of 426,350 KwH. (Sidenote: Solar panel production does degrade slightly over time, so this may be an unfair assumption, but I am using it for the sake of simplicity.)

Taking the total system cost divided by total production, (27,253/426,350), we get an amortized cost per KwH of about 6.3 cents. 

DTE has a rather complicated [pricing scheme](https://newlook.dteenergy.com/wps/wcm/connect/23195474-a4d1-4d38-aa30-a4426fd3336b/WholeHouseRateOptions.pdf?MOD=AJPERES), but generally customers will pay between 13.26 to 14.79 cents per KwH, and if history is any guide, those prices will likely go up over time, whereas my lump sum costs are fully paid. 

Some other notes: My system is suboptimal for two reasons. First, I was unable to use ground mounts as originally intended because of township zoning issues. Ground mounts would enable me to have a more advantageous angle, less shading issues, and I could sweep the snow off them in winter if I wanted. With my roof mount, the angle is a little shallower than optimal, and I cannot sweep the snow off, so my production goes to 0 for several weeks in winter. Second, my roof mount configuration required more trenching than originally planned, which increased the price.

According to [NREL data](https://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/pubs/redbook/PDFs/MI.PDF), my area should produce around 4.2 peak sun hours per day on average. However, due to shading and snow issues, I am only getting around 3.2. I bring this up to show that even under suboptimal conditions, solar is still very cost effective, even in a snowy Michigan climate.",energy
personalfinance,Parents want me to use new house as collateral for student loan debt?,"My fiance (M26)  and I (F26) bought a $175k house in August of this year.  We put down $20k. I have $77k in private student loans ( I know I was stupid and young and am paying for it now.)  We bought a house because renting where we live would have cost as much as a our current house payment.

Basically my mom, who is the cosigner, does not help pay the student loans and has said she will not help me pay and wants to be removed as the cosigner. I have never missed a payment and have never asked for help financially from her or my dad. My fiance also doesn't want to help pay for my student loans which is a discussion for another time.

I have been wanting to refinancing my student loans to get a lower interest rate but am having difficulty getting approved because my mom and fiance don't want to be a cosigner. I have been working really hard to improve my credit and have a score of 686. Is putting a house as collateral a good idea or would it be trading one problem for another? I don't really understand how it works, can I even use the house as collateral?

I don't think my parents have good financial sense and struggle to know if what they are saying is a good idea long term.

Is there someone at a bank or somewhere that I should talk to, to go over the nitty gritty of my loans and my options?

personalfinance,Short term investments for a house?,"Hello!

My wife and I are currently renting  in a medium cost of living area in Wisconsin and plan to either buy or build in 2 - 5  years.  We are currently focusing on saving as much as we can and would  like to pay at least 50% down, but frankly we are in no rush to buy and  if we can pay all cash, we will.  Neither of us has any debt (no more student loans, we share a car and it was paid in full, always pay our credit cards off in full and on time).  We do not have children and do not plan to have them.  We live quite frugally, but do not deprive  ourselves.  We are both 34 years old.  We are generally able to save  about 4-5k per month.  (Household income is around 140k per year before  taxes.)  I have a 401k through my company.

At  the moment, we have around $90,000 saved between two CDs and a money market.  One of the CDs is maturing this week and the other CD was  started at a very low interest rate 8 months ago (1.49%), so we are  thinking of taking the money out of that one and combining it with the  CD that's maturing, and then start a new CD with a larger amount at the  current rate (2.62%).  (Our credit union does not have any penalty fees for ending the CD early that cut into the principal - I believe the penalty is that you lose the interest made over the last 180 days, which at this point, is only about $200.)  

Our money market requires a minimum balance of 10k, but we are thinking to keep at least 15k or 20k in it as an emergency fund.  If we keep 20k in the money market, we have 70k to play with in CDs (or some other type of  low risk investment - this is our house money, we do not want to be  risky with it).  Do you think that the rates will continue to go up for CDs?  The 2.62% rate is for a period of 19 months (credit union has a  special right now) - this is the highest rate they have for any of their CDs.  Do you think we should put the full 70k into one CD at 2.62% or maybe just put in 40k or 50k now at 2.62% and see where the rates are in  a few months, then put the rest into another CD, along with money we  have saved in the meantime?  Or is there some other type of low-risk  investment that you recommend?  We want the money to be available within  2 - 5 years.

Neither of us has any debt.  Our goal right now is not necessarily to make a load of money, but more so to not lose money due to inflation.  The rates for savings accounts are  abysmal (0.03%), thus why we are keeping money in either the money  market or CDs.  We do not want to be paying for a house for 15 to 30  years and end up paying essentially twice the price for it because of  interest, thus the current focus on saving.  Also, we really do not know much about the stock market and are therefore very uncomfortable about investing this money in stocks.

Any advice would be great!  Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Grad student with no/minimal income - should I pay off my car loan or stay liquid?,"Hi All, 

This is my first post here, so hopefully I've followed all the rules. 

I am 2 months into a 16 month program (Master's degree in nursing). I live with my parents. My set monthly expenses are: 

**Car loan**: $338 w/2.99% interest rate, $10k remaining 

**Car Insurance**: $125-136/month 

**Pet insurance**: $80 (necessary, my dog requires meds that are $250 for a 50-day supply, and she is prone to ear infections, is genetically prone to back issues that would be about $5k to fix)

**Hulu**: $12

**Gas**: $30-50 (my grandma pays 50-70% of this)

Variable expenses (caveat, I am terrible at budgeting, I KNOW I need to work on this, I am also an emotional spender and need to get that under control too). 

**Groceries**: ~$200/month
 
**Eating out**: ~$50/month 

**Whatever else comes up**: ~$100-200/month 

**Income**: variable, $300-600/month. I work for my grandma as her healthcare coordinator. I babysit. I am looking into tutoring. I am working on side hustles, but my program is very accelerated - I can't really commit to even a scheduled part-time job and maintain the required GPA and clinical hours. 

**Savings**: $10k in high interest AmEx savings, $2k in traditional savings//about $1k in checking right now. 

**Student Loan Debt**: (I don't really want to address this, I have a very aggressive plan for paying it back once I graduate - I'm pretty comfortable with my ability to do so, but thought I would include for a full picture): Current: approx: $48k, expected total: approx: $80k

Obviously I am in the hole, but I am in grad school. I am okay with taking out student loans to pay for necessities (groceries, insurance, etc.) but this car loan is killing me. Also, my expenses are eating into my savings. I am very attached to my savings. I have ALWAYS paid my bills in full every month, with something leftover for saving. This is the first time in my life that my expenses outweigh my income. 

I am lucky enough that my parents are offering my a 0%, $10-15K  loan. I literally took out enough in government loans to cover tuition &amp; fees and nothing else. I am leaning heavily to taking $15k from my parents, paying off my car, and using the remaining $5k to pay for my set monthly expenses over the next 14 months.

   Car paid off. 
   Credit cards always paid in full. 
    40k in student loan debt ( originally 70k)
    No mortgage, we rent 
We used to take home about 10,000 more/year before baby was born/ below crisis. I want to stay home as long as possible. 

This past spring I was diagnosed with epilepsy after a series of seizures. Prior to this I had a small day care in my home. I was not comfortable continuing this as I was alone with babies (including my own) all day. Luckily I’ve been seizure-free for 5 months since I began medication, but I don’t feel right about taking care of other children at this time. I’m sure that will be in the future again, but I need to know I’ve been seizure-free for at least a year. 

So our income decreased drastically during that time as well as having to pay for a few thousand worth of medical bills. I found a job teaching ESL online PT in the early morning and evening while baby is asleep. I’m not making what I was before, but it’s definitely enough. We were able to get through those difficult months (both emotionally and financially) without using CCs, but we depleted our cash savings. 

A few things....

1) It’s so hard to see that liquid savings gone. I know it was there for emergencies (which we had!) and we used it for a good purpose. Still , it’s hard to see that deplete and know I may not be able to contribute as much for the time being. We have around $1000 back in that account and slowly increasing but it still feels awful. If I were to have another medical crisis, I feel like we’d drown. 

2) I started watching Dave Ramsey and feel so conflicted about these student loans. After college, we did tons of research and decided to continue to invest fairly aggressively and pay off the loans slower. The interest rates range from 4-6%. After hearing Ramsey’s advice, I feel even more overwhelmed. I thought we were doing well and felt really comfortable until the medical crisis and now my questioning of our debt vs investing strategy. Did we totally screw up?",finance

* I have about $13,000 in interest-free debt right now on two different credit cards. This was obviously not planned and I have been chipping away at it but it's hard because I'm pretty much living paycheck to paycheck at the moment so that's where we are.

* I have a loan for $5,200 with a 5.95% interest rate. I pay $78 towards this loan every 2 weeks, which is above the minimum.

The question: 

* I got a refund of over $1,600. My plan was to put that directly to my loan since that's the one with interest BUT now I'm thinking I should either 1) put that towards the large payment due in February or 2) use it to my my current credit card bill, which is about double my normal bill due to those aforementioned unexpected expenses.

I have $20,000 saved. $20,000 car loan at 1% interest (monthly car payment is 405.00). no other debt.

Husband has $0 saved. $40,000 in school loans at 4-6% interest(monthly payment of 400.00) and around $4000 in credit card debt.

We have a combined income of $126,000. Both have been at our jobs long term since graduation in 2011.

We are currently paying monthly: $1850.00 rent and approx $450.00 in bills.

We found a condo in Anaheim we like for $400,000 +350.00/month HOA fee.

We found financing using FHA loans at an interest rate of 4.87%. 

Loan is structured as follows: We will leave 14K as a down payment, and closing costs should be around $8,000.  We also have to pay PMI for the entirety of the loan, this comes out to $275.00/month. They calculate our monthly payment to be $3210.00 which includes principal and interest, homeowners insurance, taxes, PMI, and hoa. 

Our hope is to buy this condo and sell in 3 years. We don't expect a huge gain but at least to not give away so much in rent. 

A rough estimate we have is that after the mortgage, bills, car and loan payments we should still have $2360.00 to live and invest off of. Essentially that would only be for gas and food, emergency and saving/investing.

We first thought to buy a home for tax purposes but it doesn't seem that will help too much, please correct me if i am wrong. If you don't think i should buy a condo now what would you suggest i do that may either help with taxes or bring in more than the 2% that banks offer i put 20K in savings.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Ex-Bitcoin Skeptic Ron Paul Says Crypto Could Prevent Recession,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/9z1z7ayh0mv11.png

Retired US Congressman Ron Paul, a one-time bitcoin skeptic, called for a tax exemption on all cryptocurrencies, saying the move could prevent an economic recession.

Ron Paul, the father of current United States Senator Rand Paul, made the suggestion in a [blog post](http://www.ronpaullibertyreport.com/archives/trump-is-right-the-fed-is-crazy) entitled “Trump Is Right, the Fed Is Crazy,” where he blasted the Federal Reserve for manipulating interest rates.

“It is likely that the next Fed-created recession will come sooner rather than later,” Paul wrote. “This could be the major catastrophe that leads to the end of fiat currency.”

Paul said the only way to avoid such a crisis is to allow people to use alternative currencies and to exempt “all transactions in precious metals and cryptocurrencies from capital gains taxes and other taxes.”

## Fed Manipulation Causes ‘Illusion Of Prosperity’

Paul said central banks constantly increase and decrease the money supply to control the economy by controlling interest rates.

He said the [Federal Reserve](http://ccn.com/tag/federal-reserve)‘s cyclical manipulation of interest rates actually fuels recessions by creating an artificial economic boom.

“This can create an illusion of prosperity,” he wrote. “Eventually, reality catches up to the Federal Reserve-created fantasies. When that happens, there is a recession or worse, leading the Fed to start the whole boom-and-bust cycle over again.”
