personalfinance,Ally Bank - No-penalty CD @ 2.05% vs. Savings Account @ 1.9%,"Hi all,

Ally dropped their savings account interest rate down to 1.9% (from 2.2%) over the last few months as the Fed adjusted their rates. Ally offers a No-penalty CD with a 2.05% interest rate for balances over $25,000. I have more than that parked in a savings account with Ally.

Any reason why I shouldn't shift that money into the No-penalty CD? Is there a catch or some fine print I'm missing somewhere?

Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on investing and savings,"Hi! I'd love any advice I can get about investing and creating a good savings for future.

I am mid 20s with a stable full time job. I currently have a Merrill Edge traditional IRA with about 10k. I don't know much about stocks so I haven't put any more money in it in the last 2 years. I really want an IRA that auto-invests for me so am thinking about transferring it all to a Wealthfront IRA. 

I also have a 401k with Securian from my last job that I'm thinking about rolling over to a Vanguard IRA.

I also have about 15k in my savings account but the interest rate is obviously really low. So my questions are: are Wealthfront and Vanguard good options or are there other companies that will auto-invest for me? And should I put the other 15k into either IRA or put that into a High yield savings account or a CD instead.

I just want to invest and save smart and am not sure the best way to go about to ensure the biggest return in the future.

thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Need help salvaging a roth cd,"So tax time I decided to open a roth ira. I had been behind on making contributions towards a retirement and I don't get employer matching so the roth ira was the best bet. I bring my documents and explain to the 'personal banker' I specifically want a roth ira and not a traditional ira. She says ok and tells me the interest rate. She then shows me this flyer and explains I can choose how long I don't want to initially access the account. The longer I hold on up first access the higher the interest rate. I don't need the money so I choose the maximum which is 5 years for 2.5% interest. 

This summer I decided to contribute to the roth before the next quarter to benefit from a higher interest return. I had been having problems with bankers trying to take the contribution from my savings so I went back to the opening branch. The new banker then checked and told me that the account that was opened was a roth cd which is fixed. She said she could try to convert it to a liquid money market account but I was fuming and left.

My questions are: 
How can I salvage the money and lost interest? How do I open the actual roth ira account I wanted? This second teller said I could have two roth accounts (one roth &amp; one roth mm) which sounds unbelievable.
 
Can/should I raise a concern regarding the initial banker's conduct? Sure it can be argued that I ultimately signed the dotted line but as a representative of the bank, if she says something I take her authority on it. When I sat down and said roth ira, I believed that is what she was assisting me with.",finance

personalfinance,Does this budget look ok?,"I’m trying to figure out our new budget with our new child starting day care soon. I’ll call it monthly, but our biggest costs are budgeted every 4 weeks (mortgage/day care).

The wife and I both contribute ~10% to pre-tax 401k. We live in a roughly middle COL area.

**Monthly Income:**

$8732 (take home pay)

**Monthly Bills ($5702):**

$1818 – Day care

$1472 – Mortgage

$850 – Car payments (this will cut in half in about 1 year when one car is paid off)

$500 – Food (this is an estimate on groceries. I recently opened a joint credit card to track this better)

$400 – Student loan payment

&lt; $300 – Electricity/Water/Gas

$70 – Internet 

$200 – Phone 

$57 – ADT security

$35 – Hulu/Netflix/Amazon Prime

**Monthly Savings ($1788):**

$200 – Emergency fund (slightly underfunded currently)

$200 – Baby fund (used for various child related expenses)

$288 – House repair/ Car repair + lawn/pest control (this is almost empty and probably needs an increase)

$1100 – 2xRoth IRA max + car insurance

**Remainder ($1242)** – slush fund? beer money/ occasional restaurants. It’s possible we’re spending more on food than I realize. Plan to figure that out ASAP. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That’s all I can think of at the moment but can answer any questions.

Any advice? Anything that sticks out? I know the car payment is high, but that won’t be for much longer. We splurged a bit on safer, roomier cars when we had kids. Our last cars were 15+ years old and barely running when we upgraded. We will also run these into the ground. We work in aerospace, which is prone to lay offs, but lay offs generally come with severance. My job is secure since I work for the federal government, so the only concern is for my wife’s job.

**Edit for more info:**

I have $40k in TSP, $18k in Roth IRA, and I have a pension.

personalfinance,Keep paying on the debt or file bankruptcy?,"My best friend told me to post this here. 4 years ago while I was in college, I learned about life the hard way. I got into major debt. The year I went to college, student loans weren't available. Not enough credit to get another loan elsewhere. So, I got tons of credit cards to pay for college. Big mistake. I'm 25 and I learned a lot in the last 7 years. I'm much better now than I use to be. However, I went from a 400 credit score to roughly 630 now. I'm getting there. 

I have way less debt than I use to too. So, I still have a lot. Just 3 months ago, I had about 18,000 worth of debt with 15 credit cards and loans. Now, I have $15,300 on 10 credit cards and loans. I pay about $1,000 a month towards my debt. However, interest rate is extremely high on a $3,000 loan. Last year my job shutdown for 2 months, my car got totalled. It was a bad show. So, this December my job will give up two bonuses. I plan to use those to pay off the $3,000 loan. I pay $150 a month but it hasn't even made a dent a year later. 

However, $1,000 a month that im paying towards the debt is making a difference, but not quickly. My living situation isn't the best. I have a step family member who reminds me of the debt all of the time. It's causing my depression to go up. I'm doing my best. However, my parents keep telling me to look into bankruptcy. I have a 2016 Honda Civic. I went from a lemon car that always cost me tons of money, and slowly worked my way up to this car. 
I rather not file bankruptcy. I don't want to chance losing the car. I'm so close to getting the debt paid down giving it another year seems logical to me. 
I just don't know the wisest choice. I learned a lot. I'm just ready to have things paid off so I can have my own place again. I still can't find any consolation loans as my credit score isn't high enough just yet. I've tried to lower my interests on some accounts but companies don't want to lower it usually. 

Any advice is welcome. Thanks so much and I hope you have a great week! Just wanted to at least see other people's opinion on the smartest way to attack the debt and not have to live with family.

finance,RBA Cuts Interest Rates Again,,finance
Forex,RBA statement. Rate cut by 25 pts. 1st October 2019,"At its meeting today, the Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.75 per cent.

While the outlook for the global economy remains reasonable, the risks are tilted to the downside. The US–China trade and technology disputes are affecting international trade flows and investment as businesses scale back spending plans because of the increased uncertainty. At the same time, in most advanced economies, unemployment rates are low and wages growth has picked up, although inflation remains low. In China, the authorities have taken further steps to support the economy, while continuing to address risks in the financial system.

Interest rates are very low around the world and further monetary easing is widely expected, as central banks respond to the persistent downside risks to the global economy and subdued inflation. Long-term government bond yields are around record lows in many countries, including Australia. Borrowing rates for both businesses and households are also at historically low levels. The Australian dollar is at its lowest level of recent times.

The Australian economy expanded by 1.4 per cent over the year to the June quarter, which was a weaker-than-expected outcome. A gentle turning point, however, appears to have been reached with economic growth a little higher over the first half of this year than over the second half of 2018. The low level of interest rates, recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, signs of stabilisation in some established housing markets and a brighter outlook for the resources sector should all support growth. The main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for consumption, with the sustained period of only modest increases in household disposable income continuing to weigh on consumer spending.

Employment has continued to grow strongly and labour force participation is at a record high. The unemployment rate has, however, remained steady at around 5¼ per cent over recent months. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand indicate that employment growth is likely to slow from its recent fast rate. Wages growth remains subdued and there is little upward pressure at present, with increased labour demand being met by more supply. Caps on wages growth are also affecting public-sector pay outcomes across the country. A further gradual lift in wages growth would be a welcome development. Taken together, recent outcomes suggest that the Australian economy can sustain lower rates of unemployment and underemployment.

Inflation pressures remain subdued and this is likely to be the case for some time yet. In both headline and underlying terms, inflation is expected to be a little under 2 per cent over 2020 and a little above 2 per cent over 2021.

There are further signs of a turnaround in established housing markets, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. In contrast, new dwelling activity has weakened and growth in housing credit remains low. Demand for credit by investors is subdued and credit conditions, especially for small and medium-sized businesses, remain tight. Mortgage rates are at record lows and there is strong competition for borrowers of high credit quality.

The Board took the decision to lower interest rates further today to support employment and income growth and to provide greater confidence that inflation will be consistent with the medium-term target. The economy still has spare capacity and lower interest rates will help make inroads into that. The Board also took account of the forces leading to the trend to lower interest rates globally and the effects this trend is having on the Australian economy and inflation outcomes.

It is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target. The Board will continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and the achievement of the inflation target over time.",finance

personalfinance,"OASDI and Medicare were only taken out for a short time, wondering why?","Hi!

Long time lurker, second-time poster.

I work part-time at my state university in Texas, about 25 hours a week, at not such a bad wage when it comes to on-campus employment.

Since I started about a year ago, I noticed that nothing else but the payroll tax was withheld from my check: $184 from September to December '18. I assumed I hadn't made enough to be taxed for anything else, and sort of went on my way and claimed the $184 as a refund in January '19.

For most of 2019, nothing else was withheld until this past June, when I crossed the $7k threshold and both OASDI and Medicare were withheld. They took a healthy chunk of each check until mid-August, when I crossed $10k and both OASDI and Medicare stopped being withheld.

Now on the second check since then, only Federal taxes have been withheld on these two, and I'll probably pass the $12k mark at the beginning of November.

So I'm wondering: why were OASDI and Medicare only taken out for a short two months, and will they be taken out again in the future? Is being a state employee (according to my boss and his boss) somehow related to this? And if they weren't supposed to be withheld, will I get them back as a refund?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

devops,"Started a new job, don't think it's for me. Advice?","So I've been working in 'devops' for a couple of years at one company, working with the usual things (Node.js microservices, aws, ecs, ansible, terraform, salt, docker, jenkins, bash, python etc). I got fed up of the toxic environment and left for a new job about 2 weeks ago. 

So my issue so far is that they aren't using any of the tech we spoke about in the interviews. Everything is Java oriented and monolithic. I asked about things like docker, kubernetes and was told that the client doesn't want to touch docker. Fair enough. My biggest issues are that my 2 closest colleagues are from a pure Java dev background and they don't know much about ops (they are afraid of it) and don't seem to know AWS at all. So all the tasks seem to be very centered around scm management and creating Jenkins scripts. 

So during my first week, I was given the task of automating a job in jenkins to email devs with stale/abandoned branches. I write this in Python, since it's what I'm most familiar with. Then I'm told, ""no, no, we don't use Python here. You have to do everything in Groovy"". Fuck that, I thought. I asked why, and they reply ""It just works better in Jenkins and is more consistent with our other scripts, and this one guy doesn't like Python"". Fair enough, but I have no ambitions to become a Groovy expert and did mention that Python was my language of choice during the interviews.

So at this point, I'm pretty downbeat and 95% sure I don't want to stay here. I am expecting another job offer this week, however they focus mainly on Openstack. But I am enticed by the other tech they are working with, and it seems to be much heavier on the ops side. But, as with this place, I'm concerned about not using AWS or other cloud providers as I don't want to become rusty. 

So, should I jump to the other role and wipe this place from my CV? Or hold out for something better and deal with the awkward questions of why I don't want to stay after only being here a few weeks?",technology

My credit score is right around 670, and I would love advice on how to pay it down. I have a steady job making \~$70k a year. Here are two options I'm considering:

1. Apply for a personal loan for the full amount and pay that off in 36 months.
2. Apply for a personal loan for half the amount and put the other half on a 0% APR card.

I have experience paying off a personal loan, so that option strikes me as easier as long as I get a lower interest rate than what I'm currently paying. However, I am worried about getting approved for the loan with my credit score. Also I worry that if I don't get approved for the loan or a balance transfer card, that my credit score will fall and it'll be harder to find a way to pay these balances down \[though worst case scenario if that happens, I just increase the amount I'm paying currently on both balances, I suppose\].

Also I've gotten a loan from Upstart before and the experience was fine, does anyone have any suggestions for other places to look for good rates? And in terms of Balance Transfer cards, I was looking at the Chase Slate or the Citi Double Cash, but if anyone has suggestions, please let me know.

I am still a U.S. citizen and have been mindful of my tax obligations since before I left. I plan to hire a CPA to help me file my 2019 taxes but want some information now to prepare. 

I understand that the tax credit (or whatever it is) requires the person live outside the USA for no less than 330 days out of a consecutive 365 days. I already spent about 15 days in the USA since moving here due to a business trip, so I am rationing out my next visit carefully. 

However, since I moved abroad in the middle of the year, I don’t know how that will impact me. 

will I need to be in the U.S. to submit my taxes? Will I have to meet with the CPA personally to sign papers or anything?

I found an article on this but it’s a bit old. If I underhand correctly, I can get an extension for filing to meet the requirements for the physical presence test? Is that accurate?

personalfinance,Help with Corrected W2 for overpayment.,"Hey you all, i'm hoping you can help me figure out what to do.

I was overpaid by my employer by about $4k last year. I paid it back this year and had to get a corrected W2. I don't think they did this correctly and they're saying they did it correctly but i'm having to speak through the hr service center and unfortunately, they're not accountants and can't explain to me.

The issue is that I paid back $4k but on the corrected w2, box 1 is not changed. Should this not be Original Amount - $4K

The second issue is that they entered a lower number for boxes 4,5 and 6. (social security tax, medicare wages and medicare tax). I agree that medicare wages should be lowered but given that i've already paid the taxes to the federal government, i don't see how boxes 4 and 6 can be lowered).

The response given to me was that they can't adjust box 1 because it's already reported to the IRS. Also, they're apparently calculating taxes due in boxes 4 and 6 (although those boxes asy ""taxes withheld"").

Also, none of the boxes on the ""state"" side were changed. Shouldn't this match the information ont he federal side?

I'm quite lost and don't know how to approach the situation.

PS: i still haven't filed for taxes for last year and need to get this done in the next 2 weeks.

personalfinance,"Recently paid off unknown medical debt in collections, where to go from here?","Background:

I'm a 21 year old recent college graduate (staring down the back half of my student loan grace period) who started my first full time gig in August. Just before I moved out of my college housing in July, I noticed that my credit score had dropped from ~630 to 595 since April. Unsure of what happened, I got my report and noticed a serious delinquency from a medical bill that was placed for collections in December of 2018. The bill was from a surgeon's office, who performed my appendectomy in September of 2017, and due to a miscommunication of some kind, was never sent to my health insurance provider. Between my surgery in 2017 and my credit check in July, I had no knowledge of this bill and had received no notice, via mail or phone, of it, or the delinquency. Once I realized what was going on, I did some digging and discovered that the bill was sent to an incorrect address (off 1 digit from my actual home address). So from there, with the help of my parents, I got in contact with the collections agency and paid off the bill. 

*Now, in hindsight, I realize that I would have likely been better off researching my options about how to handle the situation, especially considering that I wasn't aware of the debt at all until after it was placed in collections. 

So now that leaves me here, currently living with friends (away from home where my current job and career prospects are) for a mercifully cheap rent, and relatively financially stable, but unable to apply for any rentals because of my credit score, and also slightly terrified that I'll be living with the burden of this issue for the next ~5 years (according to my report). My credit wasn't excellent to begin with, as I only had a single credit card from a credit union that I relied on fairly heavily for a time, but never missed payments on, and paid off in full as regularly as I could, but now with my current vehicle in its twilight years, I'm also concerned that I won't be able to get a new(used) car without paying extortionate interest rates while also having to pay back student loans. 

So now my question is: what's next? How do I move on from this in a constructive way, and what are my options for repairing my credit so that I can move out of my temporary living situation sooner than 5 years from now, and also get on with my life financially? 

I have looked into the possibility of a goodwill deletion, which I understand is a long shot, especially from a collections agency, but they are locally based, and this is the only real issue I've ever had with my credit since I started having credit ~5 years ago. So I'm certainly willing to try, but I'm hoping to find some guidance in that process and also any thoughts and advice on how to move forward and leave this behind as soon as possible.

NOTE: this collections account only shows up on my TransUnion report, and not my Equifax. I was unable to get an online copy of my Experian report, so I am unsure if it's present there.",finance

* After cleaning out all credit card debts/relocation/settled down currently I have \~23,000 left in my bank account with the first half of signing bonus paid. Want to keep $5000 in checking account incase of emergency and gift for parent.
* I don't own car and I really like taking transit(reading books).
* I don't have any dependent, I am completely alone :(
* After tax, health benefit (HSA), and maxing out 401k I end up with $5000 per month.  

   * Fixed payment $1500 rent + utilities

personalfinance,Is it better to pay off all my wife's student loans now or should I pay it off after a year for tax benefits?,"Just recently got married and my wife has some student loans (~22k) and just recently graduated (We live in the US). We don't have to pay right now but do have to soon as the grace period is almost over. 
Luckily, I have a decent job where I have the savings to actually pay it all off now (~140k/yr). While I do know the general rule of thumb is to pay off your loans as soon as possible, I want to know if there was any tax advantage to just follow a payment plan to pay it all off in a year or not. Would I get any tax exemptions for getting married (getting a dependent) and paying off my wife's loans?

If the tax exemptions are not worth it, should I just pay it all off now so we don't have to pay for any interest?

There are 3 separate loans but the total of all are around 22k, and the avg interest rate is ~4.5% (3.7% 4.6% and 5.5%),

Would be interested to know people's thoughts.

personalfinance,"Navient Autopay Changes, Same Aggregate Payment, New (Worse) Principal Distribution","I just noticed a change on my September autopay for Navient. The total amount paid is unchanged, but they snuck in a new allocation of principal. For a loan I prepaid some on, the principle allocation is now lower than the full monthly amount and other loans have a higher principal payment. 


I'd say plenty of people pre-paid their highest interest rate loans to save, but this new payment allocation makes autopay principals effectively weighted toward the lower interest loans. Now all of the loans will be paid off on the same date, maximizing interest paid on the high interest loan through autopay.


Anyone else seeing this new formula on their Navient accounts?",finance
personalfinance,Seeking advice regarding personal loans for debt consolidation,"I'll start by saying that I know that the general consensus is that getting a loan to consolidate debt is typically a bad idea, as it only treats the symptom, not the actual issue. I also know that many people fall prey to their poor spending habits after doing something like this, and end up with even MORE debt. 

That's not what I'm here to discuss. I'm looking for advice about personal loans. My wife and I basically have our credit usage under control (cards are detached from everything &amp; frozen in a literal block of ice in the freezer) but our net income is basically $50 after all bills/expenses, so we're never going to beat the interest rates at this point. Aside from one of us getting a better paying job, we're stick treading water until we can dump our tax returns on the higher interest/payment cards to create enough breathing room to be aggressive with the remaining debt.  

Given how tight things are, having everything consolidated into one payment would reduce the likelihood of us having to use an emergency credit card in the event Murphy's law goes into effect, and we'd carry treading water until tax season, as planned. The possibility of going further into debt to survive things going wrong, like if my wife were to lose her job, is very real. Then our tax return wouldn't go as far on our debt, and it's just be bad overall.

 We've been getting mail from lenders offering personal loans for this exact purpose and my wife asked me to do some digging. I know all the aforementioned pitfalls of getting a loan when you're already in debt. Is there anything else I should know if I am to go through with this? Are there certain lenders, banks, etc. that are recommended for this kind of thing? I'm not thrilled with this idea but as it stands we're basically on the edge of a cliff and just hoping nothing knocks us off until the beginning of March, and this seems like it would be a way for us get away from the edge, if we keep playing it smart.

personalfinance,Balance transfer from Bank A -&gt; Bank B -&gt; Bank A? Is this possible?,"Hi all! 

I need a bit of advice.

I'm working through paying some long standing debt, about $3000. My current card at Bank A has me at a 17% interest rate, and since it looks like Ill be able to pay off the full balance easily in the next 10 months I'm looking into doing a balance transfer of this debt onto a new card that offers $0 balance transfer fees and 0% APR for the first 13 months. My credit score is alright (about 720), so I think Ill qualify. 

The only problem is this new card that I want is... at my current bank. 

Thats when I realized! I have a card at *another* bank (Bank B) so, why not just do that? 

If I pay $90 I can transfer my debt from Bank A to Bank B. Then, if I get the card, I can do a balance transfer with no additional fees from Bank B back to Bank A onto the new card. 

Im wondering-- is this possible? 

Im looking through the paperwork and  I cant find anything expressly *against* it, but I worry Ill run into snags like that new balance transfers cannot be transfered before 6 months or something like that. This certainly seems like far too easy of a loophole to have found. And theres quite a bit on the line-- if the second balance transfer back to Bank A fails, Ill be stuck with all of my debt being charged at a 22% interest rate! So I really cant let it get stuck.

personalfinance,"A 401(k) withdrawal question, but with high salaries (~98th%ile household income)","So, my wife and I are thinking about cashing in her 401(k).  First, our financial background:

We are both in our mid-30s, she makes about $200,000 and I make about $250,000.  I expect to move to the next tier in my career within the next year, and move my all-in compensation to around $400,000; I understand that this is not certain, of course.  In case it's relevant, we live in NYC, which also means we pay quite a bit in income taxes (federal, state, and city).

We weren't always earning this much (in fact, us crossing past the $300,000 threshold all-in is very new), but we've both been maxing out our 401(k) accounts for the last few years.  She currently has over $200,000 in hers, and I have $70,000; both are fully vested.  Additionally, we have a 6-month cushion in savings (we are late to the savings game), and I have a nominal amount ($15,000) in a brokerage account.

For liabilities, we have a moderate to high amount of credit card debt (around $20,000; we had been aggressively paying this down) and I have a high amount of student loans outstanding (around $80,000).  Additionally, we provide a nominal amount of support to both our parents (a total of around $1,000/month); we expect this to increase in the future as both our parents are in their 70s.

My wife proposed the idea of cashing out her 401(k) and taking the penalty (I believe calculators have us at just around $100,000 take-home if we do, or about 50% of the value of her 401(k)), and use that as a down payment on an apartment here in NYC.

Her arguments for doing so:

1. We could immediately begin building equity.
2. The loss in 401(k) value is taxes we would have paid anyway (which is a lot) + the 10% penalty (which is not much all things considered)
3. Given our high salaries, and the fact that we haven't really started saving until our 30s, the loss is not insurmountable
4. We are young and both expect to work until we are 70

My arguments against doing so:

1. Compound interest and 401(k) contribution caps make pre-tax saving extremely difficult.
2. We're wiping out a tremendous amount of pre-tax value, especially considering our future income will almost certainly be lower
3. We'll have to save aggressively with post-tax dollars
4. I might not move to the next tier of my career next year or ever

Context: 

* 32f, 2 years post-graduate school (8 years - woof). Renting in HCOL city ($2300/month total, split 70/30 with my spouse based on income disparity). Stable professional career. May want to move toward becoming a homeowner in the next 3-5 years (not a buyer's market in our city right now), but that's not a necessity. No plans for children at this time.
* Student loan debt: $124K (was $168K 2 years ago, and I have paid them down to $124K over the last two years); 4.8% interest rate after refinancing from federal loan (6.8% interest) to private loan company 2 years ago, 8 years remaining on loan term
   * I currently pay at least $2K/month to my loan (minimum payment $1700/month), some months I can put in $100-400 extra to the loan payment on top of the $2K. At this pace, the loans should be paid by 2025 (though I'd love to be done sooner)
* Current salary: $145K/year, take home pay is about $3600 every two weeks
* Current savings: $35K (would get me about 6 months living expenses in case of emergency), using online bank with 1.9% interest
   * Current savings rate of $1-2K/month over the last two years (started at zero savings 2 years ago)
* Other debt: Car loan $11.5K with 2.95% interest rate, 3 years remaining on loan term, currently making minimum monthly payments of $327 due to low interest rate; no credit card debt
* Retirement: started 2 years ago, 401k and contributing enough to get full employer match (account opened 2 years ago, now at $15K)
* Spouse: annual salary $42K, no debt, minimal retirement funds so far (working on it)

My goals: pay down my loan debt ASAP, without overlooking responsible savings/retirement investments.

My questions:

* Should I stop putting money into savings, since I have enough to live on for 6 months if necessary?
* Should that extra $1-2K that I don't put into savings get put toward my loan to pay it down as fast as possible? Or should it go into retirement or other investment?
* Many people tell me student loan debt is ""good"" debt and I should focus on saving for a house more than cracking down on loans. But the debt would be crushing if suddenly something happened to my career, so I can't bear to let it stew for 20 years - this is why my focus is on loan payments first. Am I going about this the wrong way?
* Is there anything else glaring with the above that I could do differently? Rent is the first thing I would try to lower, but is really not realistic in our city unless we want to commute 2 hours to work each way.

It is now time to dive deep into this topic and discuss the most critical factors that define DevOps culture-wise. I’m also going to point out some of the pitfalls that you need to be aware of when trying to implement DevOps culture in your organization. Cultural transformation is no joke, as it requires people to change the way they think and act.

## Towards the same goal – we’re all in this together

Working together to provide business value to your customers is the single most important goal every business should be obsessed about. It is also the cornerstone of DevOps culture. Back in the old days, developers strived to maximize feature releases, while operations people were all about system’s stability. These opposing incentives created unnecessary tensions and had an impact on software quality. Instead of this false dichotomy, DevOps culture cares about [how real users experience your software](https://www.zdnet.com/article/user-experience-now-top-of-mind-even-before-software-is-conceived/). Developers, QA, operations people should all be in line with this, and every incentive in your organization has to serve this cause. The role of top executives cannot be overstated in [managing organizational change](https://hbr.org/2018/10/dont-just-tell-employees-organizational-changes-are-coming-explain-why). People need to have a strong cause to start behaving differently, so it's essential to continuously communicate it though all available channels.

DevOps culture promotes collaboration above all else. Of course, this is easier said than done. You cannot use a top-down approach to force people into cooperation. A better idea would be to find colleagues who believe in DevOps and work with them to spread the culture within their teams. It is also worth to set-up a robust communication channel between your teams to facilitate collaboration. There’s nothing as near and dear to engineer’s heart as live chat so I would stick with that. Don’t forget live meetings as well. DevOps is very dynamic, and face-to-face discussions help everyone stay on the bleeding edge. Try having them at least once a week.

Top challenges:

* *No approval from top executives.* It’s a strategic decision to implement DevOps culture, which won’t last unless you ensure you are in-line with upper management in your organization.
* *No buy-in from people involved.* DevOps culture should be instigated from the bottom up just as much as from the top down. Make sure you have DevOps evangelists in different teams to facilitate the adoption.
* *The false dichotomy of incentives.* You shouldn’t have competing goals for different teams since that creates misalignment and artificial friction between teams. Instead, motivate your teams by how well they contribute to making the customer’s life better.

## Bridge all silos – sharing is caring

DevOps culture bridges all silos between your IT teams from idea inception to full production scale. To do so, organizations make software creation as transparent as possible. Everybody is invited to the party and has full visibility into every stage of the process. Software planning, building, testing, deployment, and improvement require everyone’s participation. Having diverse skill-sets around the table at each stage helps businesses avoid [technical debt](https://hackernoon.com/there-are-3-main-types-of-technical-debt-heres-how-to-manage-them-4a3328a4c50c) and boost employee engagement. You know what everyone’s working on and how high is the priority of their current task. It sets your mind to providing real business value to your customers, rather than merely manufacturing software features.

DevOps teams focus on competencies instead of roles. Roles are rigid and clunky, while competencies are fluid and adaptive. It is the reason why high-performing DevOps teams have a robust knowledge-sharing culture and include well-rounded IT professionals. Dev and Ops should have face-to-face interactions to learn new skills. You may use job shadowing, pair programming, or developer rotation for that. Don’t forget to have constant scrum meetings and project retrospectives to foster collective discussions.

Knowledge-sharing improves when your teams start using common DevOps tools. At a minimum, there should be access to code, logs, and postmortem reports for everyone in IT. This way, your team members can think holistically about software development and incorporate cross-functional wisdom into their everyday work.

Top challenges:

* *Fear to lose power and authority.* There may be some “superstars “in your company who treat knowledge-sharing as a threat to their position. Try to help them understand the limitations of such perspective and the benefits of DevOps culture.
* *Fear of public speaking.* Many engineers are introverts and are not that fond of public speaking. Try to reduce this fear by creating small teams, where everyone feels comfortable and knows each other well.
* *Excessive bureaucracy.* Don’t get too formal in your collaboration. You need to find the golden middle between chaos and structure in DevOps.

## Autonomous teams – with great freedom comes great responsibility

Small, multi-disciplinary, loosely-coupled, [product-centric teams](https://www.devopsgroup.com/blog/devops-and-the-product-centric-approach/) are what makes DevOps culture so effective. An ideal DevOps team should be small enough to be fed with two pizzas. It would consist of developers, operations engineers, QA specialists, and project managers, all tightly aligned with the same goal. The work is done in small batches to improve end-to-end delivery of customer value. Any friction is eliminated along the way. Individuals are empowered to make everyday decisions that speeds up their work even more. When your teams have diverse skill-sets and all the data they need, people form well-rounded opinions, and it gets harder to go off-course.

Autonomy is freedom that requires a strong sense of responsibility. On the team level, DevOps culture holds everyone mutually accountable for how users experience your software. As Nicole Forsgren put it in her book [Accelerate](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339), DevOps teams should be evaluated by four KPIs:

1. Lead time for changes – the time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production;
2. Deployment frequency – software deployment to production or an app store;
3. Time to restore service – mean time to recovery (MTTR) your services;
4. Change failure rate – how often deployment failures occur in production that requires an immediate rollback.

Nevertheless, individually, you are still responsible for the piece of code you have released. The rule of thumb is “if you built it, you run it“. If your build fails, you have to fix your code as soon as possible to avoid jamming the whole CI/CD pipeline.

Top challenges:

* The structure over the community. Often people get too much focused on processes and workflows, rather than building a community of collaboration. If you do the culture right, everything else follows.
* The word game. You cannot merely name someone DevOps and hope they would somehow change. Instead, you should group people with different skillsets and assign them a common goal.
* Lack of trust. Managers are sometimes tempted to micromanage the hell out of people. Just trust your teams to do the good work and let them share their progress.

## Failing quickly – a scientific approach to better software

DevOps movement raises a simple question. How can you build better quality software quicker? A software system may be thought of as an ever-changing organism. Especially today, if you are building a modern cloud-native application, there’s a horde of loosely coupled parts interacting with each other. So how would DevOps help you deal with this challenge?

Automation is an ultimate prerequisite for building up DevOps culture. Your tests, builds, deployment, environment configuration, monitoring, and even documentation can benefit from automation and the right DevOps tools. In addition to saving your time and reducing failure rate for tedious tasks, automation also lets you fail quickly. Such a mentality is essential in DevOps culture since it liberates your team to experiment more and test ideas at a much faster pace.

DevOps helps you integrate the scientific method into your workflow, allowing IT engineers to leverage the very same mindset that made sciences flourish throughout the last few centuries. First, you observe. In business, it means you are monitoring how your customers use your software (quantitative observation) and making proactive efforts to assess their opinions (qualitative observation). Next, you can make a calculated hypothesis that is based on your observations. For instance, we believe that DevOps team leaders (customer segment) want to quickly see their team members’ activity on a cloud platform (product/feature/service) because it helps them maintain accountability when promoting DevOps culture in their organizations (value proposition). Your hypothesis needs to be verifiable and have a measurable conclusion, like “we expect 30% of our user base to try this feature in the first month with a 60% adoption rate after the first 3 months have passed. Then you do your programming magic. The aim is to test your idea in production as quick and as cheap as possible, so you develop in bite-sized chunks and make frequent releases. If your code build fails, fixing it becomes your primary objective. And if your feature fails, you should remove it from your solution whatsoever. Remember, DevOps is all about continuous value delivery – you don’t want to carry waste that is a downer to your customers.

Top challenges:

* Over-automating things. If your process is flawed, automation only helps you make your faulty process happen faster. You should first cherry-pick the processes that work for you, taking into consideration what’s unique in your business.
* HiPPO (highest paid person’s opinion) effect – when there is a lack of data, and a decision needs to be made, the group often defers to the judgment of the HiPPO. People are prone to [authority bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_bias), which can lead your organization astray. Start with intuitions, experiment, and make data-driven decisions instead.
* Working around the failure – don’t delay failures or try to fail silently. If you fail, you fail – that’s your moment of truth. It helps you improve in the long run.

## Experimentation-friendly environment – fail fast, learn faster

After you’ve created a robust hypothesis-driven development culture and the feedback is pouring-in, it is the time to make sense of your data. After each experiment, you want to assess what you have learned. You may want to adjust your software feature, hypothesis, or your key assumptions. DevOps culture celebrates failure as an opportunity to improve. If you make mistakes faster than everyone else, you also innovate more quickly. This is how DevOps culture adds up to the competitive advantage of your business.

For this process to work well, you need to build a blame-free culture in your organization. People are often prone to scapegoating, so you need to start rewarding failure as a way of learning. For instance, you may create a visual board for the most significant failures that are also your biggest lessons. It’s also a good idea to have retrospective reviews every few weeks, where teams could share their newest insights and learn from each other. In doing so, you have to be blame-aware and do not allow pointing fingers at each other. Remember that everyone in your organization is in the same boat and share the same good intentions towards your business success.

Having a no-blame culture removes friction, but it is not sufficient for the DevOps culture to fully flourish. To experiment a lot, you need a stream of creative ideas. The most impactful thing here is to employ the [collective intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence) of all your team members. Everybody should be allowed to put their ideas on the table since no single person is smart enough to drive a company alone. The more ideas we have, the better our experiments become. To build that creative muscle companies can also dedicate some slack time once a month when team members are be paid to learn and build anything they like. If that’s not enough, you can organize a company-wide event like a workshop or hackathon to create a lasting experience of creative joy for your colleagues. All in all, creativity is a muscle that requires a positive environment and needs to be exercised continuously to bear fruit.

Top challenges:

* The blame game. Even though you may have autonomy and get praised for your wins, people may still be inclined to blame you for your mistakes. Acknowledge your failures and present your colleagues what you have learned from them.
* Fear of failure. You are going to fail a lot, but that’s part of the game. It is necessary to change the mindset from creating perfect software to continuously providing new valuable features. Reward the most critical lessons learned in your organization.
* Velocity above feature impact. Your team may get easily tempted to coin new sexy features without measuring feature impact. Avoid this, since it makes you product-centric, and leads to losing sight of your customers.

## On a final note

DevOps is often considered primarily as a culture, not without reason. Collaboration, transparency, knowledge-sharing, experimenting, and working towards a single goal requires the right attitude from everyone in your organization. If you get it right, everything else follows, because, by the end of a day, good culture fixes broken processes.

dogecoin,Blockchain Is The Next Big Thing For Renewable Energy.,"Blockchain has been touted as the next big technological advance - impacting everything from online transactions to e-government. But what does it mean for renewable energy? Essentially an online register that securely stores information, blockchain serves as a repertoire of knowledge accessible to everyone. Rather than being controlled by one entity, blockchain is spread across multiple computers and uses a form of data logging to ensure that the information cannot be changed or corrupted by anyone else. By decentralizing data and protecting the way it is manipulated, blockchain promotes transparency and the sharing of information. 

Energy systems are undergoing rapid changes to accommodate the increasing volumes of embedded renewable generation, such as wind and solar PV. Renewable energy sources (RES) have undergone massive development in recent years, enabled by privatisation, unbundling of the energy sector and boosted by financial incentives and energy policy initiatives. In 2016, 24.6% of the UK gross electricity consumption was generated by RES, mainly from onshore and offshore wind farms and PV solar plants, accounting for 44.9% and 12.5% of the total 35.7 GW installed RES capacity.

We just need a very little effort to recycle rejected or used tires, but how on earth, whopping 280m of them get thrown away in the US alone? According to the Federal Highway Administration Research and Technology (FDHART) There is just Less than 7% of these tires are being recycled, while the 11% becoming fuel and about 5% of them are being exported out of the country.

gaming,"In video games, would you identify with an entire faction the same way you would a singular main protagonist?","You know?  Like identifying with Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher trilogy, as opposed to, say, the Northern Kingdoms, Nilfgaard, the Scoia'tael, Skellige, Novigrad's Syndicate, the very monsters Geralt would hunt and kill for profit, and their wide and diverse range of different characters that would eventually make up Gwent?  Or Commander Shepard from the Mass Effect trilogy going from commanding a ship and squad, to commanding an entire multi-racial fleet at the end of Mass Effect 3.

I'm asking this because whenever I look at, say, adventuring parties in RPGs like Pokemon and Final Fantasy, or five-man band combining super robots like Combattler V, Voltes V, and the Super Sentai mecha, I can't help but think about entire factions, like in Chainmail -- the predecessor to and inspiration for Dungeons &amp; Dragons -- and Mobile Suit Gundam with warring factions like the Earth Federation and Principality of Zeon.  I mean, factions share much of the same group dynamics as a five-man band or any other small group like it.  You have a civilian support staff providing extra men and resources to the frontline soldiers at the home front; the frontline soldiers themselves defending the home front while invading the enemy's home front; and a commanding officer centralizing both frontline soldiers and civilian staff and making life-or-death decisions for them as a collective.  Likewise, the leader is self-explanatory, but the lancer would have served as the second-in-command, while the big guy would have served as a potential frontline soldier himself, and the smart guy and chick/heart would have served a support role like the home front civilian staff.

And it's because of that, that a faction would have acted as much like a surrogate family fighting a common enemy together as a five-man band or other smaller ensemble cast of characters.  Right?",technology

personalfinance,Confirm My Understanding Of Using HSA To Pay For Employer Sponsored Healthcare Premiums After 65,"Everything I have read suggests that once I turn 65, I can use my HSA to pay for my portion of my health insurance premium for employer sponsored health care.

What I have found on the IRS website isn't that explicit but also appears to be supportive:

Insurance premiums. You can’t treat insurance premiums as qualified medical expenses unless the premiums are for:

* Long-term care insurance.
* Health care continuation coverage (such as coverage under COBRA).
* Health care coverage while receiving unemployment compensation under federal or state law.
* Medicare and other health care coverage if you were 65 or older (other than premiums for a Medicare supplemental policy, such as Medigap).

Assuming my understanding up until this point is good, let's go a little deeper into the situation

* Assume my portion of my premium comes out pre-tax (no federal, state, medicare or SS imposed)
* Assume my employer sponsored health insurance is an HDHP
* Assume that a portion of the premium is passed through to the HSA

Am I able to deduct the full amount of the employee portion of the premium given that some of the premium is passed through to the HSA?

I suspect the answer is 100% yes because in the HSA, the contribution is labeled as employer contribution but I figure the hivemind of Reddit would know better than myself.

On top of this, I believed if I could still afford my monthly minimum payments, I was fine. This short sightedness has ruined what would otherwise have been a great opportunity to save money for several years as I still live with my parents.

My current monthly expenses - $100 gas

Thats it.

Current credit card situation

7. B- $7384.01, MD- $242

8. B- $2107.27, MD- $61

Total Balance- $22,717.33

Total Minimum per Month- $742.60

Average pay check, 75hrs @ 12.50 = $750 after taxes. $1500 a month.

Checking account balance- $900

Savings account - $0

Student loan repayment begins at the end of the year. Projected payment is currently $190, which is the lowest payment possible and results in the most interest.

&amp;#x200B;

I consider myself to be financially ignorant but have begun research on how to further tackle the issue. What am I currently doing to resolve the situation?

\-I no longer carry any of my credit cards with me

\-all credit card info has been removed from various sites I would actively spend money, as well as all recurring payments  canceled

\-started tracking my day to day spending last month and found some areas that I can greatly reduce money outflow (eating out).

\-actively seeking a higher paying job

\-started selling some items online. This is unreliable, and I do not feel it can be factored into monthly income.

&amp;#x200B;

Best repayment method? I was considering the snowball (interest rates are all 20%, +-2%)

Should I consider a consolidation loan?

Should I be trying to put something into my savings?

Is it possible to defer student loan repayment? Should I consider this?

&amp;#x200B;

Any financial resources would be appreciated.

personalfinance,Back from military deployment. Need advice on what to do with extra money.,"Hello! I have posted here before and took some advice. 
While I was gone on a military deployment, I raised my Roth TSP to invest in my future. 
I am also not entirely new to the military so I am in the High Three retirement plan which I intend to pursue. 
Thanks to advice from this subreddit, I also invested heavily in a ""rainy day"" savings and accumulated 6 months of pay in a savings account. Granted, I'm enlisted so 6 months pay isnt too impressive.
A fellow military member also advised me to try a certificate from Navy Federal so I have one of those for 9 months to try it out. Additionally, i opened a mutual fund with USAA and so far have 100$ there. 
Even with all of this i still have money left over because i am not a party goer. I also dont have a family and live in the barracks. Aside from internet, student loan, and phone bill, I have no commitments. 
I was just wondering if there is any investment advice so I could grow my funds even more. I have considered buying a car recently to increase my credit and try joining the 800 club.

personalfinance,"35k in credit card debt, looking for help figuring out solutions","Hi there, 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 30 something person living on her own and just started a new job. My new job pays $55k a year (gross; with the potential for \~20% bonus a year over the summers). My income will likely go up about 2k a year with regular raises.   


I am in 35k of credit card debt due to surviving in graduate school. My credit card APR's range from 9.99 - 28%. I have already tried calling my credit card companies to negotiate lower rates to no avail.   


Here is my budget: 

Rent $600

Car $190

Car Insurance $70

Student Loans $500 

Gas $150 

Minimum payments across all cards: $964

&amp;#x200B;

This leaves me with between 700 and 1000 extra a month for anything else I might need (car repair, clothing, food, etc.).   


I set up an account with [undebt.it](https://undebt.it) and have estimated that it will take me about 4 years to pay off my credit card debt if I throw an extra $100 - $150 a month towards my debt. I wanted to know if it might be better for me, financially, to pursue other debt reduction strategies. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke with a Debt Management Company today, and they estimated my minimum payments across cards to be around the same amount as I am paying now, but they'd negotiate for my interest rates to be lower so I would be out of debt in 53 months without having to invest an extra $100 or $150 a month. This fee (close to $964) also includes the fee that they charge for helping me renegotiate my interest fees. Their fee is 65 a month. Do not know if this is high or typical of these kinds of companies.   


I'm worried about the impact enrolling in a debt management company and closing all my credit cards will have on my credit score and also whether the company will just take the money and run. They said that I would have to close my accounts and it would take about a month or so until they were able to renegotiate rates with my creditors. This means that for the first month, at least, I'd have to make double payments - one payment to keep myself current on my accounts  and one payment for them to pay off my debt monthly. 

I have three questions for the community:   


1. Does anyone have experience with a debt management company? Pros vs. cons? Any sketchy companies or behaviors to be aware of? 
2. Should I try to pay off the debt on my own? Not do a credit management company approach? 
3. Any other debt reduction strategies that y'all recommend?

personalfinance,"Focus on student loans, buying a house, or investing?","I've been out of school and working for a little over a year and due to roommates and being frugal managed to save about $20k out of my $55k income. I have this place until next summer and likely will be able to save an additional 15K by then. So far I've just let it grow each month in my account, but I really need to get an handle on it as a lump sum and sort out priorities. 

I have just under $60k in student loans that I've been making payments on for a few months. Part of me wants to put a big chunk down on that, however I'm also considering buying a house/condo next summer. The hesitation I have is I'm hoping to settle down and start a family in the next ~5 years, and any place I could afford now would definitely be too small. (1-2 beds start at $250k). I just don't know if it's worth the risk compared to renting, but having a steady place and not moving every year is really appealing. Alternatively, I could invest it. My student loans are all federal with half at about 6% interest and half at about 3%, so they aren't substantially more than market rates.

Inherited non-spousal pre tax 401k of $14,250 in 2019.

How?  (Married filing jointly $24,400 std deduction plus max 457 ($19,000) and  decent 403b contributions to lower earned income credit/max out tax credits). 

The issue is that I lose $2,600 or so in child tax credit (I miss out getting a check for $2,600 by claiming the $14,250 inheritance). 

I have gone through all variables and played around with different amounts of withdrawal in turbotax and cannot see a way around losing a good chunk of child tax credit ($2,800 max refundable child tax credit for 2019 for my two littles) to claim it.

My plan was to take $12,000 of the inherited money and invest it in my wife and I’s vanguard roth ira accounts for 2019 and the rest in 2020...  

Alternatively: I could take rmd’s instead at $350 ish per year and only lose $45 in tax credits annually for the forseeable future... but the current company charges nasty fees and is expensive... and I would still owe taxes on the withdrawals as it is not currently a ROTH. 

If I push the disbursment off too far down the road... may not have the EITC and child tax credits to cover any owed federal taxes... part of me thinks I should just take the hit now and the investment roth gains over time will exceed $2,600...

Bitcoin,This is why you should promote Bitcoin to people you know,"The other day at work we were having an emergency meeting which was called by the companies financial advisor. Apparently our entire company was at a huge risk of collapsing because we were still using an old system of storing our profits (cash).

The advisor was literally telling people what to expect in their severance packages and apologizing for losing their jobs when I interrupted and asked, ""Have any of you people considered using Bitcoin?"".

The CEO who was in the room initially scoffed at me, saying that most types of technology are over his head, but I assured him, ""It's simple, Sir. We can use Bitcoin not only to store our profits, but also to replace our internal networks, to verify our documents, host our websites, store our data, provide a layer of cyber-security to our environment (P2P), send any amount of bitcoin to other companies absolutely free and instantly, all while Bitcoin doesn't even rely on electricity or traditional network technologies to work - . . "",

""Stop,"" the CEO abruptly interrupted, ""Can you implement this immediately?"" he asked me. I immediately got up and pulled up my portfolio on my phone(I've been invested since early 2018) and showed him not only that I myself OWN bitcoin, but that I have the technology in the palm of my hand (literally).

He immediately handed me a manilla folder with all of the companies asset accounts and instructed me to follow him to the advisor's office. He told me I would be converting every single one of our operations to using bitcoin instead and that this would be implemented immediately.

The best part of this day was when the advisor was trying to follow us back to what (was) his old office. The CEO turned around and said, ""Can we help you with something?"". The advisor immediately broke down in tears. I decided to intervene and I at least asked the CEO not to fire the advisor for his ignorance, but he got fired anyway 🤷.

When the advisor was being escorted out of the office, I shouted out, ""Hey Dumbass, maybe next time don't use your archaic technologies to run things,"" and literally the entire office burst out laughing. Even the receptionist who the advisor was dating was laughing at him.

The CEO turned to me and said, ""This is your new office now"". ""You're making me an advisor?!"" I asked. ""No, I'm making you Chief Financial Officer of this company."" I was soo happy. I went to shake his hand but he literally took a step back and saluted me!

personalfinance,Looking for advice on dealing with my family's debt,"So, I am new here. I am neither a US citizen nor living in the US. I decided to make a Reddit account because I heard that many young people in the US have debts, so I need some advice or just a little support. I am 25 years old, female, and living in one of the SE Asia countries. My family is poor, and just like my username, I am a firstborn child. Since I was in elementary school, I knew about my family's financial situation. I was kinda smart, not a genius, but just above average. So, I get many scholarships and financial support from the local community/school/organizations. I got almost full scholarships from elementary school to high school and full scholarship in university. I work as a tutor in high school and freelance writer since my first year in university. I thought that I was doing great and preparing my final paper, then shocking news came two years ago. My parents were in debt and not just one but several debts from family members, friends, local communities, and loan shark companies. It was a huge shock. They probably just pay less than one year of tuition and bought me uniforms. I bought my books with pocket money. Most of my clothes were given to me. They did have to pay for my brother's tuition, but I never thought that they can't support us. Turns out their small street food vendor business was never good. The profits are getting less each year, and they have to support my grandma alone without the help of their siblings. Plus, their siblings were angry at them because they get grandma's house so they asked my parents to pay the repairment cost of my grandma's house with interests! My parents tried to negotiate with their siblings by saying they don't want the house, but they insist on their demand.

I need to postpone my studies. I work full time, no, overtime job to pay off all of their debts. The total debt is around $20,000 and so far I paid $12,000. It's been almost two years. I work as a freelance writer for my friend. He's an internet/marketing genius. He's got many international clients and I was hired to write articles for their websites. He's been very generous to me. In my city, the average pay for a full-time job for high school graduated is around $200. But I got paid around $700-$800. I've postponed my study for one and a half years, so I can only take one semester (this semester) off. If I still want to graduate, I need to finish my paper and some of the classes this semester and graduate next year. The only debts left now are from two loan shark companies. These are not even registered because the interest rate is too high. I want to graduate, but I have to pay $700 for the debt every month. I live with my parents to save money so all my income can be used to pay the debts. I can't switch to work part-time, I can't even imagine the interest!

I am very frustrated and feel so helpless. I don't know what to do. Banks won't help because I am a freelancer, no collateral. I just paid the local communities the debts my parents owned three months ago. I don't trust my extended family. They're asking for interests for the money used to renovate their mother's house. I try to look for online loans from other countries that offer long term payment so that I can at least have some savings. But, no such thing exists. Are there any communities out there that can help someone from outside their country? Any advice welcome!

P.S Sorry for the grammar. It's probably messed up. Hopefully, my post is still understandable. And please be nice to me. Thank you :)",finance

personalfinance,How aggressively should I pay off my student loans?,"I just graduated college in May and started my first job a couple of weeks ago. I get paid bi weekly, and my take home pay per pay period after taxes + health insurance is about $1700. So total of around $3400 per month.

My monthly rent (including all utilities) is $400. I pay $35/month for my cell phone plan, average $75/month on gas, $28/month for birth control pills, and probably about $150/month on food (could probably spend less, but I eat out a lot haha). No other loans or credit card debt.

$3400 (monthly pay) - $688 (total bills) = $2712

My question is, how much of that $2712 should I put into my student loans? I want to pay it off as soon as possible (1.5-3 years???), but would also like to put in some money towards my individual savings + my joint savings with my other half. My other half is in his 2nd year of med school and will graduate with 200k+ in student loans, but I don't even want to think about that until after I'm done paying off my own debt lmfao.

I don't have any private loans, just federal. For some reason, my status says that I'm still in school until 8/2020. In that case, should I focus on paying off the unsubsidized loans with the highest interest rates first? I would appreciate any advice. Thank you!

(posted my loans down below. I hope it's not confusing)

personalfinance,Am I gonna get slammed on taxes this year?,"So I was looking at tax brackets and noticed despite not claiming any withholdings (having the max amount taken) I only have about 20% taken from my paychecks biweekly. 

The previous tax year, my wife and I filled jointly and made about $40,000 between us but had $12,500 taken out pre tax since I was in nursing school at the time.  For reference, we live in New York. 

This year however, I am a hired RN who will make about $57,000 and she will make a salary of $38,000. However, when I look at the brackets, it says for federal we should have 24% taken. 

My question is, am I going to get slammed come tax time and owe alot? Also, how could this happen considering my wife and I both have Federal and State take the full amount? Is it because we have had such a jump in earnings that they put us in the wrong class based on previous year’s tax information?",finance

personalfinance,"Inheriting ~$30,000 from parents' estates, wipe away all my debt or save/invest?","Hi PF, my dad passed away last year, and after leaving it alone for a few months I've taken up handling his and my mom's estates. My mom passed away back in 2011, but my dad never finished handling her estate, so their property was still in both their names. According to the probate court, the probate waiting periods are satisfied and I'm very close to having the 5 acre lot they jointly owned in hand, which currently has a mobile home on it, and I have a neighbor that is still very interested in buying the property. Their offer is $30,000. The land is not in the best place, so my neighbor is probably my best prospect for getting rid of this land. My state does not have an inheritance tax for real estate, and I think I would qualify for the home sale tax exclusion as I lived there until June this year.

This is a long term planning question mostly since the money is not in hand yet, but currently I have ~$6000 of credit card debt all on awful 26% interest rate cards, expenses I racked up after my dad passed away when I was out of work and severely depressed. I also have a precomputed car loan through Ally currently at $20,000 on year 2 of 6 that I am very upside down on (2016 Hyundai Veloster Turbo, car is worth $12k at the most, went in zero down while getting screwed on the value and no trade-in and my dad's advice was ""go for it""). Continuing to make the regular minimum payments, the loan would cease being upside down January 2022. I have double-checked, and the loan has precomputed interest so payments above minimum do not apply directly to the principal.

Out of $2800/mo take-home pay, currently a minimum of $750 is going toward debt. I am not having difficulties paying this currently, but I'm tired of being under this debt. The credit card debt is going away no matter what, leaving me with $24,000. Would it be better to eliminate all of my debt including my car loan and keep the remainder of about 2 months of take-home pay as an emergency fund, or keep my $450 car payment after eliminating my credit card debts leaving $24,000 to put into some long-term savings? Are there any alternative paths I could take with this or other things I am not considering?",finance

personalfinance,Money Market vs. High Yield Savings Account for Emergency Fund,"I'm trying to understand the rates that are currently being offered by some of the online high yield savings accounts, as they appear to be better than what I have been earning on my emergency fund, which I have in Vanguard's Prime Money Market fund. The one month yield on that fund was 1.77% the last time I checked, while I have seen high yield savings accounts recently with interest rates up to 2.46%. This doesn't make sense to me, as I would expect that banks shouldn't be able to offer higher yields on a savings account than riskier (at least comparatively), non-FDIC insured money market funds. Am I missing something here? Is there any reason I shouldn't transfer my emergency fund into a high yield savings account? It's about $20K, so minimum balances shouldn't be an issue.

I appreciate any insight - most of the research I have tried to do on why high yield savings accounts might outperform money market returns have mostly turned up ads for high yield savings accounts and articles about which savings accounts are best.",finance

personalfinance,Take out a loan or pay in full?,"Hi,

I'm a tad stumped on what to do in my particular situation. 

I am looking to go back to school (its a trade school). The cost of the program is about 18K. I currently have $800 in checking and $40K in savings. 

Here is the breakdown of my expenses:

I currently do not have any debt, I paid off my student loans a few years back. I have a small credit card bill which I'll pay at the end of the month. My credit score, if this helps, is mid 700s.

Rent: $350 (No I don't live in a shoebox, I spilt rent with my partner.)

Food: $100

Internet:$ 60

Enjoyment:$80-$120


I would go to the trade school at night. I would work during the day at my current job where I make $14 an hour.

I believe  have 3 choices:
1) Take out a loan for 18K through FAFSA, the interest rate would be about 4-5%.

2) Drop 10k, take out a loan for 8k. Pay off 8K through payment plan after I graduate. 

3) Drop 10K, take out loan for 8K. Pay off the 8K as soon as a graduate through savings.

I'm leaning toward choice 3.
Any input on this?

Feel free to ask any questions to clarify.",finance
personalfinance,"Car needs a $630 repair, don't have the money for it. Use credit card and pay it off slowly?","Okay, so my usual practice with using credit cards is to have it paid off in full.

However, I just found out my cars starter is going bad, and I'm afraid that one day it's just going to not start at all. I live on top of a steep hill, with a narrow as fuck street, and I commute to and from work everyday on a very busy highway.

My mechanic, who I trust and I've gone to for a while now, inspected my car because I needed an oil change and I told them to check out why my car takes effort to start. They diagnosed a bad starter and quoted 630 for parts, labor and taxes. I can't afford this right now, and it's not like I have the money for a new car.

So I was just thinking, that since this is an emergency situation, I'd like to get this replaced ASAP. So my plan is to put it on my credit card, and take money out of my savings (I have 2, one for bills, rent etc and another for long-term savings) account every month until I pay it off. I'm thinking of paying $200 every month, which means it would take roughly 3 months to pay it off.

I don't usually buy shit, so my credit card debt is never high.

What do you guys think? Is this a good practice, or would the interest rate kill me? Please recommend.",finance
investing,GEO Group and Underlying Financials,"A week or so ago I posted a financial analysis of WeWork and found it so interesting I thought I would do another. If this becomes a routine, I'll choose these based on whatever is in the headlines recently. So there really is no science to selecting the companies.

In today's case, I thought it would be interesting to look into GEO Group, one of the largest for-profit private prison operators in the United States. I want to be absolutely clear at the start, there are many viewpoints on the industry and many of them are valid. I am going to side-step all the legal, moral, and/or ethical issues with the industry and only focus on the financial profile of the company. This is not to discount those concerns, but to acknowledge they are beyond my expertise and experience. So, without ado:

GEO Group (or GEO) operates as a Real Estate Investment Trust that owns or manages 133 facilities with [97,000 beds](http://investors.geogroup.com/Cache/1500123743.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1500123743&amp;iid=4144107). Beyond the U.S., they also operate facilities in the [UK, Australia, and South Africa](https://imgur.com/KBGwZ1R). Of the 133 facilities, 78 are owned outright by GEO, 20 are leased, and 35 are only managed (meaning, they provide all the services but the building). To quote from their Annual report ""We operate the seventh largest correctional system in the U.S. by number of beds, including the federal government and all 50 states."" [p. 8 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/923796/000119312519050054/d663410d10k.htm) One of the main reasons this has come up in the news lately, is that ~20% of the beds (19k) are used by [ICE](https://imgur.com/ZNzxFXZ). This is one of the key reasons why even banks are starting to [flee](https://www.forbes.com/sites/morgansimon/2019/09/30/geo-group-runs-out-of-banks-as-100-of-banking-partners-say-no-to-the-private-prison-sector/#76a328613298). Additionally [here](https://www.newsweek.com/u-s-spending-private-prisons-geo-group-increase-immigration-detention-1461067).

From a revenue perspective, the most basic unit of measure for the industry is Mandays, or the number of days per period that a bed can house an inmate. In other words, 1 bed for 1 quarter represents 90 mandays. Of their 123 owned or leased facilities, GEO has [~4.56mm](https://imgur.com/iqN8VPL) **compensated** mandays. Since 2015, their underlying capacity has increased at ~8% CAGR, which is driving a major portion of their revenue growth along with increases in usage. Stunningly, their revenue was $2.4B for the last twelve months, having grown from $1.8B in FY2015.

Looking a step deeper, their facilities generate $75 - 80/day/inmate for their secured facilities and community facilities. When it is a facility that they do not own, that drops to ~$50/day/inmate. For context, CoreCivic, one of their largest competitors reported that it was [$79.77/day/inmate](https://imgur.com/n3FwmyG) in their June 30 quarterly report, while the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported that it was [$99.45](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/30/2018-09062/annual-determination-of-average-cost-of-incarceration) for federal inmates. At $80/day, the annual cost for an inmate is $29.2k, which is in line with the estimated taxpayer cost per inmate from [Vera Institute of Justice](https://www.vera.org/downloads/Publications/price-of-prisons-what-incarceration-costs-taxpayers/legacy_downloads/price-of-prisons-updated-version-021914.pdf) on [page 10](https://imgur.com/ITtFfht). 

The net operating income margin depends on the segment (or operating margin specific to the segment, before D&amp;A and G&amp;A overhead expenses). For example the secured facilities have an operating margin of 30 - 33%. So, of the $80/day, GEO earns $24/day. While managed facilities are much closer to a 10 - 13% margin, earning ~$5/day/inmate.

Implicitly in this, then, is that there are two factors that relate to the outlook: [incarceration rate](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png) in the areas that they build their facilities and [average prison sentence](http://apps.urban.org/features/long-prison-terms/demographics.html). 

From a corporate standpoint, netting out all the corporate overhead expenses, the companies operating margin has held relatively steady around 10 - 13%. In the last twelve months, EBIT was $312mm (on $2.4B of revenue). The company spends approximately $130mm/year on CapEx and $20mm in the last twelve months on working capital (mostly due to receivables). As a result, the company generated $275mm of (free) cash flow over the last year.

The next question will be, what does it take them to get there, or how much did they have to invest to generate that $275mm. Looking at their June 30 financials, the company has $2.7B of debt and $1B of stockholders' equity. So $275mm on $3.75B of invested capital shows a healthy 8% return on capital. Their debt is a comfortable 4.9% WACD. Assuming a beta of [0.92](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GEO/key-statistics?p=GEO), an ERP of [5.2%](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/), and a 10yr Yield of [1.6%](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) results in a 6.4% cost of equity. Given that they only paid $8mm in cash taxes in 2018 (note: this was already netted out of the free cash flow), I'll assume 20% for the marginal tax rate, resulting in a WACC of 4.6%. So fundamentally, GEO had an economic profit of 7.9% ROC - 4.6% WACC or 3.3% on their $3.75B of capital. As a reminder, as a REIT, GEO is required to distribute &gt;90% of its taxable income to shareholders. So their ability to accrue cash for headwinds may be limited.

One interesting note looking at their capital structure, the $2.7B debt is currently rated B1 by Moody's, which would fall into the category of highly speculative bonds with their yields in the [9%+ range](https://imgur.com/qZypm9J). Moody's recently did a credit rating review and noted the ""unpredictability of long term federal and state government policy toward incarceration. Moreover, the private corrections sector remains vulnerable to adverse events and public scrutiny"" [source](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-announces-completion-of-a-periodic-review-of-ratings-of--PR_400872). Companies with this sort of credit rating have a 5yr cumulative default rate of 16% ([exhibit 44 here](https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1156859)), which reflects their potential exposure to public perception and state/federal budget issues despite sustained contract renewal rates. In 2020 alone, 7000 beds will be up for [rebid](https://imgur.com/dnSMnS2), which could represent 7,000 x 365 x $80 = $204.4mm of revenue.

TL;DR GEO Group, one of the largest private prison operators in the U.S., is surprisingly large and profitable but faces significant uncertainty around perception issues and government budgeting. As per usual, excel available if requested. Source [charts here](https://imgur.com/a/UN3Wrzr).

personalfinance,Help me understand if/when it makes sense to break my lease to purchase a home,"My wife and I have been renting in a high COL area for the past 3 years. Our rent has always been high and was bumped higher when we signed our lease this past year and had to add another parking spot to the lease after my wife got a new job. The reality is we were ready to purchase a house when we signed our lease, but we just didn't have the time to commit to looking for a house due to some family and work issues we had going on at the time. Now things have slowed down and unfortunately we are locked into a lease that expires in May of next year.

We've considered just breaking our lease but the contract stipulates that they can charge us up to 2 months rent as a fee for breaking our lease and I 100% expect them to follow through on that (this is what happens when you rent from a corporation instead of an actual person). So between the fee and that months rent we'd be looking at paying almost 10% of our down payment to get out of our apartment which seems crazy to me.

Seems like an easy decision right? Just wait out the lease and don't throw away 10% of the down payment.  Except for the wrench in the works, which is interest rates. We both have excellent credit so I think we'd be able to capitalize on the crazy low rates out there right now. I know that it's impossible to predict where rates will be in May, and that they may be even lower, but I have always been a 1 on the hand is worth two in the bush kind of guy. If we were to get the loan now and rates went back up then we'd almost certainly recover the money we lose in the fee.

So I guess I'm just looking for an outside perspective because my head is spinning on this right now.",finance
personalfinance,I am wanting to refinance a student loan and need some advice!,"Hiya Reddit.

I'm very new to reddit, but I quickly found the Assistance feed and I love the idea of this place. As it happens, I need some advice.

Here's the grimey finance numbers that everyone says you're supposed to keep to yourself!

My current balance on my student loan (private, not federal) is $51,849.39. This is split between 3 separate loans (23,872.87; 20,046.75; 7,921.77) and combined my minimum payments monthly are $756.72.

That's A LOT to pay per month. This is due to outrageous variable monthly interest ranging from 10%-12% interest. I have had ENOUGH of this! My original loan was around 70,00 and at this rate, I'll have paid around 230K when it's all finished.

My request isn't for money or anything ; it's actually for research information. I'm diving deep into researching refinancing options (mostly online, but I'm looking into a few local options as well) and I'm just needing some advice from anyone who has refinanced a student loan before.

What are places that I should look into ; more importantly, who should I avoid?

I should note that at this point in my life, I have no way of refinancing without a cosigner (my amazing parents are willing). I've been paying off my loans for about 5 years now and I've made a small dent in my loans, but due to the high monthly rate and rent, I've had to live paycheck to paycheck for these 5, so I have no collateral. I do have okay credit (691 last I checked).

So with all that, I would deeply appreciate any insight the lovely reddit world might have! :)

personalfinance,Am I in jeopardy of a continuing scam?,"A few weeks ago, I noticed there was a charge to one of my credit cards that neither I nor my wife authorized.  It was something like $29. The company, Shutterstock,  is legitimate.  Customer service there would not give me any information about whoever may the charge. So, I just went ahead and disputed it with my cc bank and it issued a new card.  Around the same day as that charge, I received an email from FedEx notifying me of a delivery coming from Mint Mobile  (I get notices of anything addressed to me), then noticed a $60 charge on the card to Mint Mobile.  I disputed that charge as well, then exchanged emails with an ass at Mint Mobile and finally told her if they represented to the cc company that the charge was kosher, I’d report them for fraud.  Mint Mobile wouldn’t provide information about who made the charge.

I am guessing the order was for a sim card.  I managed to deflect delivery and Fedex returned it to Mint Mobile.  Initially, I thought someone might have placed some orders and made a mistake putting in the cc info, but that doesn’t explain how a sim card or any order would be sent to me at my address.  But, why would a scammer place an order and have it sent to me?  I suppose it could be someone local who planned to snatch it from my front door when delivered, but what would make a measly sim card worth that effort?  Would it pave the way for further fraud?

&amp;#x200B;

Direct Sub. Staff. Loan	 2,370.00 	3.40%

Direct Sub. Staff. Loan	 3,500.00 	3.40%

Direct Sub. Staff. Loan	 5,500.00 	3.86%

Direct Unsub. Staff. Loan	 9,082.98 	6.60%

Direct Unsub. Staff. Loan	 1,009.21 	6.60%

The real painful ones are the $21.4k, $13.7k, and $9k loans. Bigger loan balance, larger rate.

I'm very potentially considering simply refinancing those three larger loans in order to try to obtain a lower fixed rate on either a 10-yr or 5yr repayment plan. The rest of my loans, particularly the Direct Sub. Stafford Loans, are very manageable in both size and interest rate. 

I've been prequalified for rates using Education Loan Finance, Earnest, and Sofi and was offered the following FIXED options (I have no interest in variable):

EDUCATION LOAN FINANCE:

5Yr Refi, $784.73 monthly payment at 4.59%

7yr Refi, $584.59 monthly pmt at 4.54%

10yr Refi, $436.50 monthly pmt at 4.56%


EARNEST

5Yr Refi, $774.91 monthly payment at 4.07%

7Yr Refi, $584.59 monthly pmt at 4.19%

10yr Refi, $432.34 monthly pmt at 4.35%

SOFI


5Yr Refi, $799.71 monthly payment at 5.119%

7yr Refi, $607.92 monthly payment at 5.469%

10yr Refi, $473.06 monthly payment at 6.070%


All of these rates were given with me only requesting a quote for the $42k total that would be the sum of my three largest loans (if I only refinanced those three and kept the rest through FedLoan Servicing). I'm most interested in the five year options and, of course, Earnest appears to be the best option for me based on prequalification alone. 


My bigger problem is that I'm having a hard time comparing apples to apples. My loan servicer, FedLoan, apparently can't tell me what my minimum payments are on each individual loan. I can do a simple TMV calculation for a 10yr loan and get what those payments are, but I'm not sure those numbers translate for whatever reason. It appears that my minimum payment for the remaining loans (all ten loans minus the three bigger ones) would be somewhere in the ballpark of ~$350. Plus the $775 option for the 5yr with Earnest, the total I would be paying a month would be around $1125.00. IMPORTANTLY, the cheapest repayment option offered through FedLoan is the ""Graduated Repayment Plan"", where the Starting Payment is $435.99 with the ""highest payment"" being $1,302.67 over the course of 119 payments (~10yrs). I was thinking that I could do this ""minimum payment"" option and apply the remaining $689 that I'd be repaying anyways through financing ($1125 that I'd be repaying total if I refinanced the three largest loans minus the $435.99 with the graduated repayment option) to the balance of the more aggressive loans, it might actually be cheaper to stay with FedLoan and not refinance at all. But I'm unsure how to run the numbers on that and know definitively.  


Do you believe refinancing, generally, would be advantageous for me? If any of you know how to run the numbers, could you maybe walk me through how to figure out exactly how much I'd be saving in interest by doing so? Also, if I refinance, will I be penalized for prepayments? I want to be as aggressive as possible and minimize interest paid and the term of the loan itself.",finance

Ripple,Congress questions The Fed,"Please do clarify in a form of a commend if you think this is good news or bad, since I am kind of confused about what to think, having read the article name and what the actual content says, mentioning Ripple.

Do you think that actually governments actually kind of begin to understand that the concept of blockchain is not to destroy the currencies, but actually reestablish trust in mother currencies and give people control over their money, and that banks should stop making money with money given from the people. Is this a new playing field for Ripple to actually cut off banks and work directly with the governments to create a transparent govement banking system. Is this a world where we can get credit based on smart contracts between the employer and the employee, supplied by the government, or am I just going mad at these hours 😅😅😅 

P.S. Saying all this about the credit system is because in countries without good financial stability and a huge gray sector, the banks are literally ripping off money from the working class people.

Exp: If you get a credit of 5000$ you would have to pay back 8000$ over a period of time in 5 years, with an average salary in the country being 500$. Lets not talk about cases where that sum of money is larger...This,the gray and the fact that we went from industrial country to being a country of traders sector, are the leading factors creating the inflation in my country and it cannot be stopped until the total deprecation of the mother currency.

Credit is not always bad, but it is when you give it to people without having any collateral and letting them spend it on literally anything, that would be worth nothing by the end they pay their debt to the people, which they kinda took from their selves, but the bank makes money from some fucging paradox money system called interests (yes, not the bank, but the people, because what fuels a bank is our money and the services that we want).

In college I went a little overboard, but I've learned a lot and am staying away from credit cards until I get this debt down. I have ~$15,000 or so in student loans, but the interest rate is small and I'm more worried about these cards for now before I start hitting the student loans heavy.

My credit score is hovering around 650. **I was thinking of either a loan to consolidate, or to pay off 1 by 1, but not too sure the best way to handle.**

investing,Trump has finally backed himself/market into a corner,"This impeachment thing is gonna weaken him going into 2020. With him on his heels from that, I cant imagine any reason China would let him off the hook with even a nothingburger deal before the election. Without a china deal, I dont see how the economy/market holds up another year. He could maybe have ran on a ""Us vs China"" msg with a weakening economy (temp pain for a greater purpose). But I highly doubt he can sucessfully run on ""Me vs Everybody"" (china, mexico, media, impeachment, etc, etc).

This entire rally since 2016 election has been predicated on tax cuts, deregulation, and general pro biz regime change optimism. Increasingly there's a very high risk of going the polar opposite direction in a year from now. I suspect the market views Biden + split congress as a tolerable swap (trade war resolution + less uncertainty, in exchange for less biz friendly administration). But if the lane continues to open for Warren, the market is gonna get very pessimistic.

Mix in the declining economic data, and limited fed bullets. **Now tell me what spares this bull, let alone pushes it another leg higher?**",finance
gaming,The Hunger for Cosmic Horror,"I really wish cosmic horror wasn't so hard to do right. That way there'd be more of it. I feel media as a whole is lacking in this area but especially games. I much prefer existential dread accompanied by an unnerving plot as opposed to games that just throw mindless jumpscares at you like the dips in a rollercoaster. You climb your way up and plateau in relative safety, then drop suddenly and then everything is fine again. I want horror that follows me as I play a game. Not as a physical entity but as an unnerving idea that the game planted previously and is letting flourish until the next tidbit of information that leads to some deep realization is drip fed to me until the eventual vague but complete climax of the story.

personalfinance,Is paying off student loan right after it being issued good or bad?,"Am currently second year in college and nearly $9k of federal loans has been issued to my name. $3k of them are unsubsidized loan with an APR above 5%.

Second group of unsubsidized loan are being paid off three weeks after it was issued and now listed as canceled. 

A small portion on the subsidized group had been paid. 

I’ve yet to see the second group of unsubsidized showing up on my credit report.

personalfinance,"Help, I’m unemployed due to an injury and chronic mental health disabilities and Younger me screwed me!","So, I went to college for a BFA in photography because everyone said go to college, get a degree life is so much better when you have that. Well, now I am 31, unemployed, recovering from a major hand surgery(almost released for normalcy), and I have chronic depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I have spent most of my adult life struggling with my mental health getting me into a place that just feels impossible. 

I defaulted on my Federal Student loans but have done the income based repayment option to get it out of default. I will be done in December with the default program and it will be transferred from the collection agency to a new servicer. I have no clue what my options are, how I will get through this, and how I can remedy this. Honestly, I just don’t know where to start, because this is just a portion 30k+ student loan debt. I have probably 40-50k+ in private student loans. I know this is insane and even worse when I tell you I went to a state school! I had the great advice to cover all your costs with your student loans so you’re not worried about rent, car payment, food, etc when you should be focused on studies. I also was immature when at 19-23 you find yourself with all this money and bought new computers, tv, a bike, and a lot of other stupid things. I have only consistently paid one of my private student loans with limited success in paying on time and am currently in my last forbearance option (I think). 

I also have outstanding medical debt of an unknown amount, debt from to car repossessions most recently in March of this year, and some credit card debt around 1k-1500k. I honestly just don’t know where to start. Added all up I think I’m pushing 80-100k in debt. 

I do want to say I have been seeking medical care and counseling for my mental health, I’m 9 months sober, I’m working as a volunteer graphic artist that will hopefully soon become a part-time paid position, I am currently talking with the co-founder of a small manufacturer that I would love to work for (should know something at 8:30-9am), and I’m 90-100% sure I have met my future wife. 

If you all could offer me advice about where to start, what I should look into, and what are my best options (caution morbid statement to follow) outside of killing myself? (Not suicidal, but I have been. I’ve found humor and especially self deprecating humor is cathartic.)

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Bitcoin,Can someone provide proof for this passage from The Bitcoin Standard?,"The following is a passage from The Bitcoin Standard:

&gt; A similar story happened with the aggry beads used as money for centuries in western Africa. The history of these beads in western Africa is not entirely clear, with suggestions that they were made from meteorite stones, or passed on from Egyptian and Phoenician traders. What is known is that they were precious in an area where glassmaking technology was expensive and not very common, giving them a high stock-to-flow ratio, making them salable across time. Being small and valuable, these beads were salable across scale, because they could be combined into chains, necklaces, or bracelets; though this was far from ideal, because there were many different kinds of beads rather than one standard unit. They were also salable across space as they were easy to move around. In contrast, glass beads were not expensive and had no monetary role in Europe, because the proliferation of glassmaking technology meant that if they were to be utilized as a monetary unit, their producers could flood the market with them—in other words, they had a low stock-to-flow ratio.

&gt; When European explorers and traders visited West Africa in the six- teenth century, they noticed the high value given to these beads and so started importing them in mass quantities from Europe. What followed was similar to the story of O’Keefe, but given the tiny size of the beads and the much larger size of the population, it was a slower, more covert process with bigger and more tragic consequences. Slowly but surely, Europeans were able to purchase a lot of the precious resources of Africa for the beads they acquired back home for very little.2 European incur- sion into Africa slowly turned beads from hard money to easy money, destroying their salability and causing the erosion of the purchasing power of these beads over time in the hands of the Africans who owned them, impoverishing them by transferring their wealth to the Europeans, who could acquire the beads easily. The aggry beads later came to be known as slave beads for the role they played in fueling the slave trade of Africans to Europeans and North Americans. A one-time collapse in the value of a monetary medium is tragic, but at least it is over quickly and its holders can begin trading, saving, and calculating with a new one. But a slow drain of its monetary value over time will slowly transfer the wealth of its holders to those who can produce the medium at a low cost. This is a lesson worth remembering when we turn to the discussion of the soundness of government money in the later parts of the book.

I tried finding proof for this detailing of how events unfolded, but can't seem to find a definitive agreed-upon source.

personalfinance,Tax Professional Help: How To Use Massive Business Expenses/Losses To My Advantage?,"Hi all, I am looking for some advice from tax professionals. I am currently in a sticky situation: I have $44k in credit card debt and $59k in federal tax debt from 2017.  I also took significant losses recently: I had capital gains losses of \~$100k in 2018 and I have business expenses of about $35k for 2019 (with hardly any revenue).

I recently heard a podcast in which Grant Cardone mentioned that he once bought a private jet and placed it as a business expense.  This massive business expense basically allowed him to not have to pay any taxes for the next 2.5 years.  I also heard that Donald Trump had \~$900 million in business losses/expenses one year which basically allowed him to not have to pay taxes for 5+ years after that.

My question is this: How can I use this massive capital gains loss and this massive business expense of mine to drastically decrease/eliminate my taxes for this year and possibly a few more?  This would be very helpful given the amount of debt that I am in. Just for reference, I make $70k/year at my job.

personalfinance,Can't decide what to make extra payments on and other financial questions.,"Hello all,
I am having a hard time deciding what exactly to do finance wise.
I own my home; however, I am not paid down to 20% so I still have PMI. If I were to refinance I would need an additional 15k so that I could drop the PMI and hopefully get a lower interest rate (currently 5%). 
I also owe around 11k on my car and although it has all the bells and whistles I am not really in love with it. I've owned it almost 2 years and have paid down the loan 10k already; however, I hesitate selling it because I made the silly mistake of going to the back finance room so I have quite a bit of additional insurance on the car. I would rather scrimp and outright buy a car. It seems like a waste of the extra 2k of additional insurances I bought.
One main question is, is it better to pay down on the house or the car?
Second main question, is it better that I am only currently contributing what my company will match on my 401k or is it better to max out my contribution even though that would take away my ability to make extra payments elsewhere?
Important tidbits: my house has gone up 10k since I bought it a year ago and I view that as an investment so a part of me would really like to pay down the primary balance. Also, my house is a bit older so I am constantly doing essential and costly maintenance and a part of me wants to sell it in 2-5 years.

Our realtor recently told us that interest rates have dropped to 3.75% for 30-year loan, and 3.25% for the 15-year loan. I am wondering if it is wise to re-finance once more, and if so, which option should we go for? 

Our current mortgage payment sits at ~2250, but we pay roughly $4000 total to put some extra money towards the principal. Our current total income is around $130,000 pre-tax (me at $76,000, him at $55,000). Other expenses are ~$200 for utilities, ~$250 for HOA, ~$300 for food, and ~$400 for miscellaneous. 

I'm thinking that if we qualify for re-finance, doing the 30-year loan at 3.75% would be more financially sound, but my husband wants to do the 15-year loan at 3.25%. His reasoning is that we already pay more than the mortgage amount of the 15-year loan (~$3200), so being on that loan would not affect our monthly mortgage payment. 

However, I'm concerned about the long run if our finances change (job loss, kids, etc), and how we would be stuck paying the mortgage every month on his take-home pay. We'd be basically breaking even and slightly in the hole for our expenses.

personalfinance,I have about 10 federal student loans. All but one are at the same servicer. Is it worth it to pay off the stray loan for peace of mind?,"So I have about $35k in federal loans - 9 of them are serviced through Navient and also have a Perkins Loan that is serviced by Heartland ECSI. The payoff balance on the heartland loan is exactly $5,500 and is the highest interest at 5% flat. My understanding of the avalanche method would lead me to believe that I should pay the minimums on all 10 loans; and then proceed to pay off the Perkins loan with any overpayments.

Here is where things get interesting. I have 3 accounts that are liquid:

**Checking Account for Bills/Fun** \- I typically keep one month's net salary here at all times

**Checking Account for Student Loans** \- I feel it is important to segment these funds. I keep about $5-6k here at any given time.

**Savings (ie. Emergency)** \- I have about 3 month's worth of expenses here

Usually, I will designate any leftover money at month's end to the Loans Checking rather than savings, as I also have a private loan to tackle - I usually end up paying about $1100/mo in total which is about 200 more than my comprehensive minimum. 

Would it be a bad idea to just pay-off the Perkins loan for $5,500 so that I can keep less accounts open? It is highest interest, but would effectively wipe my loans checking account clean. $600 goes into this account every paycheck. 

I could borrow some from my savings and pay myself back with interest over time as well (I usually 'finance' things from the Bank of Me... if that make's sense) - but am unsure if this would be wise or not.

personalfinance,Any risk in taking advantage of smaller banks higher interest rates on money market accounts? (USA),"Hi Everyone!

Long time lurker first time poster. I have about $700k in a money market account with a large bank. However it's only netting me less than 2% interest. It started great, about 2 years ago I was getting nearly 3%, but as the fed has been dropping interest rates, so has my bank. The marjority of this money is for a down payment on a house (we sold our home about 3 months ago and are looking to buy again in the next year or two), so I need to keep the money relatively liquid.

I was searching online for a better deal and found a few smaller banks like CFG Community Bank in Maryland, who are offering up to 2.3-2.51% interest rates.

So my question for you guys, is there any risk in choosing these smaller banks? They are all FDIC insured... but I feel like i read somewhere the cap on the insurance is like 100k. So I'm still nervous...

Thanks!

personalfinance,Should I cash out my retirement account?,"Financial advice wanted:

I just found out I have $27,781 sitting in my retirement account(IAP) from my old job (I haven't worked in 2.5 years). If I cash it out now I will get taxed 38%, so I will get $17,224. If I wait till 2050 it will get taxed 28%, so $20,002. If I wait it could also go up, or down, depending on the market. If I do apply to withdrawal it could take up to 120 days.

Other things to consider:
1.I am also going to be getting about $52k in back pay from social security soon. Any day now up to 2 more months.
2.I NEED to buy a new car and will probably be spending about $15k. And I need to fix my other cars and I don't know how much that will be.
3.I owe less then $29k on my house, but I have a VERY high interest rate and 9 more year on my loan. If I pay off my house early it will save me about $33k in interest and then $577 a month.
4.I have A LOT of home repairs I need to do. I would say about $10k. Front and back decks, new AC pump, re-shingle the roof, new stove/oven, fix washer, fix fridge/freezer.
5.I have terrible credit and might need to file for bankrupcy.

I live in Texas. At the beginning of June, I had to go to the ER when I was on vacation in California. The ambulance ended up being out of network and wanted to bill about $4200. My insurance scoffed at that amount and they have been fighting over the price ever since. I recently received a bill from the ambulance company saying that I owe the entire $4200 bill (my insurance assures me that the max I am responsible for is $860) and that it would be sent to collections soon.

I called the ambulance company and they stated (on a recorded line) that I need to set up a payment plan with them while they wait for my insurance company to pay. They told me the bill would be sent to collections on 10/6 if I did not pay. I told them I would consult my insurance company and call them back. I called ambulance company on 10/4 and was told the bill was sent to collections earlier that day.

What are my options here? I told my insurance company already and they called the ambulance company to request a call back on the debt collection. The ambulance company denied them that request and gave them the information of the debt collection company. I want to pay my portion of the bill and erase the debt from my credit record as I am getting ready to buy a car and want to get the best financing available.

I have never had a negative hit on my credit report. We have two existing mortgages (on our primary residence and an investment property) and aren't looking for more or to refinance. I can wait on the car if necessary or probably finance it using my wife's credit.

I'm 34, gross just over $100k annually and comfortably max contribute to my 401k and my HSA. Only monthly recurring debt is a $330 monthly payment on a 0% auto loan with $14k left. Cards paid off at end of every month.  I have a little over $80k saved up in cash right now and another $70K in my 401k.  Various other smaller accounts like the HSA with $5k and an old TSP plan with around $4k.

I also just got married and my wife has minimal debt but also minimal savings.  She has a worse credit profile than I (most models still have her in low 700's) but makes $65k annually.  Because of the credit profile potentially raising the rate she will not be included on the mortgage but will be on the title.

I'm under contract for a $300k home here just outside of Houston, TX (The Woodlands).  My two obvious choices here are to put down either 20% ($60k) and immediately negate PMI or 5% ($15k) and take on the extra $118 in PMI every month while immediately investing the $45k not utilized (I am keeping $20k in cash regardless of which decision made).  The extra $300 a month counting the PMI and higher payment due to higher principal is not going to affect our capacity to pay our bills.  I'm not looking into 5% because I can't swing 20% or the market is moving too fast here....I'm just trying to maximize my current cash situation.

I am not a professional investor and have no desire to bet on stocks hoping for 10% returns over the next 10 years.  Lower risk dividend producing stocks that I could reasonably expect 6% out of is my aim.  Is that obtuse?

I know some people have brought up before how 5% is such little equity that just a blip in the housing market the first year and now all of a sudden you are under water.  But the flip side of that is I only have $15k of my own money tied up in that investment...as opposed to $60k.  Who do you think the bank is going to move more quickly on if all hell broke loose and BOTH of us lost our jobs and we couldn't make payments on an under water home?  Just a low likelihood situation altogether we would need to get out from under the home under duress.  I work in healthcare and she facilitates inside sales for an industrial generator company here in Houston.  Not exactly economically volatile careers.

Please share any musings or insight into the matter.  Especially perspectives I may not be viewing this from.  I actually do believe we are in bit of a housing bubble as well as possibly due for a minor recession.  But to me, having that money in dividend stocks as opposed to wrapped up in a $200k+ loan gathering interest at only 3.5% is still safer, not only potentially more fruitful if I'm wrong.

personalfinance,Contribute to HSA or Pay Down Student Loans (in NJ),"Hi everyone,

I recently started a decent-paying job for the first time. I also now have access to a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) with an accompanying Health Savings Account (HSA). 

I also have no idea what I'm doing. 

As of today, I have around $114,000 in student loan debt (grace period ends in November):

* $10,000 private loan (4.25% interest)
* $66,000 federal stafford (ranging from 5.3-6.6% interest)
* $37,000 grad plus (6.3%-7.6%)

I was psyched to take advantage of the triple-tax-advantaged HSA, and was planning on using it as a retirement account. However, I recently learned that my new home state, NJ, is one of just two states that tax HSA contributions and gains.

I'm now wondering which course of action makes the most sense:

a) **Forget the HSA contributions for now** and just dump more $ toward the student loans

b) **Contribute to the HSA, but only invest in treasury bonds** --apparently gains on those are not taxed, even at the state level? Perhaps this would also entail modifying my Roth IRA and 401k allocation to include a higher stock-to-bond ratio


c) **Contribute to the HSA and allocate my investments like normal** (healthy mix of stock index funds and some bonds), taking advantage of the *federal* tax advantages -- and just deal with the state tax and the inconvenience of having to track my gains

Some additional info, if it's relevant:

- Almost 27

- Just started first legal job w/salary of 170k 

- I have half-baked aspirations of retiring early

- I have no savings yet other than the $6,000 that I dumped into a Roth IRA last year

- I plan to max out my 401k and backdoor Roth IRA every year in addition to (possibly) the HSA (though the firm doesn't contribute anything to the 401k)

personalfinance,Thinking about refinancing everything to shotgun pay it off.,"So I've got a house with plenty of equity in it, but I also own two pretty expensive cars. I think I can pay off the whole shebang really pretty quickly, but I just wanted to run it by a few hundred extra ears to catch anything I might be missing.

So the house is worth in the $500k range, I've got a 30 year loan on it (finished paying 2043) and owe $215,000 at 3.675%. Escrow total is $333/mo, Principal + Interest is $1,115/mo, total monthly payment is $1,447.

The first car is worth about $55k, balance of $16.5k @ 3.65% with 3 years left on the loan. Payment is $819/mo. 

The second car is worth around $100k, balance of $86k @ 3.49% with 5.5 years left on the loan, and total payment of $1,480/mo.

So my question is this. I was messing with some calculators and figured if I added the first car payment to the second car payment, then the second car would be paid off exactly one year early or June 2024. If I added both car payments to the mortgage in 2024, the house would be paid off in July 2029. I'd be paying the same ~$3,750/mo the entire time and be debt free in just under 10 years.

Well, then I got to looking and Chase is offering a 2.99% interest rate right now for a 15 year loan. I figured if I roll the house + both cars into this loan I could get a $323k loan (figure $9k closing costs rolled in?) for 15 years @ 2.99% interest. Throw this into online calculators, and add in the extra payments from the cars that I'd be savings ($2,300/mo) and it looks like I should be able to pay off the whole thing in 6.5 years, or July 2026.

So that's pretty much what I'm wondering. Is there any downside to going that way? I understand that I'd be losing the opportunity cost of investing that money in the market, but I'd still be contributing to my investments at the same pace as previously which I am very happy with and there's just something about being completely debt free which would be nice. Another benefit to consider would be my minimum monthly payment is currently $3745 for the next three years, $2,925 for the two years following that, and $1450 for the 5 years following. If I rolled them all into one, my minimum monthly payment in case of emergency would only be $2,200 for 6.5 years which would free up some money in case of emergency and extend considerably any emergency fund.

Thanks for keeping with this far, I hope I explained the situation well. It makes sense in my head and I'm tempted to start proceeding with the process but I wanted to run it by some others to see if there's any flaws in my reasoning. I might even be able to find an extra $1,000/mo to throw at it which would pay the whole thing off in 5 years and 4 months and that is definitely tempting...",finance

*****
&gt; Stocks will try to regain their mojo next week as China and the U.S. hold long-awaited trade negotiations in Washington.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9% this week while the S&amp;P 500 slid about 0.3%. Overall, the two averages posted their first three-week losing streak since August.
*****
&gt; Wall Street’s poor performance for the week comes after a disappointing U.S. manufacturing data report sparked fears of a recession. The report itself pointed to trade as a key source of weakness for the manufacturing sector, making next week’s trade talks the key focus for traders.
*****
&gt; “Trade talks are crucial, not just for the U.S., but globally,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The conclusion from central bankers, CEOs and CFOs is we’re slowing down.”
*****
&gt; “They are waiting for something constructive,” said Krosby.
*****
&gt; The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that U.S. manufacturing activity contracted to its lowest level in more than 10 years. This data sparked a two-day sell-off in which the Dow dropped more than 800 points. ISM Chair Timothy Fiore said trade “remains the most significant issue.”
*****
&gt; Trade tensions between China and the U.S. have heightened over the past year, with both countries exchanging tariffs on billions of dollars worth of their products. However, the tone around U.S.-China trade improved recently as China increased last month .
*****
&gt; White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow also said Friday that “positive surprises” could come out of next week’s negotiations. Chinese and U.S. negotiators are expected to meet next Thursday and Friday.
*****
&gt; But Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA Research, warned signs of progress are crucial for the market moving forward. “Markets have entered a ‘show me’ phase,” he said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Investors will also look ahead to the Federal Reserve releasing the minutes from its September meeting on Wednesday. The Fed cut rates last month by 25 basis points for the second time this year, citing “the implications of global developments for the economic outlook” among other factors.
*****
&gt; “It seems to me Powell is laying the blame or the explanation for the weakness directly at the feet of the administration,” said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark. “It’s growth outside of the U.S. It’s the parts of the U.S. economy that are exposed to trade that are being affected. Other than that, the economy is doing fine.”
*****
&gt; Nonetheless, the probability of a third Fed rate cut increased this week amid weaker-than-forecast services and jobs-growth data. Market expectations for an October rate cut rose to around 80% from about 50% in the previous week, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, ISM said the U.S. services sector grew at its slowest pace since August 2016. Meanwhile, data released Friday by the Labor Department showed slower-than-expected jobs growth in the U.S.
*****
&gt; Counterintuitively, the stock market got a boost after both data sets were released. The major averages posted solid gains on Thursday and rallied more than 1% on Friday with the Dow jumping more than 350 points.
*****
&gt; “With job growth decent but slowing, a contraction in manufacturing, the ongoing trade war, and low inflation, the Federal Reserve will cut the fed funds rate” later in October, said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, in a note.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 10/4/19

&gt; All-in-all, it was a pretty mixed week for economic data, specifically manufacturing and labor data. While Markit’s gauge on manufacturing was slightly stronger than both expectations and the August print, ISM’s version disappointed with little in the way of bright spots among its components. Hard data, on the other hand, is showing a bit of a different picture as Durable Goods appear healthy with the fastest 3m/3m growth rate since last November as we discussed in Thursday's Closer. The Markit Services PMI and ISM’s Non-Manufacturing Index were also split with Markit’s reading holding steady as ISM disappointed once again. Employment data was the other major focus of the week with similar disappointments, but some silver linings. Ahead of Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls Report, ISM’s Employment components for both the Manufacturing and Services sectors further weakened in September while this week’s initial jobless claims rose slightly more than expected (although continuing claims fell again). ADP’s reading on employment also fell more than expected. The NFP report followed suit showing fewer jobs added in September, but new lows in the unemployment rate and underemployment rate added to the case of continued labor market strength.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/100419-Eco.png))**

&gt; Economic data takes a bit of a breather next week with only two-thirds as many releases this week. Consumer credit is first up on the docket and is expected to moderate to $15 billion after a very strong print last time around. On Tuesday, we will get confidence numbers out of the small business world. NFIB’s Small Business Optimism is forecasted to fall to 102.5 from 103.1 in August. PPI is also out that morning, although no change is expected for both the headline and core numbers. CPI data is due to be released later in the week on Thursday and likewise, no change is expected. Further in inflation data, on Friday, import and export price indices are also scheduled to be released. In labor data, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) will come out on Wednesday followed by weekly claims numbers the following day. After rising to 219K this week, claims are expected to improve to 217K. Finally, Friday’s preliminary University of Michigan Sentiment for October will round out the week. It is expected to fall to 92.0 after last month’s rebound up to 93.2.

# Labor Market Chugs Along

&gt; The U.S. labor market keeps chugging along, despite signs of weakness in other pockets of the U.S. economy.

&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose 136,000 in September, and July and August payrolls growth were revised up by 45,000. The 12-month average payrolls change climbed to 179,000 including Friday’s data, still slightly higher than the expansion average.

&gt; Overall, the September jobs report showed hiring has been steady, defying recent worries of economic weakness after surprisingly weak manufacturing and services surveys were released earlier this week. Other labor-market measures also look healthy. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in September, a new cycle low, and initial jobless claims are still subdued.

&gt; Wage growth slowed notably last month, though, hinting that inflationary pressures could be moderating. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, average hourly earnings growth fell to 2.9% year over year, the slowest pace since July 2018.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wage-growth-slips_1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Slowing average hourly earnings growth could point to a cooling job market. However, average hourly earnings growth for production and nonsupervisory workers increased 3.5% year over year, indicating there could be temporary influences weighing down the overall wage measure. At any rate, 2.9% wage growth is still enough to buoy personal incomes and consumer spending while keeping interest rates at bay.

&gt; “Even though hiring has slowed slightly this year, it still looks healthy for the 10th year of this economic expansion,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Wages are growing near a 3% clip, and we still see evidence that domestic inflation is subdued enough to support an accommodative Federal Reserve.”

# October Most Volatile Month of the Year

&gt; Historically speaking, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) tends to reach its seasonal high in the month of October. This may be due to the fact that the two worst performing months of the year, August and September (by average performance) precede it. October also has the honor of slaying twelve, post-WWII bear markets. A bear market’s low is frequently accompanied by high levels of fear and market volatility. VIX’s seasonal pattern can be seen in the following chart. October’s peak and July’s low are indicated by blue arrows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d4228dac4015d5a36ad78a5f1e387ac/82d3c849ec28ac26-fb/s500x750/47de0619630baef67f78abd4e78de224db1526f8.jpg))**

&gt; October’s volatility peak is also visible when actual daily percent changes are analyzed. October has hosted the most daily moves in excess of 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 7% and even 10% since 1930. Do not fret over the nine times S&amp;P 500 has moved more than 10% in a single day. Six of the nine occurrences were way back in the 1930’s. Only three have occurred more recently and out of those, two were actually positive days (10/13/2008 +11.58% and 10/28/2008 +10.79%). Actually only two of the nine days with moves in excess of 10% were negative days: 3/18/1935 –10.06% and 10/19/1987 –20.47%.

&gt; Putting the table data into a bar chart adds a quick confirmation of October’s heightened volatility versus all other months.

# Some October Weakness Common in Pre-Election Years

&gt; It certainly did not take long for the market to trigger Octoberphobia this year. Tuesday’s soft manufacturing report was at least part of the trigger. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have already declined over 2.6% and its just the second trading day of the month. Tomorrow’s Non-Manufacturing ISM report and Friday’s jobs report could sooth some of the current recession fears and warrant close attention. However, market weakness in October, even in pre-election years is common. Our recent post showed October ranking second worst of all month in pre-election years.

&gt; October’s tepid history in pre-election years can also be seen in the following seasonal pattern charts. The only real notably difference between this year and past pre-election years is weakness has arrived earlier. Looking at the black line in each chart, the average pre-election year October pullback has been around 3% for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. A larger pullback this year would not be out of the question considering trade, growth and political uncertainty. If economic data proves resilient, then the usual end of year rally enjoyed in past pre-election years will likely materialize.

personalfinance,how do I invest within my Vanguard brokerage account and what should I invest in? (24),"I’m 24 years old, living in a Midwestern city, making about $40k per year. No debt, and no immediate plans to go back to school. I have $8k in an IRA, $20k in my regular savings account, and $6k in a Vanguard brokerage account. 

I set up the last in January and put in $3k because I thought I should have some investments that aren’t tied up until retirement. But I didn’t know what to do (and I think didn’t even know how on the website) so I left it all in “short term reserves” within the account. I think it’s in a federal money market fund now? It has made $43 since January, and I have it all my accounts set to reinvest dividends.

personalfinance,A couple simple (and probably dumb) questions.,"Hello all, I had a few unrelated questions.

Yesterday I was approved for a personal loan of $4500, this will eliminate our credit card debt with half the interest rate. From what I read, it seems better to pay large chunks versus paying off everything at once (please correct me if I'm wrong). If this is correct, how often should I pay the credit card bills to effectively pay it off? Should it be monthly like any other bill or would weekly be better? 

Second question: my husband and I have decided to switch to Mint Mobile from T-Mobile but when is the best time to switch? Before the next bill or after we pay it? (I know this is a dumb question so thank you to anyone who answers it. I'm trying to minimize the cost as much as possible).

personalfinance,Question regarding health insurance rebate check,"Hey all,

I'm hoping that someone on this subreddit can provide clarity on the issue outlined below.

I received a rather large rebate check in the mail from my health care provider for TY 2018 as they did not meet the 80/20 threshold as mandated by federal law. This was an individual, non-employer sponsored plan purchased from the Marketplace (ACA). 

The rebate check is MUCH larger than my out of pocket premiums because I had a premium tax credit for 2018 so I contacted the insurer and they said the check amount is correct because the rebate amount reflects 16% of the total individual premiums paid by me plus that percentage of the PTC paid on my behalf by the government.  They are apparently required to follow this calculation by the federal govt.

They also mentioned there may be tax consequence for my 2019 taxes however, they also said that they will not send a 1099 to the IRS nor will the Health Insurance Marketplace send out a revised 1095-A form to me or the IRS.

This can't be right.  This is the government's money and I'd imagine that they want it back. What should I do here? I was thinking of depositing the check and setting those funds aside for now until I file my 2019 taxes. Thing is, I have already reconciled the PTC with the IRS for TY2018 and without a newly issued 1095A, I'm not sure how to proceed.  Anyone here ever been in this situation?  If so, how is this handled from a tax perspective?

Thanks for answering!

financialindependence,"We make $150k/year, yet our Effective Federal Tax Rate is 6.34%. How is this possible?","My wife and I make $150,000 combined. The standard deduction for married filing jointly is $24,400. And together we put in $38,000 to our Traditional 401(k)s and $7000 into our HSAs. This means **$69,400** (*$24,400+$38,000+$7,000*) is shielded from federal taxes, which leaves **$80,600** (*$150,000-$69,400*) left to be taxed normally.

According to [2019 Tax Brackets](https://www.creditkarma.com/tax/i/2019-tax-brackets-things-to-know/) we are taxed at **10%** on the first $19,400 (*$1,940*), **12%** from $19,400 to $78,950 (*$7,080*), and **22%** from $78,950 to $80,600 (*$484*).

Which means that for 2019 we will only pay **$9,504** (*$1,940+$7,080+$484*) in federal taxes.

Which means that our Effective Federal Tax Rate for 2019 will be **6.34%** (*$9,504/$150,000*). Is this legit?! How is this possible?? That seems so low.

But I understand this isn't taking into account FICA (Social Security and Medicare) payroll deductions, so just looked it up and apparently [FICA](https://www.adp.com/resources/articles-and-insights/articles/e/eow-social-security-wage-base-for-2019-announced.aspx) is **7.65%** for 2019 (up to $132,900 in income per individual and neither of us come close to that). So that would be the true total tax rate of **13.99%** (*6.34%+7.65%*), which is INSANE!

I had no idea our effective federal tax rate would be so low. I was just playing around with my FIRE spreadsheets and wanted to share my findings and possibly get a second opinion in case I was missing something major.  Up to now I've just put a very conservative tax rate of 20% in my spreadsheet, but when I adjusted the formula reflect the actuals, it moved up our FIRE date by two years - which is definitely significant.",finance

We also want to buy another house, which is bigger, so we can expand our family. We can afford around $800-900/month for that (obviously dependent on if/when we have kids and any sort of raises we get). The issue we are having is my bank that I have been with for forever (and my parents bank through them, so I have a really good relationship with them) can only secure the interest rate for 5 years. So basically we would have to refinance every 5 years, which could screw us over if interest rates raise. **We have already been approved for this loan. 

My husband found another bank that is military friendly (he is in the national guard), would require no downpayment through the VA loan, has a lower interest rate, and can secure it for 15/30 years. But we have no relationship with this bank at all. **We have not been approved for this loan but with our credit scores it should be a nonissue.

I search high an low for about an hour for a way around, or over or under the water to get there. No foreseeable way to get over to the desert in sight.

gaming,"AAA studies are slowly falling apart at the seams.... [rant, XL]","Hear me out okay. If AAA studios keep doing complete messes of complied code there are three outcomes: 

1)another video game market crash where most non indie studios fall

2) [the most likely scenario], the major studios, like EA and Ubisoft to beat the same tired old dead horse bandwagon, will fall and smaller or studios/companies retaining their consumer base will continue on unabated while making room for newer dev teams and independent companies

Or finally 3) the major studios (like EA for sake of argument) realize how unsustainable their future market is possibly going to be with how rushed jobs and too many microtransactions and make games like before maybe with an increased price of 80 or 90 but they give a well made finished product

Here me out, I get it video games are expensive and despite the problems some people might have with EA their recent addition to Star Wars Battlefront franchise feel like Star Wars, sound like Star Wars, and look damn fine. Past that you could argue microtransactions and pay to win and shallow game play and piss poor solo campaigns. 

Take Bioware and Mass Effect: Andromeda. Or don't cause that wasn't even a joke. It was a hobbled together mess of production with poor management and unskilled developers. They had to put more experienced employees back onto the game to patch it back together AFTER launch. THEY LAUNCHED IT BROKEN AS ALL HELL. And that's just technical issues not including the bad writing and terrible characters and just lazy everything. Sure the third game went down in quality what with the ""pick red, blue, or green ending"" but that's also cause the story lead was removed from the project after the first two games and he envisioned the story in ME3 to continue further with the whole dark matter and dark energy from ME2.

However, with other messes and blatant lies like Fallout 76 and everything shady about that (paid for a real canvas bag? Cute, here's a cheap nylon string back. We totally won't face backlash for it.............) and how the recent few COD black ops wait for reviews to come out to say nice things about it before rolling out the microtransactions. Throw in now the most recent Ghost Recon. It's microtransactions with some game play. Just wait until it's pay for an any animation past T-pose.

My point is these big studies are pushing out unfinished products laden with microtransactions making a quick buck. I know games are expensive but this practice isn't sustainable. 

Eventually enough people will be fed up and will either wait for the mess to see the light of day or just not waste money on the game and spend it on other actually finished products instead. 

I know for everyone one person not buying there's nine more paying the extra hundred bucks for the deluxe special whatever or other. But they aren't made of money and wallet fatigue as well as consumer cynicism is setting in as more and more unfinished programs made to push microtransactions come out.

personalfinance,"I think my car loan may have been approved by mistake, what should I do?","Hey guys,

At the beginning of August, I walked into a dealership and walked away with a used 2015 Kia Soul on a $14,000 loan. My old 1998 Ford Expedition wasn't worth enough for a trade-in (""we'll buy anything"" my butt) with $1,500 down. Said Expedition needed more repairs than it was worth, or I would have waited and put more down.

At the time, it seemed like the dealership had to go through an ordeal to find me financing. I had missed 3 payments on my now fully paid off credit card in 2018, and the rejection letters made it seem that was part of the reason for my rejections. Eventually, they did find me a loan and I drove away that day.

Thing is, they didn't give me any information about my lender. I remembered the date my first payment was due (October 3) and called the dealership and got the information I needed to then call my lender. I have only gotten the paperwork to register the car in the last few days. (they really dragged their feet...)

I called my lender, and they said I should have gotten a ""welcome letter"" with the information I needed to set up my account and make my first payment, but gave me the information and I made my first car payment early on Sept 27th.

Well, I got a letter from my lender today. It's a rejection letter that is almost a carbon copy I got from every other lender. This is especially odd, considering in the online account from my lender there's a digital PDF copy of the ""welcome letter"" that clearly shows my loan has been accepted.

At the same time, I've been monitoring my credit score through Intuit Mint and Capital One CreditWise. While the 8 hard inquiries(!!?!) from each of the lenders appears, I have yet to see my car loan appear as a credit line on my credit report.

I'm already full of anxiety, since this is the first vehicle I've purchased on a loan. Up till now, I've only bought garbage.

If it turns out that they made a mistake, what will happen? Will I get an opportunity to try to find other financing, or will they just repossess the car? Or will they be forced to abide by the loan agreement as if I had been accepted since I've already started making payments?

Or, should I keep my mouth shut until those missed payments fall off and I can hopefully refinance at a better interest rate and hope they don't notice until then?",finance

They ignore the crimes committed daily by radical Islamists and militants from Pro — Turkish groups of the FSA-arbitrariness, kidnapping, extortion, and political repression.

Damascus has long, for obvious reasons, does not want help from countries that have tried to ignite the war in Syria and supported terrorists. However, the whole of Syria, its citizens living in the government and in the occupied territories, need the lifting of sanctions. This is necessary in order to rebuild the country and ensure peace. However, Western countries together with their allies in the Middle East are trying to support the armed confrontation in Syria, rampant crime in the occupied territories, the development of the shadow sector of the economy — smuggling of hydrocarbon reserves of Syria, drug trafficking, monstrous crimes associated with the illegal trade in human organs, barbaric plunder of historical artifacts and values. The West regularly provides direct and indirect assistance to gangs, while trying to ""crush"" the sanctions liberated from the terrorists of Syria.

At the same time behind the Euphrates, a significant part of the population protests against the actions of the us coalition — local residents are fed up with the actions of the coalition ""Democratic forces of Syria"" (SDF). With the weapons given to them by the Americans, the Kurds, linked to the separatists from the PKK, not only defeated the Islamic state group, but also established a strict regime of occupation throughout this territory. Refusing to cooperate with the local population, the visiting Kurds began to manage through the ""military councils"" of the SDF, supporting the process of exporting Syrian oil.

Trying to suppress Damascus with sanctions, the"" humanitarian-oriented» West does not take into account the fact that tens of thousands of refugees from areas occupied by the coalition of the United States, Turkey or Islamists live in the territories controlled by Damascus. Neither the opinion of Syrian citizens nor the sovereignty of the country, which requires official interaction with Damascus, is taken into account. The US and Turkey are negotiating the creation of a ""security zone"" in the North-East of Syria, not even considering it necessary to give the floor to Damascus — despite the fact that both Ankara and Washington regularly repeat the mantra of ""commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria.""

Wow was there a world to explore. It's absolutely impossible to detail all there is to see, read, hear, and do. In the unexpanded game there are 10 factions where you can climb to the top. You can even join a vampire faction but I usually didn't mess around with vampirism. In the second DLC you can even become a werewolf! 

In the three-way struggle for influence and affluence, you will side with a Great House, the Fighters/Mages/Thieves Guild, and either 1 or 2 additional factions for fun and profit.

The game gives a great sense of scaling power, because at first when your weapon, athletics, acrobatics, magic, and armor skills are low, you won't be able to hit the broad side of a netch. But give it a few levels, really especially level 7-10 or so and you will become essentially invincible. There are also treasures to seek and actual motivation to go spelunking in the many well designed caves, not just for Skyrim's radiant quest reward of 150 gold or whatever, but in Morrowind perhaps a unique artifact to either keep or sell to the museum.

Skyrim seems so *sanitized* and somewhat *dumbed down.* All the doors are quest locked (I **hate** quest locked doors), there are unkillable NPCs (in Morrowind there were ""essential"" NPCs but you could kill them and take the back road to complete the main quest, since the regular main quest is probably broken now), leveled loot which means it sucks no matter what level you are, caves and dungeons that are way too big that you can't even warp out of but they have that backdoor crap which to me is not realistic at all, there are no more attributes so I can't even raise intelligence or strength which means it's not really an RPG. Maybe the RPG element is that you can choose how many radiant quests to do, who to marry, not that it matters, who to pick in the civil war which also doesn't matter, and then just keep going on rails from point A to point B where part of the challenge is trying to stay awake going up that stupid mountain. 

Also fast travel where you click on a map marker is totally bogus. In Morrowind you better have the network learned for silt striders/mage teleporters/boats/propyon indices. And Skyrim found a way to fuck up the prisoner tradition. In Morrowind you are trying to prove yourself as the reincarnation of a fallen hero. And people tell you different answers. It's fucking subtle and interesting. A wise woman of a tribe says you are not the hero but could become him, others tell you that you are him, the hero had a relic that only he could wear and you can wear it, and so on.

personalfinance,I'm an idiot and I racked up an assload of overdraft fees and I need help.,"First of all, please believe, I already know I'm an idiot, and I'll take it as a parenthetical in all replies so you don't have to write it. :P

I'm just going to list this all out as a sequence of events.

0. I'm a student, I have no car and no job, and the bus system closes at 5pm even if I had time for a job. Which I don't, because I'm so drowned in textbooks that I dream in sans-serifs. It's been suggested that I drop out temporarily to resolve the titular problem. I do not consider this an option.

1. I subscribed to some monthly service. I don't even remember what it was. I paid for this service through PayPal, which was connected to my bank account.

2. I forgot about the subscription. I also figured - though I didn't consciously think about it - that if you didn't have money in your bank account, it would just cancel the service you subscribed to. And I didn't have the money in my account. I live on cans of Spaghetti-o's unless my mommy dearest takes pity on me and sics the Pantry Gods on me.

3. I continued to forget about the subscription. 

4. Then I continued to forget about the subscription.

5. After a while, just to be spontaneous, I proceeded to... forget about the subscription.

6. Some months pass. I get exactly one call from the bank, which I don't pick up because I don't recognize the number. I happen to check my email the same day. I rarely ever check my email because it's overflowing in junk no matter how many times I clear it and headbang the ""unsubscribe"" button.

Said email is from the resolutions person at the bank and they ask me when I'm going to be able to add money to the account. I tell them my situation, and that I will be able to put some money into the account in the middle of November, which is when student loan refunds go out.

7. Resolutions Lady sends a reply along the lines of, ""okay, well, your account balance is negative $2,000. Will you be able to pay that in November or?""

8. I shit bricks and die inside. Internally I hear *Hello Darkness, my old friend....* Externally, I ask a very edited and polite version of ""What the fuck what the fuck how the fuck what the fuck.""

9. Resolutions Lady tells me that PayPal kept trying to get money from the bank, but as my dear ol' ma likes to say, ""you can't get blood from a turnip,"" so instead they just kept trying to stab the turnip anyway and the turnip decided it's a kinky bitch.

10. $2,000 in overdraft fees. 

11. I immediately go to PayPal to at least tourniquet the wound and see if they can clear it up. They're like ""lol not our fault brah."" I continue talking with Resolutions Lady. She's like ""lol not our problem brah.""

12. After contemplating whether it would be poetic to put my *Cognitive-Behavior Modification* textbook on the ground and then swan dive off my balcony with the book as my target, I contact the bank and get them to freeze the account. I tell them, it's kind of egregious that the overdraft fees were let to go this far without calling me about it, though I'll acknowledge they occasionally emailed me. I ask them to please please *please* fucking help me.

13. They tell me that they'll halve the amount, and when can I pay them $1000?

14. I'm like ""uh, I still don't get any money until mid-November, can we work out a payment plan?"" (*do you accept firstborn sons? I have no kids and I'm not pregnant but I'm bound to* become *pregnant with how hard y'all are fucking me*)

15. ""welllllll Ms. [Redacted], we'd really prefer a lump sum payment; we can work out a payment plan but it'll really have to be paid in full by mid-December because we can't have your account negative for more than four months""

16. That was yesterday. I'm almost 30 and I called my mom for help because in this situation, *I need my mommy.* She tells me that it's possible for me to tell them to eat some very unappetizing body parts and that they'll eventually close my account and write off the fees. It'll go on my credit, she says, and make it hard for me to get another bank account, but I already got a new bank account like a week ago so that wouldn't be a problem.

17. This idea goes against my morals. However, a counter-argument: food. I search online. The internet backs up what she's saying, but says that it's possible they'll try to collect anyway.

18. I come here. I'm aware that people here are likely to be professionals and advise against what my mother has suggested, and I don't even know if I hope that's wrong. But I need to know if there's anything I can do (or *not* do) because even when my loans come in I really can't afford to just hand over $1000 as a fuck-you-tax (or expensive lesson or whatever).

Can anybody please help me? I know this was wicked long and I'm sorry, but writing things out like this is kind of how I deal.

Before anyone says it: I genuinely don't have time or means to get employed. I tried work-study, but they're full. I'm already donating/selling plasma as a means of having scant groceries because I tend to go all faint and weepy when I'm not fed and watered regularly. My family can't help me more than they already are.

Last note: The sums listed aren't 100% accurate. They're within $500 of the actual sums. 

Thank you for your time and patience.",finance
personalfinance,Your opinion on best new savings account (rates/bonuses/convenience)?,"I have a decent amount of money sitting in a checking account earning 0 interest. I need this money to be liquid so investing it is out of the picture (I have other money in investments). None of my current institutions (such as Schwab), despite some offering great benefits for certain things, offer particularly amazing savings rates. So it looks like I'll need to open a new account somewhere.

The higher yield savings (or money market account) rates at trustworthy banks seems to hover around 1.9-2.2% right now (Ally, Marcus, Synchrony, Amex, Capital One, Discover, HSBC Direct, etc).

I noticed Simple Bank has 2.02%(balances &lt;$10k) to 2.15% (balances &gt;$10k) on their ""Protected Goals"" account, which seems to be a separated checking account that acts for saving purposes but not actually legally defined as a savings account so presumably does not have a 6 transaction limit. Lack of 6 transaction limit doesn't affect me anyway as I will be keeping this money dormant, just desire the liquidity.

The thing making me consider Simple over the other accounts is that they have a bonus of $500 if I deposit $20k+ and keep it in there until the end of January (otherwise $250 if deposit $10k+ or $10k+ remains by the end of January). The downside is that Simple, ironically, doesn't seem so simple. The website is hard to navigate and information, like interest rates or bonuses, is easier found by Googling than navigating their menus. A simple savings account also seems simpler to deal with than these Protected Goals subaccounts.

Bitcoin,Why elites and statists are at war against Bitcoin,"**We are at war**

I know this is going to be a long war: States vs individuals. Statists will fight fiercely to control of the income, activity and ,left unchecked, basically all aspects of the life of individuals. The result of this war is still uncertain but history is on our side.

There are many aspects of this war, but here we focus on the economic part. Nation states took the responsibility of regulating the economic cycle to avoid recessions and in the name of that sacred mission they created narratives that allow them to do almost anything, it worked pretty well for a number of years, but now populist leaders are popping up everywhere and out of control of the elites, it is very hard to curb spending for a populist government so for them it's either debasing/debt or increase taxes.

**Debasing**

It all started with voluntary debt and as the states have money printing machines this seemed a sure bet for people measuring their wealth in fiat. Of course the balance sheet looks different if measured against something like land (fixed) or global GDP (expanding but way less than monetary base).

Debasing/debt is just a way to extract money from the suckers that think they will retire with fiat-related savings and pension funds. Suckers think on their wealth in dollars and think inflation will be under control for the rest of their life. Elites accumulate in assets and consider fiat just a means not an end, Of course they also play the casino game very well so they are OK with Bonds, QE or even MMT. They will sell the part of their wealth still in fiat way before the suckers and their pension funds when/if things start to collapse.

Stocks are a different beast because some of them will survive inflation episodes. Picking the right ones and choosing a good timing to buy seems hard though.

What we are seeing now is that statists are out of control debasing the currencies, the money flows and quickly settles in static low rent pockets and that is why we are not seeing inflation: it is not triggering economic activity anymore as most of it is saved for the future. The existence of negative interest rates bonds is very telling: There is no escape to the fiat system. Real estate is too risky for the reasons I will explain on the tax section.

Crypto, in particular Bitcoin, appears as an option for this lack of freedom. If crypto wins the war the states will not be able to debase their fiat currency anymore as every penny printed will create inflation.

**Income Tax and crypto**

Elites hate taxes on wealth and prefer taxes on income/spending as they are already rich. They lobbied for centuries to design the tax system for their convenience. They still need nation states but they don't want to pay for them. In addition taxing income/spending is way harder than taxing property/assets so the tax code ended up being extremely complex: they have the best lawyers / accountants to find loopholes and pay even less than their share on that.

The statists think they can get away with just taxing income and they are closing all the gaps by creating global entities to control money laundering and tax havens and ultimately they will try to eliminate cash.

Crypto poses a risk to this goal as society will be able to hide complete layers of economic activity from the eyes of the tax collectors. If crypto succeeds and becomes commonplace all the personal services (contractors, gardeners, plumbers, maids, accountants, lawyers) will prefer to be paid in crypto. Corporations will be better off outsourcing work to smaller companies that would be more able to dodge the taxman more efficiently, the trend will continue upwards taking over more and more layers.

Taxing wealth will also be a challenge also as the states will not be able to size the crypto-wealth of individuals or corporations. At least they will be able to size real estate and other assets, and that leads us to:

**The endgame: Georgism and a better planet**

If crypto wins this war, statists will find it hard to fund the nation states services using debasing or taxing income so they will resort to something different, and if you think a little bit, very fair : Tax natural resources.

Natural resources such as land, water, air, minerals, energy, radio frequency permits, shoreline usage, sea/river ports, roads, pollution permits, killing animals permits and I'm sure statists will find others. All these taxes are almost trivial to collect compared to the declarative income tax.

I know they are taxing them now, but now think on really high taxes to support the dwindling income tax.

Of course, corporations will pass these taxes to the consumer so if you drink Coke you will pay for the taxes on land usage of the Coca Cola plant, the water usage, the waste management, and so on. In the end the price structure of all goods and services will reflect the usage of natural resources.

There will be entire categories of things that will become more expensive due to their usage of natural resources that now are ""subsidized"" (cough, cough oil...) . On the other hand all personal services will become cheaper from the consumer point since the service-performers will not pay income tax.

People will not be able to accumulate real state as investment, this will create selling pressure and cheaper land, all land will be used for something.

It will be almost impossible to evade taxes under this schema although the elites will lobby to influence in the tax rates for the different categories. Everybody and their mothers will access tax havens (i.e. crypto wallets)

This scenario gives me hope for the planet",cryptocurrency

We (my wife &amp; I) need a sanity check on a refinancing offer from our friendly local loan officer. He's offering the following:

3.5% interest with 1.5% loan fee + $4K closing costs

Some context:

We're 10 months into a $650,750, 30 year fixed rate 4.99% interest loan (I know, I know, wtf... we live in Seattle). This is the loan calculator we're using to do the maths:

[https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/extra-payments.html](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/extra-payments.html)

After 10 months of our current loan, we've paid $7,981 in principle &amp; $26,912 in interest. We have $1,221,286 in payments left, with $578,518 of that being in interest. Our current payment is $3,489.

Now... we don't have the cash on hand to pay the the loan fee + closing costs, but they can be rolled into the new loan. At first, I ignored my loan officer's emails b/c my instincts tell me that this is not a good idea, but we decided to crunch some numbers and the results have us considering this option.

After rolling the fee &amp; closing costs into the new loan, we would be left with a $656,410, 30 year fixed rate 3.5% interest rate loan. The total payments would come out to $1,061,126, with $404,716 of that being interest. The new payment would be $2,947.

That seems like something we should do, but our instincts are telling me not to. What are we missing?

Just a quick note: we've almost paid off all our other debt and are considering putting in extra monthly mortgage payments, but I figured that was irrelevant to this particular decision. Let us know if that's not the case, though.",finance

personalfinance,Student loan refi/payoff advice request,"Good afternoon, I was hoping someone might be able to give me some advice on my student loan situation. 


When I initially took out my student loans I was entering grad school and utilized all of the available loans offered to me. Graduate school did not work out and I left after 1 year. I finally was able to find a decent job with the government and last year consolidated the loans so that I could enter the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program which I qualify for. My calculated payment was $1,000 a month, I applied for IBR and was approved for a $400/month payment. After a year making payments I received a promotion and a substantial raise in pay. My IBR payments essentially doubled from $400 to a little over $825 a month. I have 108 payments left before I can qualify to receive the loan forgiveness, or $89,100 remaining. 


I have 2 consolidated loans, both at 8%, one for $91,000 and the other for $12,000. Or $103,000 combined. 


The new payment, over the course of the required duration, is almost the cost of the total loan at this moment. If everything stays the same I will only save around $9,000 total, which I understand will become part of my income that year. Additionally the new tax rules don't give any additional benefit for loan repayment. I hit the write-off cap easily with mortgage etc. 


Now. I am fortunate enough to have enough savings that I could pay both loans off entirely. Obviously this represents a significant reduction in overall savings, but would not completely wipe me out. Or I could pay off the $12,000 loan by itself and only have to deal with the $91,000. 


I am also considering refinancing the loans to try and achieve a lower interest rate, but I am not sure how that would effect my ability to utilize the PSLF program. My credit is excellent (around 780). 


Or I could continue as I am and pay the $825 until 2028 and receive the loan forgiveness. 


Can someone please give me some advice about the pros/cons of undertaking any of these avenues? When the payment was $400 it was easy to manage, the $825, while more difficult, is still manageable, but not having it would certainly make things a lot easier.",finance

Verses loans which uses compounding interest formula (amortization) and aren't revolving.

Loans also comes with fees.

Compounding interest + fees= profits for banks.

LOC simple interest and no fees makes LOC easier to pay off.

LOC also builds your credit faster and helps accumulate debt reduction.

Credit cards are also LOC which still have some of the upside (mainly revolving and same grace period) but not as ideal due to fees and interest rates.

personalfinance,Afford a home on 90k/yr,"My wife and I are looking to move into our first home within the next year or so. 
Current monthly income combined after taxes: $5,700

We currently pay:
Rent: $1850 - it doesn't actually get cheaper
Phone: $200 - will be lower soon
Insurance: $200 - will be higher soon
All other bills and debts combined: $1100
Fun/groceries/etc: $500

Everything else is going into a savings for a down payment.

I usually see posts like this and everyone just says no regardless of income. So if your answer is no with nothing more elaborate please save your time. 

The homes we are looking at around in the 350k to 500k. Is it possible or are we dreaming?

----------

**Update based on comments:**

My bi-weekly income is a range of $1600 to $2000 per paycheck. I based the number off the minimum and didn't include a quarterly bonus of 1k after taxes. My wife brings $1250 per paycheck.

My max per month is $2400 for a mortgage. Currently saving just under 2k a month so we'd still be saving a bit above 1k 

I am pretty handy and tend to fix a lot of stuff myself. Grew up in an old shack that needed constant repairs we couldn't afford. Also I'm friends with a lot of the construction crew and being the IT guy I can easily trade my skills for someone else's skills when its above my ability to repair. 

I can get a discount on the homes my company builds. 5% off the market value of the house which is what it'd be sold to me for. 50% off closing costs, waived HOA fees, special interest rates and only a 3% down payment.

**Update based on time:**

Since I originally posted this some things have changed. I got a nice little pay raise so our combined monthly income is $6100. I am expecting a larger pay raise in October of 2020.

 We signed a lease that is slightly shorter but also cheaper. 

The wife is on the verge of getting a new job that pays around what I was making at the start of this job. If she does get that our monthly income will go up to around $7300 if I get the raise I am anticipating as well it should be around $7600. 

Our target price point hasn't changed. We don't care necessarily about the final price its the price point per month that we ultimately care about. $2300/month

I've spoken with our Mortgage team manager and our range of $350-500k with the company we should be able to get in our monthly payment target around 430k and the area we are looking with $0 down.",finance

btc,Saifedean Ammous: BTC is just for inter-bank settlement,"Just got done watching this debate: [https://youtu.be/MN4klUUx8fM?t=2846](https://youtu.be/MN4klUUx8fM?t=2846)

In particular, I noted the clip from 47:26 - 49:43

Several times over the course of the dialog, Ammous takes the position that the fundamental future for BTC is *not* to be used directly for payments, but only to settle accounts *in bulk* between larger financial institutions (presumably banks).

His idea is that you would use some consumer-grade payment system (e.g. a credit card, Venmo, whatever) to pay at the grocery store, and then maybe once-per-day, the shoppers' banks would do a single BTC transfer (with a gigantic tx fee) to the grocery store's bank, containing the aggregated amounts of all those pending payments.  At that point, BTC becomes an implementation detail for the IT departments at the banks to worry about, and virtually no one has a non-custodial wallet or transacts peer-to-peer.

It's mind-blowing to me that someone whose vision for Bitcoin involves everyone being forced to transact through custodial wallets is taken so seriously by professing libertarians.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,What would you do with 200k inheritance?,"Throwaway.

Tl;dr. What would you do if you inherited 200k? 

I am currently abroad on a 2 year working holiday. I have inherited 200k AUD.

I have about 10 months left of my working holiday, and around $14k to see me through to the end of my trip, which is fine so I won’t need to touch any of the inheritance before I get home. 

When I left Australia, I sold everything I owned including my car. I’m going home to basically a couch, mattress and my personal items. When I first get home before I get a job (where I expect to make roughly 100-120k pa before taxes), I will live between my parents houses. 

I have my 200k earning me 4%, so I should go home to roughly 215k. I plan on spending 25k-ish on a car, in Australia cars are pretty expensive so it’ll get me a non-fancy, reliable car. 

Now, the rest of it. I want to buy a home and I want to live alone. I am 30 and have flat shared my entire adult life and I literally cannot do it anymore. My reservation with buying a place comes from two places:

1. If I lose my job for any reason (impending recession), I don’t have a partner to help with payments. Important to note, if I ever got into serious trouble my parents are in a position to help, but not long term. 

2. I don’t know if the next city I live in will be where I end up.

Also important to note: I have some hefty student loans which I am not inclined to pay off with the money because the interest rate is lower than what I earn with the money banked. These total about 35k. 

I plan on speaking to a financial adviser but was just curious on what you would do with it. Would you just invest it until you are 100% ready to buy, or would you bite the bullet and buy now? I’d be looking at a 300k mortgage on top of the 200k deposit.

personalfinance,"Is AU$750 a month in savings good after expenses, tax and mortgage repayments?","My partner and I are currently trying to determine a comfortable amount to borrow to purchase a house in Sydney. Current interest rates are at 3.3%, however, we want to pay it off sooner/build contingency so we will pay it as if it's 7%.

After looking at our current salaries and comfortable expenses our 7% interest rate will leave us with AU$750 per month. This scenario will also hopefully sustain us when interest rates go up, we have kids in the future and unexpected expenses arise.

At 3.3% interest rate our mortgage repayments will be a little over 40% of our income. But we both are around 30 and anticipate future payrises.

The question is, is AU$750 in savings per month sustainable? Or are we being too ambitious and should look at buying a cheaper place?

investing,More than Half of All Stock Buybacks are Now Financed by Debt. Here’s Why That’s a Problem,"https://fortune.com/2019/08/20/stock-buybacks-debt-financed/

The era of cheap borrowing is fostering corporate America’s favorite investor-pleasing activity: Share buybacks.

Indeed, more than half of all buybacks are now funded by debt. And while there's an argument that repurchases benefit share prices and investors, at least in the short run, it's questionable whether highly indebted companies should be doing this. Sort of like mortaging your house to the hilt, then using it to throw a lavish party.

But once a recession inevitably arrives, the result may not be pretty for companies with lots of leverage, in no small part due to buybacks. With corporate debt now higher than its peak in scary late-2008, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan has warned, overly leveraged companies ""could amplify the severity of a recession.""",finance
personalfinance,Refinance my 5/5 Arm or stay put?,"I’m not exactly sure if I should move forward on this refinance, and can’t find a calculator to help decide since it’s based on an adjusting arm. 

Current loan:
5/5 ARM
4.25%

Purchase price: 349,000
Left on loan: ~333,0000 
Home value estimate: ~$365,000-380,000
Purchase date: Dec 2016
Adjust date: Jan 2021
Escrow account: $8k
Taxes: 8k per year
Insurance: 1.5k

New loan offer:

3.875%
Loan amount: 349,000
Assumes appraisal of $365,000-380

Any wisdom appreciated! Hopefully I’ve got all the info that’s needed...

EDIT: The extra 16k for the loan breaks down as such:
3k - Loan payoff: ($336,000 is their loan payoff amount I don't know why they assume 3k extra for paying off the current loan? Maybe I input it correctly or that will adjust when they check)
8k - Escrow (I knew this much)
3k - Origination fees 
2k - Service fees (google says 4k-8k is normal in fees for a refinance?)

...I've spent about 3k USD on it (I'm talking to a therapist.  I emotional gamble/spend).  I'm deleting the app once my last prize shipment goes out.

I did some sleuthing on how much I could get back if I sold my winnings (figures, stuffed animals, etc.) and could realistically get about $500.

When taxes roll around, how do I report this stuff?  Everything I could find on virtual currency was on Bitcoin, and not app specific currency.  Do I pay state tax since it's in Japan?  Do the things I sell need state taxed, even if it's technically a gambling loss?  Do I report the winnings if they are objects, since I didn't win money?  I'm in Ohio.

Bitcoin,"How I LOST a lot of money with Bitcoin, and why I don't give a fuck.","#I Buy Bitcoin

There, now you know, I own a Bitcoin (or more) and I buy them fucking coins.

Recently I had an investor come to me with big monster dollars; he says buy me dem fucking coins. I wait for the right time to buy, and boom it's $13k...

Long story short, my investor is down 20%. Does he give a fuck? Nope! Why? Cause he ain't cashing out!

He's got time, and I got confidence dem coins be going back to $11k... **and probably more!**

4 YEARS - 4 years is the life-cycle of a Bitcoin.

In 4 years, Bitcoins *should* be expected to double. *Merely* doubling every 4 years is 19% returns (annualized)... HOLLARAGE!

If Bitcoins go to $22k... *in the next 4 years...* my investor is psyched. If it hits $88k in... 12 years... that's still awesome.

Even with only 20% of his portfolio devoted to Bitcoins, Bitcoins might out earn the other 80%... with far, far less work, effort, and taxes - just buying and holding for multiple years.

And that is *even if* it only hits $88k *IN TWELVE YEARS*. That's 19% ROI (BTC) vs 8% ROI (SPY).

---

Now that man is old. He don't need no money.

But what 'bout me? I got bills homes.

Now here is deh trick.

ARE YOU EARNING YOUR MAXIMUM?

Probably, for *reasons*, you ain't.

What's that mean? It means you are losing - LOSING - money each year you work, below the better wage.

Bitcoin ain't my meal ticket... that's work. Bitcoin is my lifelong security ticket.

But Bitcoin gives me something other investments don't, *POSSIBILITY*. The *possibility* to get to quit work and retire, instantly.

Now what do you do with new found knowledge? Well first you focus on making that fooking dollar. Make so much dollar, working almost seems fun. What does it take to make that? A new mindset. Checkout a business book, visit professional clubs, make that fucking money.

You got to get smart.

Focus on no less than $200k per annum for self-employed, or $100k if W2 with full benefits - accept absolutely no less.

Are you making $30k / year? Invest in skill training, equipment. For $10k you can nab a computer programming career in a year paying $60k.

That's 300% return on investment, do it. Fully capitalized (profit x 5), that's $150k expected from a $10k investment... *CLAP HANDS* DO IT.

If ya got to work for fucking money, make it *easy*. Make it reward. Get smart, so the money gets easy. Get them rewards, so that you enjoy that work.

HOW LONG HAVE YOU SUFFERED AT LOW PAY? How long did you allow yourself to 'slave' without any chance of success or thriving!

NO MORE!

---

I committed myself to *smart* work, making *good dollar* some 2 years ago.

But still Bitcoin boomed... so what did I do? Did I buy a lambo? Did I quit?

Fuck all, no!

BOOM - Now my salary demands doubled - doubled mother fucker.

In 2 years I go from $80k to $200k (annualized, self-employed).

But do I *actually* make that $200k? No.

More like I went from $80k to $80k... but from 30 hours to 10 hours of laboring, per week.

The thing is, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY JOB!

You'd be surprised, but getting paid $200 / hour makes you love god-damn about anything, honestly.

Even if Bitcoin booms, would I retire? Fuck no. WHY THE FUCK WOULD I? I GET PAID FUCKING AMAZING!

And what if Bitcoin goes slow, or in the tubes? WHO GIVES A FUCK! I making money hand over fist, and got the career path to earn butt loads more.

I might spend 10 hours per week now *branding* or *networking* to make the next mark... but laboring a mere 2 hours more per week might double my savings... that's huge!

And what am I going to do if Bitcoin goes bust?

TAKE ANOTHER STAB MOTHER FUCKER!

I got Tesla in my sights, I had Lambda School on the radar from day 1.

TAKE A STAB!

If you lose out, you keep working... GREAT! I got to do that EVEN IF I WIN with the STOCK MARKET!

But if you take a chance on an early investment stage startup, you can get 100% annualized returns.

It only takes a few of these to hit, and boom, you are fucking a loaded god.

But I got **money** security because I have **skills** security.

I got the skills to make the fucking money.

What I need is WEALTH, not money.

For my buck, Bitcoin is the best wealth making investment at this point in time, available to a general public.

Bitcoin is also the best store of wealth, cause it's mobile, and I am mobile.. I can't get cornered at the ATM by Uncle Sam nor can I get trapped having to liquidate and rotate around a series of real-estate and stock holdings, should I want to move to Puerto Rico, or whatnot.

And *inflation risk* is less concerning, with Bitcoin... and the *passive price inflation* is expected to be 19%, at a mere doubling every 4 years. That is HUGGGEEE!

In fact, I've taken out (don't hate me) loans at good interest rates and long payoffs, to buy them fucking coins.

&gt; While it sounds crazy, students absolutely should be buying long-term, huge-payoff investments (like Bitcoin) - financially speaking

But that is aside the point. **The point is:**

If you are worried about a dip - EARN MORE MONEY!

If you are want wealth - GO LONG! 4 YEARS AT LEAST!

If you want a lambo - YOU ARE A MORON! - and -

If you want to retire - GET PAID MORE TODAY!

---

And beyond that, just be realistic. 8% returns is about the SPY average, but say even 11% is a reasonably well-managed index - still, that is miles below 19% for Bitcoin.

Now how does BTC get to 19%? By maintaining consistent demand, and consistent cash-out-cash-in rates of investment.

Not consistent PERCENTAGES, but consistent DOLLARS.

In effect, for Bitcoin to fail to achieve 19% (over 4 years), barring an unusual event (like Satoshi liquidating), then the amount of DOLLARS on the planet must never increase (technology stops, population flatlines) OR Bitcoin has *already* reached peak popularity, and significantly so.

So that's the question to you...

Has an investment that predictably returns 19% reached peak popularity and widespread public adoption? An investment unseizable, totally movable, and completely passive? Transferable worldwide in an instant?

I think not. I say we got ROOOOOOMMM to grow.

And that is why I don't give a fuck about losing money - I'm not about to take it out in cash.

And that is why I don't give a fuck about selling Bitcoins - I'm only selling to EARN way more money in job skills, which goes back to Bitcoin.

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing Help,"Hi everyone, need some advice on these crippling loans.  


I currently have several federal loans that add up to $225K.

Two of those loans ($31K and $19K) are at 7.65% APR. I’m looking into refinancing those two federal loans through First Republic, who are offering me a 1.90% APR if I get approved.  
Not sure if I should refinance one or both of those loans. For both, I’d have to cut down on my savings almost completely, but it’d mean I’d possibly lower my federal loans monthly payments of $441 (is that how it works?), and payoff the high interest loans in 5 years (hopefully less if I’m able to incur additional income).  
What would be the financially wise way to go about this?",finance

personalfinance,Personal loan for a cheaper car,"I have a car loan for a new car that i regret buying. I have been paying for 36 months and have 39 months left. Its a 16% interest rate. 

I bought this car a while ago and have since learned from my mistakes and have grown my credit from a 550 to a 710 on Credit karma.

My buddy got a job and has a work vehicle and doesnt want his old car anymore ao he is talking about selling it to me, it will be around 4-5 grand. Im upside down on my car 4500-5500. So, simply taking a new loan on his car and eating my negative equity is not possible the loan to value is way to high. Its a 13 or 14 mazda with about 40k miles. As you can see he really doesnt drive it, has a hit and run dent in rhe front, and he is a good friend the car is in good shape and i have driven it and looked over it. Im not worried about it mechanically. The dent doesnt bother me either as i would plan to drive this car till it dies.

So my plan is to go to my credit union (been there 5ish years) and apply for a personal loan through them and buying my friends car and selling my car to the dealership i work at.

Is this a sound idea? My intrest will surley be lower, even if buy just a few percent. I know personal loans can be higher. I owe about 17500 on my car so my total loan value will be lower and the interest i would pay on the new loan will be less than what i still have to pay for my current loan. My payment is curently 503, so it would obviously go down as well so I would plan to pay around 100 over the payment every month to save even more off of the interest.

Im also worried about insurance. Hopefully my insurance company could provide gap insurance? But im uncertain because it would be a personal loan rather than a car loan.

Is this a good idea? Or am I looking at this wrong. I would be looking to take out a personal loan for the mazda and the money left over on my current loan. So 8-9k

personalfinance,Student loans with pregnant wife,"My wife and I have been working to pay off a very large student loan balance. Currently paying $5,000 per month on a 5 year loan with minimum payment of $2,985. We just found out we're expecting again, after draining our entire HSA last year on a pregnancy that ended in an expensive out-of-state termination due to fetal defects incompatible with life. So, we're cautiously optimistic (and also enrolled for maximum HSA contributions again next year). We currently have a $25,000 emergency fund, low mortgage ($1200/mo), two paid off but high-mileage vehicles (both &gt;120K), and no other debt besides the outrageous student loan. We budget our dual incomes very carefully and I don't think we'll have any issues paying for child care and all of the expenses associated with a child, but my paternal instinct to save is running on overdrive. I'm considering paying the minimum on the student loan and keeping the difference ($2015/mo) in our high-yield savings with the emergency fund. The advantage is, if some emergency happens, we can easily manage it with our by-then very large emergency fund. The drawback is, I'm taking funds away from paying a 3.45% interest rate loan and putting them in a 2%ish savings account. I estimate a pretty low impact of the 1.45% difference, about $400 through the end of 2020, which seems to me to be worth the peace of mind. Just wondering if that's a rational plan?",finance

It should cover 77% of my power needs  with current usage.  Pennsylvania has SRECs for a bit of extra money over the year, and Philly itself has a $.20/watt rebate I can take advantage of next year (even though the install would start this year)  Completion of the install would be 3 months from now but they said they'd at least get it started before the end of the year to allow the 30% federal rebate to be claimable.

personalfinance,Are Pensions Worth It?,"I read the post with the article regarding GE freezing their pension plan and someone commented that if you have a pension, you are lucky. My employer has a pension plan, and I don’t feel lucky.

I’ve gotten to the point where I low-key hate working for the government and I want to move on from my current job. However, my pension doesn’t vest for another year. I did some math to evaluate if it is worth it to stay for my pension to vest. When I’ve run the numbers, it does not seem worth it to stay long enough for the pension to vest.

The pension pays out at retirement age based on a formula. It the average salary of the three years you earned the most, multiplied by the number of years worked, multiplied by a sliding scale: 1% at age 52, 2% at 62, or 2.5% at age 67.

I’m 31 and make about $80k annually. At this point I’ve contributed over $24k to the pension from my own contributions. Over 9% of each of my paychecks goes towards my pension (pre-tax).

If I invested this lump sum right now it would be worth about $80k when I turn 52 or $192k when I hit 67, assuming 6% annual interest rate. Assuming a 4% “safe withdrawal rate” I could use about $3,200 of the money annually starting at age 52 or about $7,680 annually from age 67. These numbers are obviously higher with higher interest, 6% is pretty conservative.

Assuming I tough it out for another year to vest my pension, I would have worked for 5 years, and would receive a payout of about $3,766 annually starting at age 52 or $9,416 annually from age 67. This is a worse payout than if I took the $32K lump sum I will have contributed and invested it for the next 20 or 35 years! (Assuming only 6% interest)

Am I missing something? Everyone I talk to says I should tough it out in a sucky job until my pension is vested. The way I see it, the only benefit to the pension is to hedge my bets. I max out my HSA, my 457, and my Roth IRA each year. Having the pension allows me to diversify, but the numbers don’t seem all that favorable.",finance

personalfinance,10k to pay off debt. Where should it go?,"I will have about 10k to allocate to debt payoff in the coming weeks. MY question is where should I focus the money. My 2 focuses are on my car loan and student loans. My wife and I have a combined roughly 50k in student loans. My car note is about 11k. We start paying on the student loans in December. If i put the 10k towards the student loans I can knock off around $150 dollars worth of the $550 payment the loans will require. Should I put the money towards the car I could probably pay it off around December which would save me $350 a month. I pay $350 a month on it now, although the minimum is only $250. Also to be noted is that no matter the path that I choose, I will still be making double payments on the student loans when the time comes to get it paid down quicker as well. 

I know the car sounds more logical as it will allow me to have more free money to allocate other places, but paying down 1/5 of a large student debt bill would feel so relieving. Especially knowing that my wife will be returning to school next year and adding some to that. The average interest rate of the student loans is very close the interest rate of the vehicle. I would say in total that 50K is spread out across 14 different (Sub-loans) of various sizes that are all grouped and held by the same company respectively for my wife and I. 

This seems all over the place at this point but any input would be greatly appreciated.

investing,Do Not leave cash sitting in your Schwab brokerage account,"I understand that businesses need to make money, but I think that all the cards should be on the table as far as one of the biggest trade-offs investors are making in return for getting commission free trading with Schwab. People who trade stocks often might buy stocks more now that trading is free, but they also might sell them more, therefore leaving funds sitting in cash for a longer amount of time. Fidelity, which has yet to jump on the commission free bandwagon offers money market mutual funds as sweep accounts, so your uninvested cash will earn 1.6%-1.8% (as of October 2019) while it is sitting on the cash sweep account. Schwab on the other hand does not offer money market sweep accounts and rather you get a paltry 0.12% yielding FDIC insured sweep account. Do a quick google search and you will see how many people are [hoarding cash](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-08/world-s-rich-put-a-third-of-funds-into-cash-as-trade-war-simmers) and it starts to make sense how Interest Revenue is one of Schwab's biggest revenue drivers and therefore part of the reason they are able to offer commission free trades.

Rather than let your money sit in cash, move it into Schwab's prime or federal money market funds (SWVXX or SNVXX), or ultra short-term ETFs (i.e., [""cash management ETFs""](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/bb06dn/basic_cash_management_etfs/)) like BIL, ICSH, or JPST. Schwab's money market funds actually pay a similar or slightly higher yield than the comparable Fidelity mutual fund at the moment. Vanguard still wins in this department though by offering the highest yielding money market funds which can also serve as sweep accounts.

I don't keep much cash in my checking account and none in my brokerage accounts and rather I use the ETF ICSH (2.3% SEC yield as of October 2019) as my short to intermediate term savings account. If you need to sell one of these ETFs or a money market fund to buy stocks, you will have to watch out for timing and free riding rules, but it shouldn't be a huge problem.

Sorry if this has already been brought up....I understand this won't affect many people who constantly stay invested, and even still, it only has a small effect on your portfolio, but I figured I'd make a post about it just in case.  I also don't mean to bash Schwab...but you have to acknowledge that they are knowingly and needlessly adding a step between your sweep account and a higher yielding money market fund for the purpose of higher revenue. Yes, ultimately it falls on the individual to handle their investments as needed, but there's no way Schwab is really doing what's in the best interest of it's customers even though they are being praised for ""democratized investing"" for their move to commission free trading. Fidelity has a [history of paying high interest on it's sweep accounts](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fidelity-sweep-accounts-cash-rates-federal-reserve-schwab-merrill-lynch-vanguard-etrade-51565291732) and they have constantly been mentioning it's higher yielding default money market sweep accounts but I'm afraid it's falling on deaf ears...doesn't really have the same ring as ""commission free stock trading"".

**TLDR**; Schwab is making money on you by pocketing the spread between the rate on brokerage sweep accounts and market rates as part of a trade-off for commission free trading. This amounts to about $160/yr in lost interest for every $10,000 you leave sitting in cash. Move your cash into a money market fund or cash management ETF instead.

My car is a Subaru Crosstrek Limited 2018 (Moonroof package w/navigation &amp; Harman Kardon speakers Option #23) and I financed the car through Chase with an interest rate of 5.09%, 72 month term. This was my first vehicle so I didn't know much about financing. Today when doing my car maintenance an advisor wanted to talked to me about buying my car since they needed used cars for their lot and my car was the perfect candidate. My currant car has about 11k miles on it and is about 2 years now.
They offered to buy my car for $22k and if I were to get a 2019 model they would give me a discount on it. Currently I owe on my loan about $26k left out of the $35k with $2000 down. ($37k total) I pay about $577 a month ($453) principal ($125) Interest. 
Now on the loan they said they can get me a lower interest rate of 3.49% and probably lower with the special offer they have now with 2.9%, 72 month term.
With the numbers they gave me if I were to get everything the same as my 2018 crosstrek limited the Vehicle was quoted for $31,725 and with the discount they are giving me it will be $29,702.
Doing the math I would end up owing with taxes $33,523 (including the previous loan amount $37,523)

Now at then end If I would get everything thing the same as my 2018 I would end up just going back too square #1 with my loan. However I would this time get a lower interest rate with the adds of new car benefits ( 3 year warranty, 2 years free maintenance service etc.) I'm not sure if this is a good deal or not due to the fact the 2019 doesn't have that many changes from the 2018 model. The only thing that is getting me interested on this deal is the lower interest rate at which point I'm not sure if it's better to just refinance. On that note I am also refinance my house next year as well so I'm not sure how it would hit my credit score which is on the high 700's. Any advice would be really appreciated.

**Update:** Thank you all for the insight and advice! Knowing now I'll stick with my 2018 crosstrek and refinance my car next year after I've refinance my house.",finance

I'm leaning more towards just staying with Vet United and taking their IRRRL offer; less hassle, not that different in payment (seems to only be 10ish bucks?), I still plan on overpaying by keeping what I'm paying the same to gain more equity quicker (still active duty, so while rare in my shop, orders are always a possibility).

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

financialindependence,"Update: Five Years Down, Five To Go: My half-way to FI/RE!","Hey everyone!  It recently occurred to me that my first post about my FI/RE plan was just over five years ago.  I really haven't posted an in-depth update since then (though I've posted charts and graphs occasionally, but never a full-depth review).  

[Original Post, 5 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/2h257a/15year_fi_plan_opinions/?st=k1gpxyq0&amp;sh=19e631d2)

My FI/RE number and dates jump around a lot, but most of them agree that 2024, give or take a year, is about when I'll be ready for retirement.  That means that if I've been seriously saving for five years, and I have five more to go, that I'm chronologically half-way to FI/RE.  That's certainly variable - closer to my FI/RE date, I may decide I want to stick it out a little longer to increase my expenses in retirement.  Of course, a market crash between now and then could also impact my timeframe.  However, I'm a person of principle, so I'm just going to stay the course.  

Regarding my situation:  A lot's changed in five years, but a lot has stayed the same, too.  My SO and I are now married, we bought the house we'd been thinking about.  We still want to FI/RE as soon as possible, but our expenses have increased a decent amount in the meantime.  This is largely due to two factors:  Basic lifestyle inflation, and an emphasis on gifting (we're, by a large margin, the most financially fortunate of our friends.  Thus, we treat our friends to dinner/drinks and pay more than our share on group vacations and trips quite often).  Fortunately, our income has grown faster than our expenses have.

**Income**  
The income numbers provided are inclusive of salary + bonus for my spouse and I combined.  Additionally, my spouse has a second job which pays a very high hourly rate for a few hours of work per week, and I receive some of my pay in equity (stock from the company I work for), but because these factors are quite variable (don't provide the same income every week/month), I do not include them in my income number above.  This means our real income is actually a decent bit higher than what I show above - what's shown there is a lower bound.  

**EDIT:**  Some folks have asked about the math here.  I did some extra math, and our variable income has averaged about $70k the past four years.  As described above, I don't typically include this value when doing my math (because of its variability), but folks pointed out that my increases in net worth didn't add up if the number wasn't provided.  To correct that, the number is now provided.  

My income has increased considerably in the past five years, and makes up the majority of our combined household income.  (I am a software engineer, spouse is a teacher)  However, I feel that I'm reaching a plateau in my field - further raises are contingent upon promotions, which are contingent upon performing better than I believe I am capable of.  I think it is thus likely reasonable to assume my income will remain nearly flat for the next five years.  thisisfine.png

My spouse has been kicking around the idea of quitting their teaching job and working their second job more hours.  Their second job pays much better per hour, but is far more variable in availability.  It's possible they would have no work for months at a time, or it's possible they'd end up with more work than they could do.  Their income is only a small (~20%) chunk of our total combined income, so it would certainly be possible to absorb this sort of decrease, if this is what ends up happening.  

**Expenses**  
In the past five years, my spouse and I have purchased a new house ($335k, on a 30 year mortgage @ 3.625%) and increased our ""fun budget/gifting"" spending considerably.  Our expenses have migrated upwards, but feel like they've settled in reasonably at about $66,000 per year.  When we originally talked about this new home, we thought this would be our ""forever home"", but the longer we live here, the more we feel like this isn't the case.  This home will likely be our working home, but post-FI we may end up moving elsewhere (not exactly downsizing, but just not being exactly where we're at).  The goal with that move would be to put ourselves a little further away from the city on a little bit more land.  More about that below.  

If you look at the expenses graph provided, you'll see some large spikes in 2017 and 2018.  These correspond to large individual purchases (paying for a wedding, honeymoon, new furniture for our house, and tricking out my gaming lounge).  Because of the spikes, our expenses reached a high of $88,000 in 2017.  However, we're on track for total expenses of only $62,000 in 2019, so I think assuming about $66,000 is reasonable going forward.  In my flair, I reference ""ChubbyFi"", which I would equate to approximately an $80,000 annual spend/$2.4M target.  I don't actually treat this as my target, though I may change my tune as the date approaches.  

**FI Savings**  
The vast majority of our growth has been from new investments.  Between my spouse and I, we contribute nearly $100,000 each year to tax-advantaged accounts, and an extra $50-60k to taxable ones.  Unfortunately, the awesome growth of 2016-2017 mostly missed us (our accounts were too small still).  

We max out all of our tax-advantaged accounts (401k, 403b, Mega backdoor, both regular backdoors) and do tax loss harvesting in taxable accounts. We're using pretty standard three-fund portfolios, with relatively basic allocations, rebalanced occasionally.  Nothing exciting or special here.  

**Our Plan**  
Stay the course!  We've built the life we want, and we're saving for it.  As the years go on, we've already shifted our target once, so it's possible it may shift again.  If that happens, well that's fine.  I'd originally planned on retiring before 2030, and that's still my plan - in fact, I've moved the date up quite a bit, so if it moves back a bit too, that's fine.  As the date gets closer, it'll get more well-defined.  

There's two large variables at play here, and that's my spouse's work arrangement and my dream of buying land for a homestead/commune.  Each of these could impact our plans and numbers somewhat substantially (but likely no more than 20% in any one direction, so no major shifts, just some pull-in/push-out).  I've always wanted to be a little closer to nature, and having the land to start an orchard/apiary/vineyard/hop farm would be my dream come true - I'd spend my days growing, brewing and making all manner of beverages (gardening and homebrewing are hobbies of mine now - I'd love to scale them up).  A handful of my friends have suggested this is their dream as well, so we've discussed the possibility of this being a communal getaway/living arrangement.  This whole idea is still quite ethereal, however.  I don't have the time/energy at the end of the work day to implement this just yet, my work takes too much out of me.  

**Post-FI**  
I'm going to talk about withdrawal strategy for a bit.  This isn't particularly exciting either, but this is something that every FI plan needs.  Each year, we plan to convert the standard deduction's worth of traditional funds to Roth (we already have quite a lot of Roth principal - this is just a tax avoidance strategy), and withdraw entirely from our taxable accounts to pay our expenses until those accounts are depleted.  By my math, our LTCG should be low enough that we can even tax gain harvest and still remain in the 0% LTCG bracket and pay no federal taxes at all.  Our state and local taxes should be minimal (near-zero).  If our taxable accounts are depleted before age 60, we can withdraw Roth principal (which we should have plenty of).  Past 60, we can withdraw from Traditional and Roth simultaneously.  

I've not really talked about healthcare.  Because it's such a huge variable (5-10 years from now it could either be free or *incredibly* expensive), I've chosen to ignore it.  There's nothing I can do about it right now, so I'm going to wait until closer to retirement before worrying about it.  If it turns out that the current trend (dismantling of the ACA and increasing of costs for non-working people) continues, this will of course delay my FI plans.  So be it.  I'll deal with it when I need to.

personalfinance,Should I save up to buy a house or pay off debt first? (US),"So I am a 26 year old guy making $80,000 a year. I have an estimated $38,500 in mixed student loans with varying interest rates, and around $16,000 left on my car with an interest rate around 5.5%. Putting my total debt around $54,500. 

Now I only have $8000 in a high yield savings account and $5,500 in my checking account. If I were to buy a house, it would probably be around the $300K price range. I would like to put at least 10% as a down payment on a house, so around $30,000. Obviously I would want to save more than that so I don't drain my checking account for that down payment. My credit score is around 800 and I already spoke with a realtor and got a great mortgage rate. 

So my question is: Should I be saving my extra income towards the down payment of a house? Or towards paying off my debt as quickly as possible?

Total *expenses*: I am making **$4712** monthly. 

My total monthly *expenditures* are around **$2248** which include rent, car payment, student loan payment, cable, and any other routine monthly expense. 

Leaving me with **$2464** *extra income each month* to spend on gas, groceries, entertainment, ect*.* This is where most of my spending occurs. I put all of these expenses on my credit cards and pay them off each billing cycle for the rewards and never carry a balance over to the next month. Of that, I only put $600 monthly into that high yield savings account.

If I were to buy a house, I would definitely get a roommate or two to help pay that off as fast as I could.

personalfinance,Best use of savings?,"Not sure if this is the right place to post. I have a pretty basic understanding of personal finance and thought I'd see if someone could share some helpful insights to get me thinking more creatively.    



I'm 31 years old, my take-home pay is about $5,200 per month. I pay about $1,100 in student loan payments per month. My rent is $500. No kids/dependents except dogs that sometimes need expensive vet appointments.   I have health insurance through my job.    



I've saved about $30,000 over the past two years. I have a private student loan with a balance of $32,000 at a 6.125% interest rate. I have a number of federal loans that have been aggregated into two bundles: one $40,000 loan with an average interest rate of 5.67%, and one $74,000 loan with an average interest rate of 5.82%. I'm currently paying about $1 of principal for every $3 of interest comprising each monthly payment.    



My primary goal is to save up and purchase a house. That is why I haven't moved to a more aggressive payment plan yet that would allow me to waste less on interest payments. I hope to save $40,000 - $45,000 and buy a home in the $300,000 range this spring.     

&amp;#x200B;

Just curious if anyone has any advice based on the above for how I could be more efficiently using the money I do have. Based on those interest rates, should I be taking the ""consolidate your student loan"" mailers more seriously? Should I take a private loan to pay off existing student loans? Generally just curious if I seem way off the mark or like I'm missing opportunities to make more out of my money.

gaming,"Need help remembering an old, monochrome PC Game","Hey, y'all.  This has been bugging me for days for some reason.  When I was in elementary school back in the mid 90s, there was an ""educational game"" of some kind that ran on a computer.  Here's what I can remember:    
 - I don't know if the game was monochrome or the computer was, but the game was black and orange, no other colors    
 - You played as a kid in a spy getup: fedora, trench coat, sunglasses    
 - You were tasked with taking pictures of whatever the enemy in the game was.  That was how you defeated them.  You picked up rolls of film as your ""ammo"".

personalfinance,What's the diff between ROTH and After-Tax?,"We just got our raises at work.  I went into my Fidelity account to increase my 401k contributions accordingly when I noticed an option I have never seen before: After-Tax.

I read over the definitions of both ROTH and After-Tax, and I hate to say this, but I just can't understand what the difference is between the two.  They honestly sound like the same thing to me.  

I realize that this is probably a dense question.... But could someone ELI5 the difference between ROTH and After-Tax when it comes to 401k contributions?


*What the site said regarding the two:*

ROTH
Designated Roth contributions are elective deferrals for which you irrevocably elect special tax treatment. You will pay federal income taxes and, in most cases, state income taxes on the amount that you elect to contribute to the plan, up to the annual maximum IRS dollar limit. At the time of distribution, you may withdraw your contributions and any earnings on this money tax-free, as long as certain withdrawal criteria have been met. Your company may match all or a portion of these contributions.

AFTER-TAX
The amount you can contribute to a retirement savings plan, using a portion of your salary that has already been included in your taxable income. Income taxes have already been calculated on the amount contributed. However, any earnings on these contributions can grow tax-deferred. Income taxes are not due on any earnings until they are withdrawn from the plan.  Your company may match all or a portion of your after-tax contributions in order to provide them with the most flexibility regarding taxes. (It may be advantageous for some people to pay taxes on the contributions now, because they would be in a higher tax bracket during retirement).",finance

Hi there, so this is my first reddit post, so please bear with me. I just turned 28 and this past year I have put a lot of focus on saving for my future, so I am trying to figure out if I should pay off my car loan or contribute more to my 401K.

I know that traditional knowledge says to pay of the debt first, but my thought is that I am financially in a pretty good position -- I have about $8,000 in cash and have contributed $8,000 to my 401K plan so far this year. I also have $2500 in a Roth IRA. I currently owe $14,000 on my car and would like to get it paid off ASAP, but I have been thinking about switching my 401K contribution to 100% through the end of the year to get as much money in there as possible before 2020.

Part of the reason I am considering this is because I recently got a raise from $50,000 to $80,000 so I know that I will easily be able to pay off the car over the next year. With the $8,000 I have in cash I'll be able to get by without any pay check for the remainder of the year. My thinking is that for the next two and a half months I should contribute as much to my 401K as possible right now so that the money goes to work for me over the next 37-ish years.

Does it make sense to try to get money into my 401K as fast as possible or should I just pay of the car and move on from there?

Once again, I know this goes against the traditional advice of paying of debt first then investing in your future, but wanted to see what everyone here thinks.

financialindependence,"Why Michael Burry’s ""index fund bubble"" prediction doesn’t matter","Michael Burry is the guy who famously predicted the real estate collapse in 2007 and was depicted in the movie “The Big Short”. He’s recently come out predicting a new bubble that’s about to pop: Index funds. I know many or most in the FI/RE community are big into index funds. So we should be worried, right? I don't think so. Here's why.

###Got it right once syndrome

The media LOVES to overweight the opinion of the person who famously called the last market crash correctly. This is amplified even further by the fact that Burry was played by Hollywood hunk Christian Bale in a blockbuster movie. But those things don’t make him the all knowing source for what’s going to happen in the future. *A Random Walk Down Wall Street* does a great job marching through the history of successful market doomsday predictors. For every crash, there was a brilliant predictor who called it correctly. The media coronates them as the king or queen of knowing the future and happily publishes their next big predictions as front page news. Then, without fail, they’re never right again. Is Michael Burry going to be the one to change that track record? I doubt it.

###Michael Burry says a lot of stuff

In addition to betting against subprime mortgages, in 2015 [he talked about water as the next great investment](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/12/big-short-genius-says-another-crisis-is-coming.html), in 2018 [he opened a fund to invest in Asia stocks](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/918903/dr-michael-burry-of-big-short-likes-asia-stocks), in 2019 [he said GameStop is a good investment](https://www.barrons.com/articles/big-short-investor-michal-burry-is-now-long-gamestop-51566424832), and despite saying there is a large cap bubble, in 2019 his fund Scion Asset Management [invests in a lot of large cap stocks, like Google, FedEx and Western Digital](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/scion-asset-management-llc#tabholdings_tab_link). I don’t mean to imply Burry isn’t a smart guy. He definitely is. And he’s out there in the market competing against lots of other really smart people. The price of assets is being set based on where all those smart people are trading with each other. I don’t think doing everything Burry says is a good recipe to consistently beat the market.

###His own prediction says he invests in small cap stocks

And you know where small cap stocks are? In total stock market index funds. So you already own them if you own a fund like VTSAX or a target date index fund from Vanguard, Fidelity or Schwab.

###So what if it does crash?

Burry famously called the 2007 housing crash. But even KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW, if you went back in time and did the WORST POSSIBLE THING, you bought a home the DAY of the peak of the market in June of 2006, and simply held the property until today, your investment would be UP by 14.6%. And Burry didn’t call the day exactly. He was a few years off (so you would be up by even more). And he certainly doesn’t know the day of the next one. And even he did, market crashes are temporary, then the market rebounds. Instead of trying to time them, simply buy and hold and ignore the temporary changes in price.

###So what to do

Do what rich people do: Live below your means. Invest early and often. Buy and hold. Ignore the news.",finance

I filled this out and objected to the garnishment on the grounds that 15% of my “disposable income” was was a hardship and they sent paperwork back to me to fill out about my income and expenses and what I thought I could afford to pay. I did this and said $100 a month.  I still haven’t heard back from them and they received the paperwork on 9/17 and they have not yet garnished my pay. 

This week I received a Notice of Garnishment from GC Services. They say I owe them $115,000 and will begin garnishment on 10/23 if I don’t object. They list a number to call to work out a payment plan or the same type of fill out the form to object.

I have looked on studentaid.ed.gov and nslds.ed.gov and the total amounts they list there are less (total $157,000 vs. the $180,000 they claim) and they list MAXIMUS Federal Services, Inc as the loan servicer for default loans. 

Basically what should I do here?

I’m somewhat concerned that the servicer for defaulted loans listed on the site isn’t the people who are contacting me but if they have the right to garnish my pay I assume their legitimate.

And how does it work with who gets what? If they don’t agree to terms that I offered/negotiated for are they each entitled to 15% of my pay?

Thanks in advance for any help.",finance

I have not worked this year. All my income is from alimony.

I have $33,835 in a money market account that earns like 1.6% in interest per month. I CANNOT use this money at all because I used it and the alimony statement as proof of my income for my landlord so that I can rent my current apartment.

I get my medical insurance through the ACA and my dental insurance through COBRA.

I visited a tax person last week who told me I should pay $2000 to the government BEFORE Jan 15th. $1000 to the federal government and $1000 to my state government in order to avoid underpayment penalty.

What complicates matters is that I have $2000 in credit card debt. The interest rate on that debt is 1.99% that lasts till April 2020.

Currently have my cash holdings in wealthfront, at 2.07, but 2.42 is a big jump im willing to switch for.

Its just peculiar to be that there is so little about them when they offer one of the highest rates, when wealthfront announced its rate, it was all over the place and everyone was talking about it. So its just a red flag that nobody mentions them.",finance

(Bloomberg) -- General Electric Co.’s gaping pension deficit certainly stands out for its size. But the company is hardly the only one at risk of potentially shortchanging some of its employees come retirement.

All across corporate America, underfunded pensions have become the norm. Even now, a decade after the financial crisis, the largest plans face a shortfall of $269 billion, right about where it was 10 years ago. Years of low interest rates have largely offset gains in the stock market. Companies haven’t helped matters by lavishing money on shareholder rewards and clinging to assumptions about returns that proved to be too rosy.


Defined benefit plans, like your traditional corporate pensions, have largely disappeared from view in the past couple of decades as companies have embraced plans like 401(k)s. Employers can opt to contribute to those plans, but it’s the employees who are responsible for choosing the right investments and are solely on the hook if those investments fare poorly.",finance

financialindependence,"UPDATE: Hidden Taxes! We pay 6.34% in Federal Income Tax, but we still pay another 13.78% in State Income Tax, FICA Payroll Tax, Property Tax, and Sales Tax.","Over the weekend I  made this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ddqua0/we\_make\_150kyear\_yet\_our\_effective\_federal\_tax/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ddqua0/we_make_150kyear_yet_our_effective_federal_tax/)

Initially I was pleasantly surprised to find out that our Effective Federal Income Tax Rate on $150,000 of income was only 6.34%. My wife and I both max our Traditional 401(k)s and HSAs to help reduce our federal tax burden. I always assumed we paid closer to 20% in taxes (which is the assumption in my FIRE spreadsheet), so this was good news! This would means that our FIRE date would potentially move up by a couple years!

But then a few members of this fantastic community pointed out that I shouldn't forget things like the 7.65% FICA payroll tax, our state's income tax, property tax, and even sales tax.

This encouraged me to try and calculate the TOTAL amount of ALL taxes that we pay in a given year. Below is a breakout of each major type.

|Tax Type|Amount|%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Federal Income Tax|$9,504|31.5%|
|State Income Tax|$8,740|29.0%|
|City Income Tax|$0|0.0%|
|FICA Payroll Tax|$10,939|36.2%|
|Property Tax|$314|1.0%|
|Sales Tax|$650|2.2%|
|Car Tag Tax|$40|0.1%|
|**TOTAL TAXES PAID**|**$30,187**|**100.0%**|

I was then very surprised  to find out that our federal income taxes accounted for a much smaller amount of our total tax burden than I would have originally thought!

**Our Total Effective Tax Rate ended up being 20.12%** ($30,187/$150,000). Which is actually SLIGHTLY HIGHER than my FIRE spreadsheet assumption of 20.0%!

I figured this would be a helpful finding to share with the community because some of the ""smaller"" taxes we pay (like state, city, FICA, property, and sales taxes) can really add up and potentially have a big effect on our FIRE calculations.

**EDIT:** As a few of you have pointed out, in retirement taxes should be a bit lower (No FICA payroll taxes, untaxed Roth withdrawals, and lower income taxes for dividend and long-term capital gains in taxable account. So to get an accurate tax number for your FIRE spreadsheet, you would want to account for those changes.",finance

I've got $15k in student loans at an interest rate average of 3.8%, and a vehicle loan of $5k at 2.5%.

I am focused on building up my prepared fund to $10k, so that's where the first part of the gift will go.

I don't intend to pay off my student loans in advance... I've paid off the highest interest rate loan already, which was at 4.5%, and with my high interest rate savings account, I'm really only losing about 1% in interest on those.

Basically looking for a discussion on how I should invest in the short-term to allow my money to work for me, but also keep it accessible for larger purchases in the future (such as a starter home, or other investments where I need to have relatively liquid funds).

personalfinance,I helped my parents out and now I'm in debt,"I am a 24 year old full-time college student with a small part-time job that barely pays for transportation, internet, and food for myself and my younger siblings. I live with my father who is extremely financially unstable and irresponsible. I graduate next semester, and I am hoping to finally work full-time and start living on my own and take control of my finances. However, it seems like this is going to be impossible for me.

When I was 20 my father forced me to take a $3000 credit card out in my name to buy him a TV and computer for his new business. He promised me he would pay me back and this credit card would only be temporary. He was making good money at the time, so I believed him. However, his business sunk and he never prioritized the credit card payments so I'm still stuck with this debt. 

My parents also took a utility bill out in my name without my consent when we moved into our new house. The bill is currently at about $4000 and ConEdison is threatening to turn our electricity off.

My mother asked me to co-sign with her on a new car when I was 20 and I agreed because she told me she would work and pay it. Also, the car she was driving was extremely old and constantly breaking down and I wanted to help. However, I was foolish and naive. I didn't understand how finances worked in general or what to look out for and the car dealers took advantage of that. They told me I was going to be a co-signer but pushed the papers for being the main signer in front of me and fooled me into signing it because I had a higher credit score than my mother. I ended up getting a loan with an extremely high interest rate and my mother was unable to make any payments. I ended up voluntarily giving back the car and now have a remaining debt of about $2000.

For myself, I am about $15000 in student loan debt which I will have to begin paying once I graduate next year and I have a credit card that I owe $1500 on, and I pay that one on time.

My plan was to work and pay the loans off little by little after I graduate, but I don't know how long that will take and I want to go to graduate school soon. 

I'm afraid I'm never going to be able to move out and cut them off because I have terrible credit now and my parents refuse to take responsibility for these bills. I feel really stupid for trusting them and continuing to make the same mistakes with them but right now it honestly feels like I'm trapped.",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing my Co-Op,"I purchased my co-op six years ago on a 30 year fixed 4.625% interest rate. I’m considering refinancing to a 15 or 20 year mortgage to save some time and ultimately interest off of the total loan. My question is would this make sense financially? I’ve always heard refinancing is usually the last option someone should consider (due to fees and essentially starting your mortgage all over again). 

Another caveat is the co-op is co-owned by myself and ex-wife. She moved out 3-4 years ago prior to our divorce and in the divorce paperwork she gave up all ownership rights to the co-op. The thing is I have yet to take her name off of the co-op because I would have to refinance to only include my name but I never wanted to because I thought it didn’t make financial sense. Do I need her “permission” to refinance although she gave up her rights in writing through our divorce paperwork and hasn’t paid anything towards our mortgage in years?

There's a question on mortgage applications that asks if you have any delinquent federal debt. What are the ramifications of answering no/yes? If we answer yes, will it hurt our chances of being approved? If we answer no, will they find out about the debt themselves and decline it anyway? I read that you cannot get an FHA loan if you have outstanding federal debt. Is that the only reason why they ask this question? We pre-qualified for one FHA loan but we answered no on that question. Now we are shopping around and I'm second-guessing how we answered that question.

personalfinance,Debt while in College,"Im currently 21yrs old and going through online college, my parents live in New England, and im currently in North Carolina with my grandparents. Long story short I moved to kentucky 2 years ago, and lived on my own for a girl, which was a mistake. Opened an ATT acc and was paying for both of our phones. When I moved away to North Carolina me and my cousin opened up a Sprint account which they had told me would buy out my ATT contract which I submitted the paperwork for them to do so, and apparently Sprint denied it after waiting months to even get a response. So no I'm sitting in $1,500 debt with ATT (they told me they would cover $550 per line) which of course I would've been able to pay off that at the time but after waiting so long other expenses had shown up (ex: switching car plates, license) which costed roughly $600-700 when moving here after waiting until may to do so. As well as making a mistake and not paying my last electricity bill before moving which is now sitting in collections as well at $650, and credit at $650. So now im struggling to try to attempt to pay off roughly $3,000 worth of debt which I haven't been able to start since I will have to pay $1k for tuition after my federal loan runs out. (currently paying $500). I typically spend $240-280 for gas each month, and $200 for phone at sprint and car insurance combined. Since my income is $1,200,  


I know I typed this just about all over the place, im horrible at organization.

$1,200 Income

$3,000 in Debt

Monthly Expenses:

$500-600 College Tuition

$145 Sprint (phone bill)

$65 Car Insurance

$240-280 Gas

Roughly $80-100 food

Total Up to be : $1,030-$1,050

&amp;#x200B;

I have considered to get a second job which, when I do I will only have about a month or two to actually save/pay my debts before my loan runs out and i have to pay approx. $1,200 a month for tuition. It'll just be insanely stressful to work another part time job and attend college at the same time. Reason to why I want to pay it off by May: I'm planning to move to either the Clemson, or Conway area of South Carolina to hopefully attend college there or remain online and live near the area so that it will be easier for my transition. I'm planning on hopefully moving there by August/September of 2020.

My goal at the moment is to pay of my debts that are in collections by May. I have never been one to be in debt as I have always paid everything off on time, but this year I have been extremely stupid and not listened to myself.",finance

When would you consider pulling the trigger? Truth be told, my only interest is in lowering my monthly payment / interest rate. I just saw an offer for 3.125 with 0 dollars closing costs on Bankrate and got tempted. But something is telling me patience may pay off....",finance

personalfinance,Buying a new vehicle the best move?,"I'm in the market for a new vehicle and after much analysis I've found myself on the fence between buying brand new (2019) or CPO (certified pre-owned 2016-2018).

Vehicle I'm considering is the Hyundai Tucson Sport. Idea is to have this vehicle for an extended period of time, use for family, everyday driving, etc.

Buying a new mid level Tucson will run me around $30,000 (and that's if I negotiate a good deal) after taxes/reg/fees + an estimation of interest on a 60 month term and a 20% down payment. I should not that this number (\~$30,000) is the cost whether I use my own financing (3.39%) + incentives/rebates or dealer financing (0%) + incentives/rebates. Going the CPO route for example will run me around $20,000 for a 2017 model with around 25k miles after taxes/reg/fees + estimation of interest (4.46%) on a 48 month term and a 20% down payment.

I don't have any debt, earn a high income, and save over 50% of that income every month. Any guidance or advice from personal experience would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Buying a house; need advice about a collections debt we don't owe.,"I'll try to keep this brief but to the point without too many of my internal frustrations;

Spouse didn't pull his CR to find out why his equifax was 622, come to find out now, it's because of a $900 medical collections hit we paid several years ago (with proof) and; it's not our debt.

This collections is for a debt we paid to a college university hospital for his son but, they and the collections company which it was eventually sent to have refused to acknowledge our payment or respond to our letters.

This is not our debt, it is my spouses son's who was 18 years old when he was at college and, I suspect this credit hit came from when I (with some debt collections experience) drafted an unfair debt collections practice letter to the collector demanding verification of the debt or stopping all attempts.

They didn't verify or even acknowledge my letter according to our son. Instead they hit my spouses credit report with a collections.

This has dropped our CS by over 50 points resulting in a 1.5% increase in interest rate over what we were expecting and, we are supposed to close within 30-45 days. This is new construction so it is basically dependent on when the house is finished. 

Without my knowledge, my spouse disputed the hit which immediately started the process and removed it form our consumer CS. Our per-qualification loan officer is telling us that this will actually reduce our 'lender' CS even further though.

We being told to expect an even higher interest rate on a nearly 500K mortgage now which will result in thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in extra interest.

At this juncture, I do not have the certified green card I told my son to send by when he sent the verification letter but will ask if he can send us a copy tomorrow.  I told my spouse we should hire an attorney to sue for damages.  I've thought about filing complaints to my home state's AG and the AG where the debt was incurred but at this stage I think legal action is the inevitable course of action so I should probably leave it to the attorney. We've been dealing with this for over 2 years now without any success and now they've hit our CS for something we paid that, I do not see how we legally owe.",finance
investing,"ELI5: Why isn't 0% interest rate a ""magic number""?","I keep hearing that the ""magic number"" for interest rates (for bonds, money market, etc) is inflation, because if the rate is above inflation your buying power goes up over time, and if it's below inflation your buying power goes down. So I get that inflation is *a* magic number.

But isn't 0 a magic number too because you can just hold cash whenever you want? That means anyone, at any time, for any length of time, cancellable at any time, can have a 0% 'bond' just by stashing money. If the going rates for bonds and savings accounts are negative, you'll have to pay a bit for a bank to hold the money for you, so maybe the magic number is a *little* bit below 0, but it should be close right?

I hear negative bonds are all over Europe and Greece just started issuing them recently. I can't comprehend this. Explain how this 0 isn't significant plz. In small words.",finance

Spoude Fed Student Loan - 6.45%, balance $8,800, min. payment $110

I'm aware of snowball vs avalanche, and according to highest interest first I should start with the LOC. For the other two, am I better off getting rid of the lower balance first to free up that min payment and then funneling that towards the higher balance, or should I put it on the higher balance since that has a longer period left, meaning more of each min. payment will be going to principal vs interest for a longer period? There is also a temptation to put it on the student loans before the LOC since there is such a small difference in interest rate and once those are gone they are gone forever, freeing up those min payments.

personalfinance,First Job Advice,"Hello all and thanks for taking the time to read my post.

I'm a college student in Austin set to graduate in December and take a full time job working in the Portland area. I had a couple of questions which I'd like some advice regarding that I was hoping the greater Reddit community would be able to shed some light on.

Firstly I am looking at getting a new car and I was wondering what the implications were of buying in Texas or Oregon. Something that has been brought to my attention is that registration will need to be changed to Oregon at some point, and with Texas inspection expiring after only a year I may have to deal with complicated tax laws when registering in Oregon within such a short time frame from time of purchase. I know ideally you're supposed to change registration in 3-6 months or something, but I figure it may be more cost effective to just ignore that rule until I need to get reinspected and hope I don't get a ticket along the way, though I imagine it would be relatively small if I did get one. One of the things going into this decision is whether or not I can stay on my parent's insurance or if I have to get my own plan with the car registered to an address in Oregon. I think of myself as a pretty modest person when it comes to material goods, but I think it's worth also asking what kind of budget I should be looking at for vehicle? I'm hoping for a crossover or hatchback with awd/4wd and clearance to support my outdoor hobbies especially given the area that I'll be in. I was hoping to buy something domestic, my last car was an import and I had a pretty poor experience with it, and was thinking Toyota, Honda, or Jeep. I've heard good things about Subaru as well though. Any advice on brand for longevity? Lastly should I be looking at purchasing outright or taking out a loan?

Secondly I have a little bit of student debt, just under 15k, and I was wondering what kind of time frame I should be focusing on to pay it off. I have \~30k in savings (minus whatever I spend on travel over winter break), my expected salary is \~80k plus bonuses, and I will have a signing bonus of \~6k. I think I could reasonably pay off all of it in \~2-3 months but is it worth rushing to do that, or should I wait to pay it all off and focus on paying it off over a year or two in smaller installments? I know to focus on the loans with higher interest rates, is there anything else to consider when paying them?

Lastly, I'm open to any sage advice for a person just starting their journey into the weird world of adulthood and fiscal independence. Any general advice is happily appreciated.

I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts :)",finance
personalfinance,Looking for auto loans/ does it make sense.,"Hello PF, joined this sub since I started using reddit (which has only been a few months now) and love the advice on here.

So I'm 21 making $55k (around $62k with bonuses throughout the year).

Looking to buy a new to me car. Been eyeing the 2017 is350f. Waiting until late this year or early next year to buy it. Most leases will be back by then and the price would have dropped a bit more. Aiming to pay no more than $30k for it.


I think an $8k downpayment is enough. I've heard not to put down too much money on newer cars. I've done a ton of research on this car and the sweet spot to buy it is around the 3 year old mark. Also buying this car because it's reliable, AWD, holds its value pretty well after the 3yr mark and has a tiny amount of fun. Decided to be an adult and buy a reliable practical car instead of a fun car.

I want to join a credit union as historically they have better rates, but idk which to join. 

I know of the 20% rule for car notes. I make about $2700 a month after taxes, 401,etc. So 20% lands me at $540. Depending the interest rate, financing 22k at 60 months with a 6% interest (being conservative, hoping for a 3-4%) should give me a payment about $425 a month.

I feel can definitely afford this. I spend very little money besides my 3 or 4 small bills, but wanted another opinion. Just in case I'm blinded by the want of a newer car.

personalfinance,Mortgage: Am I better off making extra repayments to my mortgage? or funneling it through a savings account first?,"I'll get right to the point.

* Loan amount is for $390,000 to cover a few life expenses. Bank is adamant on giving me the whole amount. Once life expenses have been covered I will have $42,000 left over.
* The interest rate on the loan is 5.84% p.a. variable rate, compounded daily. 
* The loan term is 30 years, with repayments of $2,298.28 direct debited from my account every month
* There is a $15 monthly service fee on the loan.
* Any additional payments made to the loan, outside of the $2,298.28 costs $1.00 to process.
* My savings account offers a 2% p.a interest rate, compounded monthly, on balances up to $100,000 - this is where my loan repayment is debited from.
* I can afford to make an extra $5,051.72 per month on top of my obligatory 2,298.28 (making my total repayment of $7350).

Here are my scenarios:

1. I can put the $42,000 back onto the loan straight away, and make my monthly payment of $2,298.28, plus my extra $5050.72 per month (includes $1 processing fee deduction)
2. I can put the $42,000 into my savings account, to earn interest, as well as make payments of $7350.00 to it every month. The $2298.28 would come out of the account every month. Once the balance of the savings account reaches $100,000 (or close to), withdraw \~$80,000(this number is variable) to the loan in a lump sum payment.

Obviously there are a few scenarios you could make in between those 2 by varying certain aspects, but I'm not sure if interchanging them will help (or hurt) my scenario. I've tried working this out in excel, but I'm an idiot and couldn't get the loan amortization sheet going.

This may be a lot &amp; I'm not sure how much of it will be relevant but I'd rather include far too much information than too little. 

I'm 20 years old, and I'm in college full time. My parents pay rent &amp; utilities on my apartment, so I have little to no out of pocket expenses at this point. I also have no income, and have been ""prohibited"" from getting a job. The reasoning behind that is that they want me to focus on school - which I understand, but the hidden reasoning behind it is that they want to continue to control me and have ""finances"" as something to hold over my head and use as a guilt trip. This isn't new. By ""prohibiting"" me from getting a job, I presume that if I were to do so, they would be not only unhappy (not sure how much that would do other than stick me in uncomfortable situations with them) but would cease paying for my tuition/rent/gas/etc. I don't think that as a full-time student, I'd be able to pay all of those things *and* put any money into savings on a part time salary at a job in which I have no prior experience. 

The sticky part here is that I have approximately $3,400 in credit card debt. This was reckless spending as soon as I turned 18 and was able to taste freedom for the first time - online purchases, a couple of plane tickets, things of that nature added up very quickly. This is spread across 3 credit cards, one is an Amazon store card with a \~$500 balance. That card is still ""active"" but hasn't been used anytime recently. It is overdue and I don't really have a way of making the minimum payments. I also have a generic credit card with a \~$450 balance. I have made (minimum) payments on that for the entire time I've had it, and I don't use the card unless necessary. The main chunk of debt is on a Paypal credit card with a balance of \~$2400. I've closed the actual card account so no more purchases can be made on it, but I've racked up interest and late fees from an 18 year old mindset of ""ignoring it until it goes away."" 

I know that I was irresponsible in the past and it's something I've been working on. I have a credit card on which I'm an authorized user that I can charge groceries/gas/etc. on that my parents pay for. They use this card to monitor where I go &amp; what I do. I've been transferring money to myself from that card via Paypal and making charges on my own debit card if I need to buy something or go somewhere that I don't want them to track and question me about. Instead, I've been questioned about the Paypal charges and usually tend to create some school-related expense. I intended to try and come up with an excuse of needing $500 (the minimum payment due in 10 days on my Paypal credit card) but I was given the third degree by my parents tonight about everything charged on their credit card, so I don't think that's going to fly. I've been getting credit card statements to my parents' address, which they haven't begun opening yet but I won't be surprised if they start to. I can't seem to be able to change my billing address without providing verification information which I don't really have, as my ID still lists my parent's address and I don't have the means to change it. 

I'm willing to get a job if I can find one. I have a car (again, paid for by my parents) and am in college full-time, but could try working evenings after school. I'm expected to drive to my hometown to spend time with my parents nearly every weekend (\~3 hours away) so I haven't been able to get a weekend part time job. It took a lot of convincing for them to allow me to have a car and live on my own (I was only allowed to get my license in July) - for the past two years, I lived on-campus at my university and my parents drove the 3 hours to pick me up and drive me home &amp; back every weekend. 

I realize there are a lot of issues that I need to deal with in my life, but the financial one is what's bothering me the most. I've recently begun seeing a therapist through my university (that does not go through my parents' insurance, so they aren't aware of this) and worked on dealing with some of my own mental health issues that are largely a result of this situation. However, my credit score is dropping into the low 500's and I realize it's only getting worse. I've tried signing up for a program referred to by my apartment complex that records my on-time rent payments and reports them to presumably help my credit score - this is a $6/month charge that I intend to keep, but I've only had it for a couple of weeks and haven't yet seen the information reflected on my credit. I assumed it was legit since it was offered by my apartment complex, but I guess I could be wrong. 

Essentially I have about $300 to my name and a chunk of credit card debt that my parents know nothing about. They have plenty of money, and I think that's another reason they insist on my not getting a job &amp; my own income - they are fully capable of paying for my living expenses and are using it as a way to continue controlling my life as best they can from a distance. 

Do I have options for finding a job in a situation like this? I've looked at taking out a loan to pay off the credit card debt &amp; just have the loan at a lower interest rate instead, but I (unsurprisingly) don't seem to be eligible. I thought about looking into getting a private student loan as if I had to pay my own tuition and using the money that way, but I realize that's not a good idea. Can I even get a job that will pay me to an address that I'm not really ""documented"" at? I'm in class about 6 hours per day, but I can try working evenings if I could find a place that would be flexible on that. I am worried about keeping up with school on top of that and I'm hesitant because I don't want to ruin my education/progress because I see being able to get a good job in the future as really important to breaking free from my parents once &amp; for all. I worked part-time in high school and made a few hundred dollars here &amp; there by working for a non-profit (which my dad also worked for) but I have no experience looking for jobs or being paid by one. Assuming I have to file taxes, is that something that can also be hidden from my parents? Is there a way to get that information to my ""local"" address instead of going to my ""permanent residence"" to be intercepted by my parents? 

I realize this is probably a lot more information than necessary and may be out of the range of this sub - I was unsure where to go for advice and this seemed like a good starting point. Recommendations for a more appropriate subreddit if necessary would also be welcome.",finance

I was hoping to get a question answered about withdrawing large amounts of cash, banks/ATMs, and IRS stuff. I tried doing my research, but I am not well-versed on this subject and would really appreciate some advice!

I am heading to something called a ""Magic the Gathering Magic Fest"" next month in which I intend to purchase collectible cards as a treat to myself for becoming fully independent financially.

I was planning to spend around $15\~20k at the convention, but I heard that most vendors were willing to haggle down to very appealing prices if the buyer offers cash (for obvious reasons).

I wanted to withdraw the cash from my bank account (If this information is helpful, I have about $200k spread across Checking, Savings, and Brokerage accounts) but I recently moved to an area where there is no Bank Teller near me, only atms (citibank).

I'm not sure, but I think my only option is to withdraw from an atm, but something feels really wrong about going to an ATM withdrawing \~$200 multiple times, every day. Not only does that seem extremely suspicious, I'm worried that the bank will get worried and think I'm committing structural transactions. Committing a blatant criminal felony is something I'd like to avoid.

Given my situation, I'm not exactly sure what is the best way of obtaining \~$20k in cash. For IRS reporting reasons, what is the best thing I should say in this regard? Are there any extra fees I will have to pay? What should I expect?

For reference, this will be the 1st large transaction I've ever had aside from transferring inheritance money overseas. I also contributed $5k to my parents' kitchen renovation, but that is under the $10k federal limit.

personalfinance,Possible to make a deal to settle credit card balance ?,"So right now i have 2 cards. One (oldest card) is maxed out with $4200 owing that i consistently pay the 3% minimum on monthly and the other is a $3000 limit with nothing owing. My $3000 limit card is offering me a 2% balance transfer. The good thing is this card also has a lower rate in general (11.99% vs 19.89%). This is good because unlike my other card this company charges the minimum payment based on the interest rate and not just a flat 3% fee. So even when the 2% balance transfer promo is over i will end up with manageable minimum payments.

Now i was told that i could try and make a deal with my credit card company and see if they would take a lump sum of $3000 (since $3000 is my limit on my other card) or less to settle the $4200 debt. The problem is i have never missed a payment yet so the credit card companies in house collections dept. can't make a deal with me since they don't get involved until there is a missed payment.

Now my questions are, is it worth missing a payment on purpose to try and make a deal with the collection dept. ? Also is this sort of deal even possible ?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",finance

devops,Can DDoS attacks harm your server and how to prevent them?,"DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack is one of the most common forms of cyber-attacks these days. Their scale already exceeds one terabit per second and over 2000 of such attacks are being observed daily by [Arbor Networks](https://www.digitalattackmap.com/understanding-ddos/). So, should you care? Surely! It’s important to secure your network to stay calm and ensure uninterrupted services to your customers.

**Possible Harm**

DDoS attacks disturb regular tasks of a targeted computer system by flooding it with bogus traffic from numerous compromised machines. As a simple example, if your e-commerce site is under DDoS attack, your customers are withheld from placing new orders. If it’s a call center, your clients cannot make or receive calls. If it’s a booking engine, your clients are not able to make new reservations. In other terms, your service is being denied. Still, can these service disruptions make a lasting impact on your system and harm your customer base? Let’s try to answer this point by point.

* **Service disruption.** First and foremost, DDoS attacks deny access to your website or services. The attacker abuses a network of infected or misconfigured machines – servers, routers or even PCs - to generate enormous amounts of bogus traffic to a single system, making it temporarily unavailable.
* **Higher costs.** Most hosting and cloud providers charge their clients for additional bandwidth or computing power. When you are having a DDoS attack, your ingress traffic skyrockets and your infrastructure may start scaling out very rapidly, if auto-scaling is enabled. You might get surprised when you receive your next bill, because of the Internet traffic and computing resources expenses that have gone through the roof this month. Do not forget to check your provider's [bandwidth policy](https://docs.cherryservers.com/knowledge/what-is-cherry-servers-bandwidth-policy) to avoid such bills.
* **Data loss.** Because of an overwhelmed data base and system, unsaved work might not be stored or cached. This may be a serious issue for businesses that deal with mission-critical workloads or run some online transaction processing application where data consistency is paramount.
* **Intermixed logs.** Your real server logs will mix up with thousands of attack logs, so it will be hard to filter and check if everything works correctly. Alternatively, you may have set if-then rules and made your system self-reactive. In such case, intermixed logs may hurt you a lot by causing real damage to your system.
* **Distraction.** DDoS can be used as a distraction technique. While you are busy filtering your traffic, small damaging attacks are executed simultaneously. Such an attack happened a few months ago with [Electrum](https://electrum.org/) Bitcoin wallet, which said to be the safest cold wallet in the world. A huge DDoS attack from over 150 000 infected hosts has been launched onto Electrum network, disrupting all customer transactions. In parallel, a phishing attack [forced a roguish message](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/4968) to be popped out to clients, asking them to update their software. People then mistakenly installed malicious software, which immediately pointed all their savings to the scammer’s wallet.  


**How to avoid DDoS?**

As DDoS attacks keep growing in volume and frequency, we should prevent them from making harm to your projects. You should plan ahead to secure your network and minimize the impact of such intrusion. So how to prevent ddos attacks?

* **Choose a cloud provider** that offers DDoS protection. Most hosting and cloud providers offer basic protection against most popular DDOS attacks such as UDP, NTP, SSDP, CharGen, DNS. However, this will not make you 100% bulletproof. Some providers also offer advanced security measures like [DDoS scrubbing protection](https://docs.cherryservers.com/knowledge/ddos-scrubbing) that gives you customized real-time protection based on machine learning algorithms. It takes time for AI model to learn and recognize malicious traffic, but after some time, this protection should filter and block up to 100% of incoming DDoS attacks. 
* **Build redundant infrastructure.** Spread your project across multiple data centers with a good load balancing system to distribute traffic. This works best when you choose data centers in different countries or at least use different Internet service providers.
* **Defend manually.** If you can access your server when being under attack, adjust the following network configuration rules to protect your system:  
\- rate limit your router to prevent your Web server from being overwhelmed;  
\- add filters to tell your router to drop packets from obvious sources of attack;  
\- timeout half-open connections more aggressively;  
\- drop spoofed or malformed packages;  
\- set lower SYN, ICMP, and UDP flood drop thresholds;
* **Keep it fresh.** Always update your software to the latest version. It not only protects you from bugs and vulnerability exploits but also helps you avoid DDoS attacks. For example, some older software allows unlimited ping-backs without an option to set a limit on them.
* **Review your DNS zones.** We usually forget the simple things. Make sure you have no testing domains or abandoned subdomains that run outdated software. Check whether there are any mistakenly added A records. Audit your DNS zones, CNAME and MX records to make sure everything has been set as you intended.
* **Hide your BIND version.** Hackers often find their targets by running scripts that target specific versions of network software. An attacker could easily gain your DNS server version by running a simple query like this: dig @ns1.server.com -c CH -t txt version.bind   
You can hide your BIND version by editing /ets/named.conf file. Locate options configuration block and change version ""BIND""; to a word of your choice. For example version ""Unknown""; Save the file and restart BIND to apply change service named restart
* **Disable DNS recursion**. DNS cache poisoning is one of the most usual DNS attacks. This happens when a spoofing attack is initiated in the middle, giving information to a DNS server that hasn’t been authorized by DNS sources. Such vulnerability allows traffic redirection from one host to another. Still, you can easily avoid this. To disable DNS recursion, add these lines inside the options configuration block inside named.conf file:  
allow-transfer {“none”;};  
allow-recursion {“none”;};  
recursion no;  
Restart your BIND to apply changes service named restart
* **Use 3rd party DDoS mitigation provider.** If you get tons of attacks and cannot handle them by yourself, you should call for help DDoS protection specialists. There are several well-known providers like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), [Imperva](https://www.imperva.com/products/ddos-protection-services/) and [CloudLayar](https://cloudlayar.com/) that offer basic DDoS protection packages for a low price. In case you are in a deep trouble, call their support and ask a system audit to find any additional vulnerabilities. Keep in mind, while basic packages cost near to nothing, advanced DDoS protection is not cheap.  


**Conclusion**

Hackers are getting better each day with more and more methods available for finding vulnerable systems on the Internet. Nevertheless, there are now a lot of ways to protect your business and avoid DDoS attacks whatsoever. Do not hesitate to take preventative actions in advance and you will sleep well at night.

personalfinance,How To Leave Elan Financial Credit Card?,"Hi Reddit,

I'm currently a credit card holder with Elan Financial services with a current interest rate between 21% -24%. I'm unsatisfied.

I have $340.00 left to pay off. How do I slowly end my business with this credit card company? I want to move on to another credit card merchant that works best in my favor.

This is a rewards points card and I have 13,600 points.

Here are my reasons for wanting to leave:
&gt;&gt; On your bill due date, you must pay before 7p. If you do not, your charged a $40.00 late fee.

(This an important note: I manually set up scheduled payments. But there are one of situatuons where you forget and you go to pay on your due date but the bank penalizes clients still if paid after 7p. Why can't I comfortably pay my credit card at any time throughout the day.)

&gt;&gt; Customer service is awful. Every now and then you'll get a good customer service agent. But, I've experienced really terrible reps over the years.

&gt;&gt; I like to personalize my cards. They don't offer good card designs.

&gt;&gt; Their mobile app isn't always up to date. It sometimes takes two days for you to see updated information, especially with spending.

If you have any advice, suggestions, and reasons for why I shouldn't go, anything is helpful.

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,What happens when a loan cosigner declares bankruptcy?,"My wife is the primary on two student loans, one private and one federal. Her father is the cosigner and there is rumor in the family he is toying with the idea of bankruptcy (he is currently estranged from most of the family due to a contentious divorce in the last year). My wife &amp; I make payments on time for each loan, so they are in good standing, but I read [this article](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/credit-card-loan-cosigner-death-bankruptcy-what-happens/) that says: ""If your cosigner dies or declares bankruptcy, your entire balance becomes due. If you aren’t able to pay off the entire balance right away, your loan will go to default.""

Why would this happen if we have been paying the loan on time and it is in good standing? Both loans together are a little over $40K so if the entire balance becomes due all at once, we have no hope of paying it off in one chunk like that.

Does anyone have experience with a cosigner declaring bankruptcy? What will happen? Is this article accurate?",finance

A key measure of U.S. consumer prices rose by less than expected in September as used-car costs fell by the most in a year, potentially bolstering the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the third time in three months.

The core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, increased 0.1% from the prior month, a Labor Department report showed Thursday, below the median estimate of economists. The annual gain of 2.4% matched projections as well as the August increase. The broader CPI was unchanged on the month and up 1.7% annually, trailing projections.",finance

In March, I finished my PhD in molecular biology (tuition waived and minimal stipend given), and I now have a job in the Bay Area with a medium-sized biotech start up.

My federal loan amount owed is \~$120,000 and I make $83,000/year gross. I have 7 federal loans, and I will be attacking them with the avalanche method. I am on the REPAYE repayment plan, and my minimum payment is $50.16 because of filing my taxes last year with my PhD stipend as my income. My interest rates on these loans range from 6.5-7.9%.

After making my minimum payment, I will put any extra money towards the loan with the highest interest rate. Should I be doing anything about the interest accruing on the 6 other federal loans or should I let the interest accrue until I'm ready to start attacking those loans? I am accruing $22.74 daily interest combined for these 7 loans.

personalfinance,Advice on Getting &amp; Staying Out of CC Debt,"**Background**: I grew up in a hard-working family and we lived very comfortably. My dad was a dentist, my mom was a financial planner/analyst for a successful corporation. The area we lived in was upper middle class and I went to private high school, and an expensive out of state college. Even though my parents could pay for things, they always made me work for them instead. For example, I worked all summer to afford a $3k snowboarding trip in Mt. Hood in my teens.  I had a great upbringing where everything I needed was provided, and almost everything I wanted, I attained.

**Current Adult Problem**: With my background, I think I've never grown up worried about money. I've always been taken care of, had what I needed, worked for what I wanted. It's never been a scarcity within my psyche. It just... is part of life. So my work ethic is there, but my financial situation as an adult isn't great. I own a house with my husband (mortgage), I own my own car (no car loan here so no debt). I have a very well paying job ($80K+) and have some side hustles as well as an artist/maker. Regardless, my CC debt is out of control and my credit score is dipping. I have zero concept of personal budgeting. I have never learned it and have a really hard time wrapping my head around it. I have tried to ask for financial advice from my mom, but her thing is that when she was growing up, there weren't any credit cards so you just wrote checks or paid in cash. She also has tried to make budgets for me to stick to, but I was young and lazy and didn't take the time to fill them out. She also has the 'money scarcity' thing in her psyche so never indulges and every pleasure is also a financial burden in a way, and I just don't have this gene. So here I am, 30+ years old and in bad CC debt. I'd like to have this paid off before kids come into the picture.

**Advice needed**:

\- Should I take out a personal loan to consolidate my CC debt and have one monthly payment for the next 3-5 years? **I have about $25k in CC debt over 3 cards. Interest rate is about 15%**

\- If so, how can I prevent myself from doing this again in the future?

\- Specifically interested in hearing advice from people who are non-financial people and are creatives, artists, etc. that have gone into CC debt and are no longer in it. How did you turn things around and keep them that way?

***Edit:*** My current CC debt and interest rate is below for better reference on what I'm working with... Also, outside of general financial advice, also looking for the psychological advice on living within my means...

personalfinance,Investing in ETFs/Index/Mutual Funds for the first time,"The recent interest rate drop resulted in myself among many questioning whether to leave their liquid cash in a HYSA. I became frustrated at the changes over the last 6 months from 2.2% to 2% to 1.9% to today's 1.8%.

Although my mindset when I created this account was that I would grow this money slowly with no risk, I am warming up to the idea of some risk, to make my returns less laughable. For context, I've earned $420 on $44,000 in 6 months. I will leave a 6-12 month emergency fund in the HYSA, but I want to start making my money work for me. I would be okay with moderate risk. I do not have an employer sponsored retirement plan, but rather a Roth IRA that I plan on maxing out by year's end.

worldpolitics,"In light of the recent situation in Syria, you should study baathism and the drive for a unified Arab Republic between Iraq and Syria. This is the whole reason we are at war there.","This is the whole reason we are in these countries. Assad and many Iraqi elites planned to unify. They would control a path connecting the Mediterranean sea and Persian gulf. This would undermine oil control in the region and split the Eurasia Asian African nexus there. They would also control nearly 40% of reserves. They wanted a Muslim ran gvt that allowed regional powers through federal municipalities. The kurds, jews, Christians, druze, and so on could self govern their regions but all be nationally aligned thus destroying the secular divisions often used to statt wars. All people would have their beliefs but be nationally aligned in pride. This also is a huge issue with water. The baathist state would control ports and the tigres and eufrates rivers and the watersheds.

The 2 wars only slowed this down but haven't ended it as many Iraqis and Syrians want this. Terrorist didn't topple Assad. Now, they want turkey to lay claim, Israel to lay claim and the kurds to lay claim. Assad wouldn't be able to hold all 3 in check. This is their new plan to crush the baathist unification. It was to be called the united Arab Republic. Israel wouldn't be able to take over the west bank and Saudi wouldn't control oil.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%27athism

https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/07/baathism-caused-the-chaos-in-iraq-and-syria/

&gt;Ba'athism (Arabic: البعثية‎, al-Baʿathīyah IPA: [alˈbaʕθija], from بعث baʿath IPA: [baʕθ], meaning ""renaissance"" or ""resurrection"") is an Arab nationalist ideology that promotes the development and creation of a unified Arab state through the leadership of a vanguard party over a progressive revolutionary government. The ideology is officially based on the theories of the Syrian intellectuals(and to some extent, extremists) Michel Aflaq (according to the Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party), Zaki al-Arsuzi (according to the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party) and Salah al-Din al-Bitar. 

&gt;A Ba'athist society seeks enlightenment, renaissance of Arab culture, values and society. It supports the creation of one-party states and rejects political pluralism in an unspecified length of time – the Ba'ath party theoretically uses an unspecified amount of time to develop an enlightened Arabic society. Ba'athism is based on principles of Arab nationalism, pan-Arabism, Arab socialism as well as social progress and it is a secular ideology. A Ba'athist state supports socialist economics to a varying degree and supports public ownership over the heights of the economy, but opposes the confiscation of private property. Socialism in Ba'athist ideology does not mean state socialism or economic equality, but modernisation and Ba'athists believe that socialism is the only way to develop an Arab society which is free and united. 

&gt;The two Ba'athist states which have existed (Iraq and Syria) forbade criticism of their ideology through authoritarian governance. These governments have been labelled as neo-Ba'athist because the form of Ba'athism developed in Iraq and Syria was very different from the Ba'athism of Aflaq and al-Bitar. 

&gt;Syria and Iraq formally ended more than twenty years of diplomatic estrangement, when Syria's foreign minister, Walid Muallem, visited Iraq in 2006, which was the first such meeting since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.[10] Ambassadors were established later in 2006.[11] On 23 August 2009 the Iraqi government aired a taped conversation linking two members of the Syria-based Iraqi Ba'athist movement, Sattam Farhan and Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed, with the August 2009 Baghdad bombings which claimed more than 100 lives.[11] The Syrian foreign ministry denied Syrian involvement in the attack. On 25 August Iraq summoned its ambassador to return from Syria, the Syrian government issued a similar order to its ambassador within hours in retaliation.[11] Responsibility for the attack was later claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq.[11]

personalfinance,I need help filing my taxes as someone who's self employed. I have NO IDEA what I'm doing,"So, I'm 22 and a freelancer. I do freelance content writing for a Canadian marketing company. I have never filed my taxes as a freelancer before because I'm new to this. My sister told me that freelancers are supposed to file a 1099. She told me it's easy and she'll help me with it but now she won't and I don't know what I'm doing. I'm trying to file for 2018 and I had to file an extension and now I have like 5 days until the extension is up and I still don't know how to file.

I was going to do things through Turbotax, which is what I usually use. However, it seems like to file as a freelancer, you have to use their pro version which is like 60 dollars. Not only that, they want to add on another $40 bucks because I'm trying to also file for the state I was in at the time as well, even though that's something the free version covers. So, I would be owing 170 in taxes as well as 100 in Turbotax pro fees. I Cannot Afford That. I make 350 a month and I have to be able to pay rent and buy food. The 170 in taxes is stressing me out enough as it is.

Unfortunately, the IRS website is practically in ANOTHER LANGUAGE and I have NO IDEA what I'm supposed to do.

I didn't know about this and now that my deadline is like 5 days out, if I tried ordering the forms, I would end up filing late and I have no idea what that would do.

Many of these banks have already been caught stealing from customers by assessed extended overdrawn balance charges that violate the National Bank Act’s usury limit.

Hiding behind imagined conspiracies and fraud, my own bank has delayed a legitimate lump sum payment check. For a bank that processes the accounts of millionaires, it seems egregious that a major retirement fund would be flagged for fraud.

Regulation CC stipulates four types of holds that a bank may place on a check deposit at its discretion. And yes we understand that each has its own qualifications and it is legal for the bank to place any type **where the requirements are met:**  “If the total check deposits into one account on the same business day is over $5000, then $200 must available on the first business day, $600 on the second, $4800 on the 3rd, and the remainder must be available on the 7th business day.”

If I roll the money over to an IRA, the entire amount will get transferred to the account. 

Money is very tight right now but I think I should open an IRA, it seems like the smartest and safest idea. 

Here are my questions/concerns:

- Are there any IRAs that don't require a minimum opening balance? I can’t afford much right now. Some have $500 minimum opening balance and I struggle to even come up with that. 

- Do I have to make monthly payments to the IRA account to keep it open?

- Would I need to specifically open a rollover IRA in order to roll the money over?

- Is my pension payment/check protected from creditors that I may owe money to, and judgments that I may have against me?

Ideally I want to transfer the entire balance to a traditional IRA and then take out the money when I need it, and I need some of it badly right now. I'm 60 so I won't have to pay that additional 10% for being under 59 1/2.

Anyway, I got approved for $15,000 to pay off my credit card debt, that spiked up due to medical bills (dumb thing to do, I know). Payments are $378, which I can afford the monthly payments, no problem but I unfortunately don’t know anyone who has taken a personal loan so that’s why I’m here. Does the attached look normal? Am I getting screwed here? The interest rate is lower than my credit card, which is why I’m doing this. I’m sure this is a stupid question but where it says that over the course of the loan, I’ll be paying $22,000. That’s due to the interest right? Does this sound like I’m making the right move?

personalfinance,"Have 4 months to pay an outstanding tuition balance, unsure what to do","Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 20 years old and a junior in college studying engineering. My family strictly doesn't help me out with money such as tuition or rent and here is my current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an $8,000 outstanding balance on my tuition from the 2019 Spring semester (last year) and the financial aid office at my school told me that my balance has to be zero before the start of next semester or else I won't be able to register for my classes. I can spare $2,400 from my 2019-2020 loan to pay some of it, and that leaves me with around $5,600 that I need to come up with fast, or else I'll have problems with the registrar.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked them if I could pay the $2,400 this semester and pay the rest next semester but for some reason they said no. They said I can come in and work out a payment plan to get it paid off within 4 months, but a payment plan is absolutely useless if at the end of the day I still don't physically have the money.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said asking my family for money isn't an option. I'm thinking that my two options are:

1) Try to retroactively get a loan for LAST year to pay it off, if that's even possible.

2) Use my credit card (along with having to open up a couple more) to pay it off and absolutely wreck my credit score. I really really really don't want to do this because I won't be able to pay it off until I work full-time during the Summer and it'll really hurt my credit. IfI have no option other than being kicked out of school then I might have to do it though

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody have any advice here?  

TL;DR I really want to do the (1)st option obviously but I don't know if it's even possible to retroactively get a loan for LAST year's schooling without it being a federal plus loan being in my parents' name which my parent's won't let me do.

worldpolitics,The Loddhist Manifesto,"***The Loddhist Manifesto***

The individual at the bottom of society will always complain of being oppressed, underfed, and overworked. That individual will always complain of being treated unfairly by the general public, the government and the private sector. Do not dismiss this as an unthought-out plea; for proof you need simply observe the popularity of the Labour Party in the UK. Their policies (as of 2019) include the implementation of a national bank to solve the monetary problems of general public, the imposition of a maximum wage, government-enforced seizures of property belonging to the wealthy people, and more.

The situation in Britain today is very similar to what it was once in Russia in the decades before the Russian revolution (almost universal anger at the rich, big corporations, and everything and everyone connected with them). The difference is that no bloody civil war is necessary to improve it. Therefore, there is nothing to stop a taking of power by the Labour party in the general election, something that, for the preservation of the economy, must be avoided by all means. The problem with the society as The Labour Party envisions it is that there would be no incentive for any individual to attempt to enrich themselves, for if they attempted to do so, they would have to suffer a punitive income tax rate. If no individuals attempt to enrich themselves by gaining a position of importance, (that is managing a business, or any job that involves dealing with larger-than-average sums of money), or at least, no pragmatic individuals that wish to generate income, then the economic apparatus of the country would not be held by those that are the most suited to hold them, but instead be held by those who simply wish to 'do what is right for the people'. As a result of this, the new owners would attempt to cut prices, and ~~up~~ improve quality at the same time. If the system is not already operating at full efficiency, then this can be done. But what, then, must happen when the system is running at the maximum possible efficiency?

The result would be that the system would have to pursue one of three paths.

1. Keep the system as it is, never attempting to make another improvement lest it involves price rises.
2. Continue to improve the system while compromising the ideals of the very system that it was built upon. That is, an end to price rises while giving high-quality services to the people. No different to the capitalist way, which The Labour Party is so thoroughly against.
3. Continue to improve the system and cut prices while the business generates a loss. This will result in the nationalised industries draining the government budget. Perhaps The Labour Party is planning to actually make all the newly nationalised services free.  
I am almost entirely certain that The Labour Party would be planning to implement option 3, but then, where would the extra money needed to sustain, and even expand, these businesses come from? The answer is the rich. Labour views the rich as some sort of inexhaustible bucket of wealth that will just sit there allowing all its money to be drained out of it. Of course, the rich would not just sit there and allow all of their assets in the UK to be drained away by ridiculous taxation rates. Labour wants to increase the corporate tax rate from 19% to 26% (21% for low-profit organisations). This would mean that businesses would see less incentive to invest in the UK. The more negative incentives for investment in a country, the less investment there will be. The drain on the economy would be incredible, as not only planned future investments but additionally money that is already invested into the country’s businesses is pulled out. I do not need to exaggerate the impact of this on the economy. Already, almost 50% of the wealth that is pulled out of the UK is pulled out due to the possibility of a Labour Party government.

However, although this system is far from acceptable, there is also another extreme which we must strive to avoid. This other extreme is what was experienced in the past. A system where a wealthy elite possessed complete control over everything within their estate, and had powers to the extent that they could treat other humans as objects. A system under which the poorest starved in the streets, whilst the rich ate to excess, a system where the serfs toiled in the fields all day whilst the wealthy ate the toil of their labour. This, without a doubt, is a severely suboptimal system in itself. What, say, should be done when a ridiculously rich but stupid landlord has a serf under him who started at the bottom of society in life, with little money, but incredibly sharp wits? Although the landlord and serf should really swap positions for the greater good of the economy, no such transition would conceivably take place in the system, for the simple reason that the landlord was born with the money, and the serf without. Luckily, no party suggesting such things today ever has, does or will gain enough votes to ever possibly become a largely popular party, but if such parties existed, its policies would certainly include:

1. Legalisation of serfdom
2. Removal of inheritance taxes
3. Inverting the current tax model – instead of taxing the richest the most and the poorest the least, the model would be turned on its head, that is, taxing the rich the least and the poor the most.

Each and all of these policies prevent the poorest members of society from rising upwards, and allow one successful person in a family to ensure family wealth for generations to come.

What then, is the optimal economic system? One which stamps on the successful ones, or one that makes it so that no poor man can ever have a chance at becoming successful? What is required is a middle ground. The optimal economic system then, surely is Loddhism. Loddhism proposes, essentially this: from each to his own wants to each to his own productivity. All should be treated equal at birth, but then, more funds will be allocated towards the education of those who are especially talented, and those who have the potential to do well in specialised jobs. Of course, this would entail a complete nationalisation of the educational system, in order to ensure that all children will have an equal opportunity at the start of their lives.

Businesses would be best left unchanged, except in cases of flagrant misuse of their powers over the habits of the country. The securing of the success of large businesses equates to the success of the economy. The large businesses are so integral to today's society that their removal would lead to a complete collapse of society overnight. However, The Labour Party believes that these large, multi-billion-dollar corporations would be replaced by a plethora of smaller businesses, which would be heavily regulated in order to prevent them from growing into larger businesses. The Labour Party aims to punish successful people who have worked hard to earn their money.

The one exception to this is to make sure that the work of businesses is never complete. However, instead of pulling big businesses backwards, we would create new ones through extensive government subsidisation programmes and funding grants to talented entrepreneurs who are simply attempting to start a business. The old, large businesses would then have to actively work hard in order to keep themselves ahead constantly. *The main reason for large amounts of innovation in any fields are usually money and competition.* Large businesses today that can reasonably claim to be the masters of their fields have reached the point today where they are so large that they can simply buy any competition. The money is there, and, due to stringent anti-monopoly laws some semblance of competition to those who have achieved almost complete dominance in their fields is in existence, but this is a system based on weakening the giants whom have spent decades achieving their place in the economy, rather than strengthening the potential future giants.

All individuals at the time of their birth would be treated equally by the newly nationalised educational system, up until around the age of six. From then on, those who show slightly more talent (scoring higher in tests, holding more intelligent conversations, writing more eloquent essays, and proving that they can be responsible) would be given slightly harder work than those who are less capable. This would gradually progress in this way up until the point of graduation from universities. Of course, pupils who progress in a subject more slowly than others at first, but then catch up and even exceed their peers later on would be allowed to progress onto harder curriculums throughout their time in the educational system.

However, there are those in the Labour Party that say that their policies are simply in place to combat the wealthy landlord who has had his riverside mansion for decades, and is waited on by a plethora of servants. However, in this day and age, those who have inherited their wealth to become rich are severely outnumbered by those such as Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, who simply worked hard for their wealth in adulthood.

This of course, if followed without exceptions, would be intolerably inhumane to the mentally and physically disabled, who are simply unable to generate income. Naturally, exceptions would be made for them. The minimal standard of living in a Loddhist system would be a roof over your head, adequate clothing, a steady supply of food, and a reasonable amount of extra money for leisure and the like. This standard of living would be guaranteed to all people, no matter who they are, regardless of their race, criminal record, or any other such distinguishing characteristics.

There would, in a Loddhist system, be no limits on migration, *in an ideal situation*. The migrants are a source of talent, and additional potential generators of economic produce that are to be welcomed. As always, there will be some exceptions. If a foreign country is attempting to infiltrate a country with a network of spies, or there are simply too many incoming migrants for a country to support. Of course, in this case, a Loddhist government would have to take a wide variety of factors, such as the likelihood of terrorist actions, the qualifications, and even if the individual has come from a country that is not currently at peace with said Loddhist nation. The overall policies on migration to be adopted by a Loddhist country would be:

*As many refugees as possible whilst creating the least amount of disruption to the people.*

The overall aims of Loddhism are to create separate classes, but with as high a potential for class mobility as possible. The person born into a wealthy family could, if overly complacent, find himself at the bottom of society as quickly as anyone else who were born into a family with any amount of material wealth, and the person born into an impoverished family could rise up to the top as easily as anyone else.

The Loddhist manifesto, in essence, can be summed up in one sentence.

stocks,"The 5 stocks I would pick if I was a Hedge Fund Manager (Purely fun discussion, no stock positions in these companies)","My 5 stocks choices with competitive advantages are:

1. Union Pacific Corp. (NYSE: UNP) -Their railroad networks dominate California to Chicago, all the way up to Canada then as far south as Mexico. Even with self driving technology, your self driving truck can't compete with a 200 long cargo train charging 100s of dollars a container. Rail is cheaper, fast, and eco friendly way of transport that reaches areas that may be inaccessible for trucks or not cost effective (Think transporting recycled steel).
2. Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) -Manufacturing military gear such as aircraft is very lucrative especially when you have an unaccounted for USA military industrial complex spending. With potential conflicts in so many nations, what could go wrong buying this stock?
3. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) - Doctors are expensive sometimes costing upwards of 1 million a year to pay, insure, and other costs. All a robot needs is maintenance, a technician (almost always cheaper), electricity, hardware and software then you are good to go. Since healthcare is a fortune to pay for, and robots are typically significantly cheaper, developing automation is the smart thing to do.
4. Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) - The world isn't any closer to a trash less society, this is a simple business model perfect for mega companies. The moat around US trash collection is how regulations on local, state, and federal levels make it a very hard business to get into which costs usually millions just to have dominion over one area. Republic Services is in 41 states and although is 2nd place to Waste Management, offers more growth potential due to Waste Management already being top dog. In addition Republic Service can profit off of trash collection via recycling.
5. Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) -Being an artisan company usually making $10 off something that is likely less than $1 to make is a lucrative business. Especially when your brand is worth billions and associated with middle class and up clientele. Starbucks is like the Disney of coffee, they sell the romance of coffee shops with a well proven and established formula. Considering coffee is just as addictive as any other normal thing like soda, it's no surprise to recommend Starbucks stock. I doubt most Starbucks drinkers are going to go cold turkey anytime soon with coffee.

personalfinance,Is it worth refinancing a home loan after a 50% increase in income?,"I just got a house for $205k with a $50k salary in April. My interest rate is 4.25% but overall my payments are now less than I would be paying for any apartment in the area. 

My loan came with loan insurance because I only had $20k to put down, and $10k of it had to be used for expenses outside of the down payment, bringing my final down payment to just 5%. Because of this, I pay mortgage insurance fees of $200 monthly. 

My income is now $70k with yearly bonuses of 10%. I am approaching $10k in savings and want to start paying mortgage more aggressively.

personalfinance,Student with 401(a) account from former employer losing money,"Hello!

I am a medical student looking to reinvest funds from a 401(a) account with AIG I had while working for a large state university for a short time before starting medical school school. I currently have modest $1500 in the account, but after reading some books and being more proactive about my finances I reviewed the recent statements for the 401a account and realized that I am losing money because of the fees that AIG is charging me. Because I am a student and have a lot of student debt (still in deferment because of school until graduation in May 2021), I would like to mitigate my losses and transfer that money to an account with zero or minimal fees. How can I go about doing this? 

I have no credit card debt and do have a personal investment account with Wealthfront that I opened up a year or two ago. Can I roll the 401a money from AIG into my low fee Wealthfront account, or would I have to open an IRA? Am I eligible to open an IRA or any other type of account as a student who has no income other than federal student loans?

Sorry if this is an incredibly beginner question; I'm still in the process of researching this and scanning the archives for clues but any info would be greatly appreciated!

Sincerely,

personalfinance,Payoff goals: which loan to tackle first?,"I'm in my 40s and in good financial shape. Excellent credit, homeowner, with no credit card debt.

Other than mortgages, my debt is in the form of a student loan and an auto loan. I want to set a goal to pay one of them off in the next year. Here are the figures:

**Student loan**

* Balance: $23,261
* Payment: $386
* Interest rate: 5.365%
* Maturity: Aug 2025

**Auto loan**

* Balance: $26,578
* Payment: $588
* Interest rate: 3.89%
* Maturity: Oct 2023

There's a tax benefit (of unclear value) to keeping the student loan, but the interest rate is higher... and it's over a longer term. They're close enough that it might be a wash, but I wanted to see if Reddit can offer some advice. Which one should I put extra payments toward?

EDIT: I realized thanks to a Redditor below that I don't even qualify for a student loan interest tax deduction... so there's no benefit to keeping it.",finance

personalfinance,Minimum Loan Payment Will Not Payoff Loan in Time?,"Hey everyone, hopefully you all can help clear something up for me. My current student loan is a fixed 20 year loan, 5.29%, 140k, and minimum payment of $856. I'm thinking of refinancing to a 15 year loan because I've taken a decent chunk out of my loan, I'm already on pace for that time, and the current low interest rates means I can maintain a similar minimum payment and cut .75% off my interest.  
This is all well and good but I was looking at my current loan and based on various calculators I found online my minimum monthly payment should have been about $950. As it stands now, my payment of $856 would take 24 years.  
So here are my questions. First, am I looking at this correctly? Second, can my student loan provider give me the wrong minimum payment in order drag out my loan for longer? I currently pay way more than my minimum so I'm not necessarily worried about that. It just seems very shady and messed up to me. Just wondering if anybody has any insights to this.",finance

I'm looking to refi and confused about FHA loans. I understand the premise of an FHA loan when it comes to new mortgages, but a little confused with refis. My house has appreciate since purchased and my balance left on my loan is approximately 75%. My confusion is, will I be cleared from mortgage insurance if I refi to an FHA loan? It isn't 100% clear on if I will have to pay mortgage insurance on an FHA loan regardless of my loan-to-value ratio. 

Additionally, are there any hidden limitations if I get an FHA loan (could it be difficult to get equity out of my loan, more difficult to refi, less impactful on my credit score, etc.)?

I have excellent credit and just started shopping around for a refi and ran into this question. I can qualify for a conventional loan, but I saw a better interest rate and fees (if mortgage insurance is not applied) to an FHA loan. Am I potentially limiting myself if I get an FHA loan instead of a conventional loan?",finance

personalfinance,received prequal'd refi offer w/ 3.125% (3.43 APR) - legit rate?,"Hello, I watch this subreddit regularly, never posted though.

got an interesting offer from Nations Lending in the mail and I am wondering if this is legit, if so I would look further into it to consider if the refi makes sense.

We have been in our current home 2.5yrs, plan to be here for the next 10+

currently financed at 4.125% with unpaid principal of 246K. total principal+interest comes to 1288. based on the % from the offer i am looking at almost $200 monthly savings. PLUS i think with refi getting an appraisal will remove my nearly $100 pmi. Their offer is 3.125% (3.43APR) / 30yrs

so my primary question is (if i am looking at this right): is Nations Lending accurate in this interest %? it seems low compared to other numbers i have seen recently.

Edit: I understand pre-qual has no guarantees, but mainly im wondering whether I want to pursue this based on interest rate given. I generally have no issue getting approved. + updated to show 30yr term on offer",finance

investing,WeWork chases new financing as cash crunch looms,"[https://www.ft.com/content/f29ecc58-eba9-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55](https://www.ft.com/content/f29ecc58-eba9-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55)

WeWork’s bankers are scrambling to complete a new debt financing package as soon as next week to buy time to restructure after the company’s failed initial public offering left it running short of cash at a faster rate than expected.

Two people briefed on the fundraising efforts said the office company’s cash crunch was so acute that it had to raise new financing no later than the end of November. Fitch Ratings downgraded WeWork’s credit rating last week to CCC+, warning that the lossmaking company’s liquidity position was “precarious”.

JPMorgan Chase, the Wall Street bank that had led the office company’s IPO preparations, is leading the financing negotiations and considering a contribution to the new package, several people familiar with the matter said.

The debt will come at a considerably higher cost to WeWork than it paid for its previous loans, reflecting the abrupt change of fortunes for what was until a few weeks ago one of the world’s most highly valued private companies.

SoftBank, Masayoshi Son’s Japanese telecoms and technology group, had previously agreed to inject $1.5bn into WeWork next April and a further $200m in the second half of next year.

It is now considering amending that agreement to put in the money it had committed at a sharply reduced valuation from the $47bn price tag it placed on WeWork when it last invested in January.

It is also in talks to add new funding that could raise its part of the fundraising package to about $2.5bn and bring its total investment in WeWork to about $11.5bn, people familiar with the discussions said.

They cautioned, however, that negotiations were still fluid and that the talks about new SoftBank funding and other elements of the debt package could still fall apart.

JPMorgan is trying to get other major banks to participate, said people familiar with its efforts to put together the emergency financing package.

Goldman Sachs, one of WeWork’s investors, advisers and customers, had been among a consortium of banks willing to lend $6bn had the IPO succeeded but has so far sat out the new financing discussions out of concern about the level of uncertainty surrounding the company, one person said.

WeWork, SoftBank, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

WeWork has been burning through the cash it raised in the private market. The failure of the IPO deprived it of $3bn-$4bn it hoped to raise from issuing new equity and the $6bn loan package its bankers had offered subject to it completing a successful float.

Institutional investors rejected both the valuation WeWork sought, making clear that no IPO would price it above a $15bn-$20bn range, and the company’s labyrinthine governance arrangements.

Since WeWork pulled the IPO, Adam Neumann, the co-founder who had taken about $700m out of the company before trying to bring it to market, has agreed to cede his position as chief executive and to strip his shares of some of their voting power.

Fitch estimates WeWork’s current funding arrangements might only carry it through another four to eight quarters unless it rapidly reduced the rate at which it has been burning cash.

WeWork’s bonds have tumbled since signs emerged that its IPO was in trouble, and were trading below 82 cents on the dollar on Thursday. The yield on the bonds has leapt from 6.8 per cent to 12.5 per cent since August.

WeWork’s losses have climbed as fast as its revenues: it lost about $1.9bn in 2018 on sales of $1.8bn. Fitch estimated the company had less than $1.5bn in unrestricted cash at the end of the third quarter, and warned that it faced “material restructuring cash charges” as it lays off several thousand of its 12,500 employees.

Co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham have pushed some of Mr Neumann’s acolytes out of the company and reined in its signing of new leases.

In an interview this week with Nikkei Business magazine, Mr Son did not address WeWork directly but said he was “embarrassed” by his failings. The biggest of them, he said, was when he attempted to compete against NTT in broadband and watched SoftBank’s valuation plunge as the dotcom bubble burst.

“Compared with those days, the small crises that pop up here and there today are mere child’s play,” he said.

This article has been corrected to say that Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham are co-CEOs, rather than co-chairs",finance

personalfinance,Wife had a student loan that was not due till 2021. This morning she got that her credit score dropped 220 points for this loan being delinquent. What can we do?,"**UPDATE as of Friday Afternoon**

Thank you mostly to everyone who responded. Most of you were a little rude and didn't fully read and then downvoted all my responses.

Here's what happened:

This was my wife's second bachelor's degree and she graduated in summer 2018. Her due date for loans she was given was 2021 and as of last month, that was still the case. When she graduated, this was the case and she called and confirmed and they did confirm that nothing was due until 2021. She checked monthly and it still stated that was the case. It also wasn't 0%, it's a 5% loan. I was thinking it was 0% because we were planning on paying it in full before the payment due date of 2021, thus not paying interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

What happened was that since it was her second bachelor's, she only attended for two years, but the university put her graduation date as two years later thinking she had two more years. My wife called the university to explain this and they still insisted the due date was 2021. As of September, the Perkins loan portal still showed it wasnt due till 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

We called the loan company and they said that at some point, they sent a notice three months ago that there would be a change, however we never received it because... they had messed up our address. So we never received a notice and online it didn't show a change. This company seems to have an issue with this sort of thing, so it's not surprising. They said that they would eliminate the late charges and that on the next report, they'll report that it's been fixed and that should help the credit score... but that's where my question lies... is that enough to fix the credit score ding. She had a 780 and now it's a 560 and we're trying to buy a home next year.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: I was correct in what I stated. The loan company messed up and are doing what they can to fix it. Reading is fundamental gentlemen.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**OG POST**

That's basically it. My wife graduated in summer 2018 and we paid off all loans except the last $3k since the school said nothing was due until 2021. She called and made sure this was the case and it stated the same when logged into her school/loan portal.

&amp;#x200B;

So today she received some alert that her credit score dropped from 780 to 550 because of a delinquent payment on this loan so at the end of the day today I need to look through everything with her and jump on the phone. What is my recourse here? It was clearly stated that the first payment was not due until 2021, verified by their website and over the phone. There's nothing in the mail that indicated anything changed.

&amp;#x200B;

What can we do to get this taken off her record?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for everyone's input. I think I explained a little incorrectly  but my understanding was that it was 0% and no payments required until 2021 and I do understand the difference. I've got a great credit score as does my wife and we always pay everything off ASAP. In this case it was really odd when she told me this, but I heard her on the phone with the rep at the university (some sort of loan through the university whereas other loans were from the Feds)and confirmed zero needed to be paid. She wont be home from work, so once she gets home I'll be able to dig in more and see if she simply misunderstood. That could be the case but I do remember looking at the website and hearing her on the phone and it sounded like nothing was due until then.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll update this once I found out and thank you everyone for your input.",finance

With the exception of BRK.B, I will list dividend paying stocks that I believe can continue paying a growing dividend until their stock price recovers.

**BRK.B**  has trailed SPY for most of the this bull market and that's understandably upset some investors. I think a big part of it is because [a lot of companies have been aggressive with buybacks](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/29/buybacks-companies-increasingly-using-debt-to-repurchase-stocks.html) while BRK.B is extremely conservative when it comes to repurchasing shares (they only just recently started buying back small chunks). Their KHC stake hasn't panned out well so far. They've got huge positions in financials which have trailed the broader market (maybe a case can be made for them being undervalued?) However, their operating businesses and dividends from the stock portfolio have been piling cash into their war chest which helps them broker deals like [this](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-occidental-anadarko-chevron-51556635264). It's only a matter of when (not if), the next recession comes along Buffet and Munger (or their management team if they are no more) deploy that cash for other favorable deals.

**MO** [is ranked as one of the best performing stocks of all time](https://www.thebalance.com/best-industries-stocks-357211) because it goes through extended periods of undervaluation which allows dividends to pick up shares at dirt cheap prices. MO has been beaten down because of declining cigarette volumes and because [it appears they overpaid for JUUL](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/09/altrias-chance-of-writing-down-juul-stake-increased-materially-analysts-say.html). If you take out the BUD stake and assign a value of $0 to their JUUL and CRON stakes, their legacy tobacco business (cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars), trades for a FCF yield of over 11%. The dividend is safe and will continue to grow, but I don't expect the stock price to recover until JUUL starts to contribute to their FCF and cig volume declines stabilize. What they lack in geographic diversity, they more than make up in the diversity of their investments and businesses.

**BTI** has been beaten down for similar reasons. Shortly after they took over RAI (after taking on significant debt) in 2017, the US cig market started showing accelerated volume declines. They are also the dominant player in menthol cigarettes in the US, which makes them more vulnerable than Altria to a menthol ban. That being said, at its current price, they generate around $10 billion in FCF which amounts to a FCF yield of 12.5%. About 60% of that is paid in dividends, while the rest can goes towards debt reduction. They are the second largest tobacco company after PM and often hold a dominant position in certain developing economies (They own roughly 30% of ITC, Indian Tobacco Company which runs a cigarette monopoly in India). [Their most recent earnings report showed a strong underlying business that's also poised for growth.](https://www.bat.com/group/sites/uk__9d9kcy.nsf/vwPagesWebLive/DO6FKEVZ/$FILE/medMDBFXLUP.pdf?openelement) They are also well diversified in terms of product offerings (cigs, smokeless tobacco, vapes and heat not burn)

**PM** while not as cheap as the other two, it earns a  premium because of the Marlboro brand and their lack of exposure to the US in the cigarette market. The stock initially dropped last year because IQOS showed slowing growth. When talks of a merger with Altria surfaced, the stock dropped some more. However, the talks are now off and  [their most recent earnings report indicates that IQOS](https://philipmorrisinternational.gcs-web.com/static-files/e8bcf906-8865-4e8a-8aaf-00fbba222aeb) sales have picked up again. The company has been hurt by a strong USD, but their underlying business has shown currency neutral earnings growth that's 8-10% which shows the strength of their business. As IQOS has now been approved for sale in the US by the FDA, it should alleviate their currency issues a bit. Not to mention, any future weakness in the USD will benefit PM. The stock currently has a 6% dividend yield that is safe. [This is a slightly dated post, but still mostly relevant for BTI and PM today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13yn9c/smoke_if_you_got_em_why_you_should_own_pm_and_bti/)

**XOM** is sporting a dividend yield of over 5% (the largest it's been in 20 years). The oil and gas industry as a whole has suffered over the last decade from two oil crashes and growing concerns about climate change. XOM has also had issues with meeting their production goals the last few years. That being said, they are one of the best run companies in the oil and gas sector. They have paid a growing dividend for 35 years and despite two oil crashes in the last decade, they have managed to grow their dividend 6% annually while still maintaining the best balance sheet in the industry (many other either froze or cut their dividend). They have been selling off old assets to invest in growth and are confident they can double their earnings by 2025 assuming oil is $60 a barrel. [Here's an informative post about investing in Oil by Joshua Kennon](https://www.joshuakennon.com/lets-talk-about-investing-in-oil-stocks-and-the-oil-majors/). Also, here's a [really good book](https://www.amazon.com/Private-Empire-ExxonMobil-American-Power-ebook/dp/B0064W5BPM) that talks about the amount of political power the company has in the US and abroad. The stock price will fluctuate with the price of oil, but the dividend will continue to grow.

**WFC** used to be considered one of the best large banks in the US until the fraudulent accounts scandal surfaced a few years ago. The fed has imposed an asset cap which has causing the bank to miss out on a strong economy. The stock will likely trade sideways until the asset cap is lifted, but until then, the bank plans on rewarding shareholders  [with dividends and buybacks.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/07/05/feds-growth-restrictions-force-wells-fargo-to-loosen-its-purse-strings-for-investors-yet-again/#3b6fd6ed21e2) They pan on buying back 10% of all outstanding shares over the course of a year in addition to a 4% dividend. This will supercharge returns when the asset cap is lifted and WFC can make more loans again. Also, WFC and USB are less susceptible to interest rates as they earn a significant chunk of their revenues in fees, unlike their peers. It's currently trading at a P/B of 1.2. The dividend is safe and will continue to grow at 10% or so. With a starting yield of 4%, it makes for a good entry point.

**ABBV, BMY and PFE** are some stocks in the pharma sector that deserve some notice, but I haven't looked into them much. The uncertainty around these stocks revolve around expiring patents/pipeline concerns and leverage taken on for mergers. Pharma stocks like oil can be volatile but can provide tremendous returns over the long run. With consumer staples and tobacco, [pharmaceuticals have been one of the best performing industries (all three of these stocks are on the original list)](https://www.thebalance.com/best-industries-stocks-357211).

Nothing is guaranteed, but I feel like at these prices, there is a decent margin of safety in these stocks. Hopefully a few of them pay off moving forward. What are some of your picks?",finance

personalfinance,Just wanted to reiterate the actual cost of buying a mobile home (inspired by the trending post of buying one),"Mobile homes are a very poor financial investment for the reasons below, which I've copied and pasted from the original post about mobile homes. I also work for a Mobile Home Lender. 

""Most lenders will not finance a mobile home, so you'll be limited to very few lenders, therefore you'll be stuck with a subpar interest rate due to the risk. Anywhere from 6-10% (yes it's that high). You'll pay 125%+ the cost of the home in just interest alone, AND will be stuck with a relatively high principal/interest payment for what you're getting.

A quick run of the numbers: a 100,000 mobile home @ 8% APR for 30 years will get you a monthly payment of 733.76. That same house  @ 3% is 421.60 NOT counting insurance and property taxes. That 5% difference in rate is a 312.16 dollar difference on payment, AND a total interest savings of 112,377.60 over 30 years.

But how much house could you buy with a 733.76 monthly pmt? A $174,041 house at 3%. That is incredibly significant. You're essentially buying more house while paying significantly less interest, too.

And from strictly an investment perspective, absolutely not either. Mobile homes depreciate drastically. A 30 year mobile home might not even fetch 20k. So you've paid a total of $264,153.60 total for a $100,000 principal at 8% tied to a home valued at $20,000 when it's all said and done. It's a lose lose situation for the buyer""

To reiterate this, here's a other real life example: I'm currently at work, viewing a contract for a mobile home. The APR is 10% at a 360 month term. The amount financed is roughly 40,000. The finance charge is more than double, at a whopping 86,000. Basically you're paying 86,000 extra to buy a 40,000 home, that depreciates in value. You're home will barely be worth 5,000 in 30 years.

I encourage everyone on this sub to seriously weigh the costs of buying a mobile home. Unless you own property yourself and can afford a MODULAR home, you do not need to buy one. You would be better off renting if I'm being completely honest.",finance

I have not worked this year. All my income is from alimony.

I have $33,835 in a money market account that earns like 1.6% in interest per month. I CANNOT use this money at all because I used it and the alimony statement as proof of my income for my landlord so that I can rent my current apartment.

I am a part time community college student and I have also been through two different dental surgeries this year.

I get my medical insurance through the ACA and my dental insurance through COBRA.

I don't know if any of these factors will influence my taxes.

On July 30 of this year 2019, I paid the IRS $2000.

I visited a tax person last week who told me I should pay $2000 to the government BEFORE Jan 15th. $1000 to the federal government and $1000 to my state government in order to avoid underpayment penalty.

What complicates matters is that I have $2000 in credit card debt. The interest rate on that debt is 1.99% that lasts till April 2020.

I have to make a payment on this card next week.

My FICO score is 700-something.

So how should I break down the payments to the IRS vs the credit card company?

He passed in March 2019
His only form of income was Social Security Disability and a relatively small 401k that he cashed out in 2018.
The balance in the 401k was $11829.15, and $2365.83 was withheld for Federal Income tax.  I thought that there was not a tax penalty for cashing out early.

Question #1
Is federal tax supposed to be withheld when a 401k is cashed out early by someone on disability?

Question #2
If the answer to #1 is, “no,” do I need to file a federal tax return on his behalf?

Question #3
If I do need to file a federal tax return on his behalf, would I also need to file a state return?

EDIT:  Afterthought, I was thinking about the Penalty for early withdrawal. 
There is no financial penalty for early withdrawal of 401k when on disability.  
Obviously, still need to pay the taxes.

Any other reason I would need to file a tax return on his behalf?

Tuition for the entire program is expected to cost somewhere between 130k to 150k, depending on the school, with Boston-level cost of living.

I have never taken out a loan before so I have no idea how loans work, and have excellent credit (~811). Undergrad was paid for completely, but I am paying for grad school on my own. My main question for this post is whether I should pay for grad school completely with loans or if I should withdraw some portion of my IRA in order to take out less in loans? I'm 30 so I have plenty of life/career left to go. I am single and won't have a family anytime soon and am pretty much only responsible for myself. I'm also planning to apply to some scholarships here and there, but I'm confident that whatever amount I might get in scholarships will be trivial. I plan on/hope to work in a loan-forgiveness program for medical providers after graduating. I don't know if this is important, but I live in MA now but most likely will end up moving after graduating.

I am aware of state and federal taxes being imposed on my withdrawal, and I believe that since I'd be withdrawing for higher education purposes, this makes me exempt from the early withdrawal penalty. But I'm still unsure if that means I should go ahead and use the retirement money or save it regardless.

I said above it's a traditional IRA, but am not 100% certain about this? I mean, I looked up the difference and I know that you can make contributions to a traditional IRA for tax deductions now and pay tax withdrawals later and this is exactly what I do (I make contributions to my IRA every tax season to get more back in my taxes), so that's why I'm pretty sure it's a traditional IRA.

I've been out of school for 6 years now and have largely relied on Income-Driven repayment plans since my income has been somewhat low to unemployed on and off. I've just started a new job with a great salary though — which is awesome! — but that also means my Graduated payment for my largest chunk of federal loans is going to be insanely high. My goal right now is essentially to find a way to lower my monthly payments. Yes I know in the long term that may not be smart but I rather pay manageable payments now for a 15 or 20 year term rather than extremely high ones for 10 years.

I figure my options are: 1) Consolidate my federal and keep my private as is (that payment is manageable for me, but it has the highest interest rate). And  I'd still have the federal benefit of Income-Driven plans in the future (ie if I get laid off worst case). Or 2) I refinance both federal and private.

I've done some research online but don't have much knowledge or anyone to help me figure this out, so looking for any advice I can get here. Another concern re refinancing is that I work in an industry where layoffs are fairly frequent, and given my history of using income-driven plans, I'm hesitant to refinance if say a year or two I end up screwed and stuck with a huge loan I can't pay. Which is the best option given my goals? And for anyone suggesting refinance, do you recommend one lender over another (SoFi vs Earnest, etc). Thanks!!

personalfinance,Calculating the Payback Time on a Student Loan,"Hello. I've recently landed a good job and will be on my own soon, so I expect to find myself here a lot. Today's post is more of a math question than anything. But first some background...

I've heard it's a good idea to make minimum payments on low-interest student loans and to knock out the high-interest loans as quickly as possible. I've been deferring repayment for quite some time, and the total balance on my high-interest loan is $35,878.02. The annual rate is currently 8.5%. In order to pay it off asap, I will be making payments of $1000 each month. 


I used the following formula:

A=(Pr*(1+r)^(n))/((1+r)^(n)-1)

where A is the amount paid per payment, P is the initial principal (which, for my purposes, is the total balance on the loan), r is the interest rate per payment period, and n is the total number of payments

If I did my algebra correctly, solving for n gives:

n=ln(A/(A-Pr))/ln(1+r)

Now, I plugged in A=1000, P=35,878.02, and r=.085/12 (since I'll be making monthly payments and there are 12 months in a year). I got that the loan should be paid off in roughly 41.54 months. Maybe a kind, math-loving soul could check my work here, but I'm pretty sure it's right. 

Here's the thing: Interest on student loans is compounded daily. If I rerun the formula after converting A and r to a daily basis, I get almost the same number as before. But in reality, I'll be making payments only every 30.44 days on average, and interest will be accumulating between payments. 

Basically, I'm not sure if the formula I used can be applied to situations wherein the interest is compounded daily while payments are made monthly. I feel like I may have a fundamental misunderstanding of how the formula works, but maybe I just need to find a more applicable formula. Not quite sure. 

Any insight at all would be greatly appreciated, and thank you in advance! Also, here's where I got the formula: https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelArticles/amortization-calculation.html",finance

He confirmed I had a $0 balance and said he would send a paid in full letter. I asked about the refund and he said he couldn’t get a number of what is owed to me, but he would put in a request. 

Last week I got a paid in full letter, but no refund. Also they’re still garnishing my wages at $100 a week. I didn’t care as much about the garnishment, since it’s saving me money in a sense without me missing it, but I read a thread (it was many years old) that said they won’t give it to you in a lump sum, they’ll give it back the same way it came, so like $100 per week until it’s all back. If that’s the case, I want it to end now! 

How do I proceed? Do I just wait and hope the student loan people send me a check? Or do I go to my employer and show them a paid in full letter? I was hoping not to have to go to HR about it, and the fed student loan people would just contact them and tel them to stop.

All my funds were converted into ETC and withdrawn from binance. I received no confirmation mail for withdrawals too. All security steps - login password, 2FA, confirmation mail were compromised. The ETC address to which he withdrew happened to be my Bittrex account address. In Bittrex exchange, The perpetrator has converted all ETC into ETH and withdrawn from there as well to ETH address 0x624577Cc87b52296de9F0E33AaFd6B24e1767B83. 
From there he has moved it again to a Cryptonator wallet 0x4FED1fC4144c223aE3C1553be203cDFcbD38C581.

This final address has around 738 ETH. Sure a hacker whale. Even few seconds before transactions have happened on this address. But couldn't do anything 😳 Anonymity can be a curse as well!

 I believe my phone has been compromised.. But I don't have a clue even now how. I use iphone and access binance only through safari. And it's been more than a year since I logged into my Bittrex account. So not sure how the hacker got access to my Bittrex account as well.

I found a year old reddit thread, [exodus wallet hack](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9ytxsa/can_someone_please_help_me_i_logged_into_my/), where exodus wallet was hacked and ETH was moved to same ETH address. So this hacker has been doing it for a long long time. Can anyone do anything on this. There are around 800k transactions on this address.

personalfinance,Would like to pay of Credit Card Debt. Questions,"My first post in this sub. 

Just a little background: \[Sorry if too many details\] I work Part Time and bring in $1700 per month (I just got a raise). I am not responsible for many bills (my husband pays for most of them- but has made clear that my debt is MY debt and he will not be helping out with that- which I think is SO fair). I buy the groceries, which I have pared down to $500 per month (cant really take it lower than that in the area I live.) I just got a car loan from my credit union for a 2019 Nissan versa for $10, 579 (including GAP) @ 5.89 percent. My car payment is $250 every month, I have been paying $350 a month to get a jump on things. Gas for that car is cheap and I pay about $40 per month on that. I have been paying $600 a month towards my Credit Card debt. I have an Ally Cashback Credit Card a@ 24.99 interest rate \[Yikes, I know\] with a balance of $250 \[will be paid off within the next pay period\] and an Amazon Chase Rewards card with a balance of $2650 and interest of 23.99 \[It's depressing how bad my credit was when I got these cards- It is steadily improving though\]. I have already asked for lower interest rates and been denied. I have no savings- I just started putting away $60 a month and plan to increase this obviously once debt is paid. I realize this is not CRIPPLING debt, but it has been giving me anxiety that I am a 30 year old woman with NO SAVINGS that is completely financially dependent on my husband. I am ashamed of my financial situation and find it depressing.  I thought about doing a balance transfer to avoid interest, but I don't know if it's worth it as I would like to pay this debt off by February and want to just get through that.  I have been trying to curb spending- I've had a few emergencies come up. 

\[By the way,  my husband has no DEBT, reasonable savings, and is fantastic with a budget. He works hard, saves hard, and is, without really calling himself this, a true minimalist. I want to be more like him. He's frustrated with the debt, because I went behind his back and got myself into this mess, so he wants me to figure it out on my own. Probably for the best. I also feel ashamed because as a married working woman, I make enough to contribute more to my household expenses, but debt is preventing me from doing so.\]

2. Should I balance transfer my card debt to a 0 APR personal loan or card? What are the pros and cons? Is there potential for more debt? 
3. Should I just pay the minimum on the car payment until the credit card debt is paid? Is my car interest rate high? 
4. Should I stop putting that $60 away per month in savings (so pathetically small) until the debt is paid off?

personalfinance,"23 years old - Finishing first year after college with $23,000 in Woodforest savings account. Best place to put my money?","Hi all,

I have about $26,000 in student loan debt. The average interest rate on my loans is 4.27%, which is a moderate interest rate according to the personal finance spending flowchart. 

I typically save about $1,600 each month (not including contributions to my 401k). 

I currently pay $300 on my loans every month (which is just a few dollars beyond the minimum payment). I am considering increasing this amount to $500/month in 2020, which leaves me with $1,400 in savings each month assuming I receive no raises. 

I currently contribute 4% of my gross income to a 401k offered by my employer. The company matches contributions up to 4% after 3 years of employment.

My financial values:

-Having relatively large amounts of very liquid assets. I find having $20,000 in my savings account soothing because I feel like I have the freedom to do anything with it I want or need at a moment’s notice. As anecdotal support, I had to spend $1,000 in July on car repairs which wouldn’t have been possible if 100% of my savings were going towards my student loans or tied up in an investment account. 

-Taking advantage of the time value of money. I understand that having my money in an account that earns me less than a quarter in interest each month isn’t helping me long term, especially when I factor in the interest accrual on my loans.

-Having control over my money. I feel a little uneasy about my employer-sponsored 401k because it feels a little too far removed from my control. I will continue to contribute to it due to the match. However, I am interested in opening a Roth IRA directly through a financial institution.

-I also like the idea of having my money associated with a brick-and-mortar institution within driving distance of me, which is why I haven’t abandoned my Woodforest account. It would also be nice to have my money at an institution with a variety of savings and investment accounts so that I don’t have to transfer funds between different institutions. 

How do you suggest I divide my savings going forward? Should I increase my loan payments? Should I get a high yield savings account? How much should I contribute, if any, to a Roth IRA? Should I be considering another kind of investment? What bank do you recommend? Any input really is welcome. 

Thanks in advance!",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 14th, 2019.

# **Profits expected to fall as earnings season kicks off in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/11/profits-expected-to-fall-as-earnings-season-kicks-off-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The third-quarter earnings season kicks off in the coming week, and it is likely to expose how much the trade war has cost companies’ bottom lines.
*****
&gt; First out of the gate are major banks and financial companies, with J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs reporting Tuesday. But by the end of the week, a smattering of industrial, tech, transportation and consumer names will have reported, including Alcoa and Honeywell. Netflix and IBM report Wednesday, and consumer giant Coca-Cola reports Friday. United Airlines reports Tuesday, and CSX reports Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Besides earnings, some important economic reports are being released, including retail sales on Wednesday and industrial production Thursday.
*****
&gt; Earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are expected to decline by 3.1% for the third quarter, after growing by more than 3% in the second quarter, according to data from Refinitiv. For the second quarter, earnings were also expected to be negative to flat, but results beat lowered expectations.
*****
&gt; “The story of are we going to be negative, or are we not going to be negative, is going to be in focus,” said Patrick Palfrey, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
*****
&gt; Palfrey said margins are being pinched in several areas, including energy, with the decline in oil prices. Oil has been responding more to worries about global growth and trade wars than to geopolitical developments that normally could drive it higher. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 7.5% in the third quarter.
*****
&gt; “We are of the view that companies will likely devote a significant portion of their time talking about the impact of trade tariffs,” Palfrey said. “The goal is to ascertain just how much the decline in earnings is coming from those pressures.”
*****
&gt; The decline in oil prices, in fact, are expected to drag down profits in the energy sector. Earnings for the energy sector are expected to be down 32%, while revenues are expected to fall by 9.5%, according to Credit Suisse. Margins for the sector are expected to contract by 22.7%. Without energy estimates included, S&amp;P profits would be down just 1%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “We think margins are going to subtract 5.9% from EPS growth of the S&amp;P 500,” said Palfrey. He projects earnings overall to decline by 4.2%, and he does not expect the stock market to make much headway during the earnings season.
*****
&gt; “I think we’re moving sideways. The real backstop is the environment, while under pressure, it is nonrecessionary, and that will ultimately prevent the market from materially selling off,” said Palfrey.
*****
&gt; Palflrey said a group he calls “tech plus,” which include tech and communications companies, have taken some of the biggest margin hits this quarter even though revenue growth remains solid. Six of the top 10 companies whose margins impacted S&amp;P earnings growth the most are from that group, including Alphabet , Amazon, Apple, Facebook, IBM and Micron.
*****
&gt; As a group, their margins are expected to contract by 14.8%, compared with 3.6% for all other S&amp;P 500 companies combined.
*****
&gt; ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum are on the list of companies with the biggest margin hits. Exxon for example saw a decline in margins of 34%, and Credit Suisse estimates that pared 0.6% off overall S&amp;P 500 earnings growth. Credit Suisse says the consensus decline in Amazon margins is expected to be 42.5%, denting S&amp;P earnings growth by 0.3%.
*****
&gt; “At least for earnings, it’s a relatively positive backdrop. We should see a little bit of clarity on the whole China trade,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. Hickey said in the past two quarters, stocks did well at the start of the reporting season, but they were then derailed by trade developments in the latter part of the earnings period.
*****
&gt; Palfrey said the market is being held back by several factors, including the slowdown in the manufacturing sector. “I think it’s going to be difficult for the market to move meaningfully higher without an improvement in industrial data and without the yield curve becoming uninverted,” he said.
*****
&gt; ISM manufacturing data has been weakening and has shown a contraction in activity for the past two months.
*****
&gt; The inverted yield curve is a bond market recession warning. When the curve is inverted, shorter duration securities yield more than longer duration securities, meaning investors are demanding a higher yield to hold investments for a much briefer time. In this case, the 3-month Treasury bill was yielding about 11 more basis points than the 10-year note.
*****
&gt; Hickey said there could be some positives in the earnings season, like last quarter. Negative revisions of earnings estimates by analysts are outnumbering positive revisions by about 2 to 1. He noted in the last two quarters, stocks responded well to earnings news in the beginning of the reporting period but then faded when negative headlines on trade in the latter part of each earnings season.
*****
&gt; “Expectations seem pretty low. We’ve had analysts’ downward revisions remain elevated, as they’ve been heading into prior warning seasons. But we haven’t necessarily seen the number of warnings from companies rising,” he said. “It could be a positive divergence that analysts are lowering earnings estimates at a higher-than-average rate, but companies aren’t warning at a higher-than-average rate.”
*****
&gt; Financial companies profits are expected to be up by 1.4%, and real estate is expected to see the best profit growth with a gain of 2.7%, according to Refinitiv. The information technology sector is expected to see a profit decline of 7.6%, and communications is expected to be 1% lower, according to Refinitiv. Materials is expected to see the biggest decline after energy. Sensitive to global growth and manufacturing, the sector’s earnings are expected to fall 11.1%.
*****
&gt; Despite the downbeat expectations for third-quarter earnings, companies may issue more positive outlooks after China and the U.S. announced the first phase of a trade deal.
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were all up more than 1%. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were also up around 1% for the week and snapped a three-week losing streak.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 10/11/19

&gt; It was a disappointing week for US economic data as two-thirds of releases came in weaker than expected or than the prior period. Consumer Credit data for the month of August was the only major release on Monday, exceeding expectations, but declining from July’s level. Inflation data took the spotlight this week with the release of PPI, CPI, and export and import prices. Core CPI was inline with the previous month and the import price index’s decline (year over year) was smaller than forecasted, but other readings on inflation were weaker. Likewise, labor data had its share of disappointments as the JOLTS report showed a third consecutive decline in openings, hourly earnings growth slowed, and continuing claims ticked higher. Initial Jobless Claims provided some relief though, coming in at 210K compared to 220K expected and 219K last week. While small business optimism was weaker—NFIB’s index fell to 101.8 from 103.1—consumer sentiment readings from Bloomberg and the University of Michigan both rose with the latter exceeding expectations.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101119-ECO1.png))**

&gt; Looking ahead to next week, the calendar is slightly busier with 22 releases on the docket in addition to earnings beginning to ramp up as a total of 115 companies report. There are no scheduled economic releases Monday due to Columbus Day, so next week’s data begins on Tuesday with Empire Manufacturing which is forecasted to fall from 2.0 to 0.5. Other manufacturing gauges, including the Philadelphia Fed’s index and industrial production, are also expected to fall. Retail Sales is scheduled for Wednesday and are expected to rise 0.3%. On Thursday, Housing Starts and Permit data are both expected to show moderation. The leading index is scheduled to round out the week on Friday.

&gt; As shown below, the spread between equity fund flows and fixed income fund flows has reached a net reading of -$165.9bn over the last three months; that’s among the largest net flow out of equities and into bonds since the data starts.

# The Most Volatile Stocks on Earnings

&gt; Looking for action? At the start of each earnings season, we publish our list of the most volatile stocks on earnings. Our Earnings Explorer tool contains a huge database that has every single quarterly earnings report for nearly all US-listed stocks going back to 2001. One part of the database tracks the one-day price reaction that stocks experience following their earnings reports, so users are able to easily track how individual stocks typically react to earnings.

&gt; In the table below, we show the stocks expected to report within the next month that have historically been the most volatile in reaction to earnings. To make the list, the company had to have at least 20 quarterly reports (5 years) and also have a current share price of $5 or more.

&gt; At the top of the list is Telecom equipment maker Infinera (INFN), which is scheduled to report on October 28th after the close. INFN just barely makes the cut because it trades at $5.20/share, but it has historically averaged a one-day absolute change of 15.16% on its historical earnings reaction days. You can expect a big move when it reports at the end of this month. Consumer review website YELP ranks as the second most volatile stock on earnings with an average one-day move of +/-14.85%. Enphase Energy (ENPH), LendingTree (TREE), and Applied Opto (AAOI) round out the top five with average one-day moves of more than +/-13% on their earnings reaction days. Other notables towards the top of the list include Wayfair (W), Netflix (NFLX), and Twitter (TWTR), which all typically move either up or down more than 12% on earnings.

&gt; Of the stocks on the list, Enphase (ENPH) is up by far the most in 2019 with a huge gain of 424%. Other stocks like Stamps.com (STMP), ANGI Homeservices (ANGI), and Green Dot (GDOT) are down more than 50% YTD. Twitter (TWTR), Blucora (BCOR), and Benefitfocus (BNFT) have the highest earnings beat rates at more than 90%. While it has a high beat rate, BNFT has been on a wild ride over the past two years, rallying from $24 up to $60 in 2018 before falling all the way back down to $24 as of today. You can bet a big move is in store when it reports on the 31st.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/allvol.png))**

&gt; If you're just interested in large-cap names, below is a list of the most volatile S&amp;P 500 stocks on earnings. These are stocks set to report over the next month, and as shown, Netflix (NFLX) is at the top of the list with an average one-day move of +/-12.78% on earnings. Twitter (TWTR), Align Tech (ALGN), TripAdvisor (TRIP), and Akamai (AKAM) rank 2nd through 5th in that order, while other notables include Amazon (AMZN), Advanced Micro (AMD), Chipotle (CMG), Facebook (FB), Electronic Arts (EA), and Wynn Resorts (WYNN).

&gt; If you own or have interest in owning any of these names, buckle up because they're likely to experience a big move when they report at some point in the next few weeks!

# Key Earnings Reports Over the Next Two Weeks

&gt; Our Earnings Calendar is part of our Earnings Explorer tool. The calendar shows the upcoming earnings report dates for US-listed companies over the next month, and investors use it as an easy way to monitor the names they're most interested in. We provide quite a bit of information for each company listed in the calendar, including EPS and sales estimates, its historical beat rates, and its average share price performance on its earnings reaction day. If you ever want to know how a stock typically trades in reaction to its earnings report, this is the place to go.

&gt; The Q3 2019 earnings reporting period finally kicks off next week when most of the big banks are set to report. But the biggest weeks for earnings will come in the back half of October and the first couple weeks of November. As shown in the chart below, the week of October 28th through November 1st is the busiest of them all when we'll see hundreds of companies report each day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/calen.png))**

&gt; Below is a list pulled from our Earnings Calendar of the key earnings reports to watch next week (based on market cap). There are no key reports to speak of on Monday the 14th due to Columbus Day, but on Tuesday we'll hear from Citigroup (C), Goldman (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) all before the open. On Wednesday, we'll get results from Bank of America (BAC) in the morning and then IBM and Netflix (NFLX) after the close, while on Thursday we'll hear from Morgan Stanley (MS), which will be the last of the major banks and brokers to report next week. American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO), and Schlumberger (SLB) will finish off the week with reports on Friday morning.

&gt; Of the key stocks reporting next week, Goldman (GS), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and UnitedHealth (UNH) beat EPS estimates the most often at more than 90% of the time. In terms of price reactions, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) -- which reports on Thursday afternoon -- has historically reacted the most positively to earnings with an average one-day gain of 3.24%. Bank of America (BAC) has the weakest price reaction to earnings with an average one-day drop of 0.95%.

&gt; In terms of earnings volatility, Netflix (NFLX) takes the cake with an average absolute one-day change of 12.78% on its earnings reaction day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/key-reports-next-week-use.png))**

&gt; The following week (10/21-10/25) is when we'll really be in the heart of the Q3 reporting period. A large number of Dow 30 stocks will report that week, including big blue chips like McDonald's (MCD), United Tech (UTX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Intel (INTC), and Microsoft (MSFT). The most important report of the week will come on Thursday the 24th when Amazon (AMZN) announces after the close. AMZN is currently expected to announce earnings of $7.19/share and revenues of $68.7 billion for the quarter. AMZN doesn't have an abnormally high EPS beat rate at just 62.5%, but it is typically a very volatile name as its average one-day move on earnings has historically been nearly +/-10%. Just think, a 10% move for AMZN is a $174 swing in either direction based on its current share price.

&gt; Just like that, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell more than 1% on the first day of October. The rough start has many investors on edge, as October is known for spectacular crashes—specifically 1929, 1987, and 2008.

&gt; On the flipside, September 2019 was historically calm for equity markets, as the S&amp;P 500 didn’t fall 1% on a single day the entire month.

&gt; “The lack of any volatility in September could mean the usually volatile month of October could be due for some big swings,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news, though, is while October has had a bad rap for some big drops, over the past 20 years, it actually has been the third best month of the year for stocks.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, October has quietly been one of the strongest months of the year over the past 10 and 20 years. Going back to 1950, it ranks as the seventh strongest month of the year, so right near the middle of the pack.

&gt; Four other things to consider:
Since 1950, no month has had more 1% moves (higher or lower) than October.
Since 1928, 6 of the 10 worst single-day drops have taken place in October; however, 3 of the 10 best days ever occurred in October as well.
This is a pre-election year, and as the chart above shows, October’s average returns in a pre-election year have been muted since 1950. The catch here is that this average return is greatly impacted by the 21.8% drop in 1987. The median return is actually quite respectable.
October has been higher during a pre-election year every year since 1999, with an average return of an impressive 6.5%.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my student loan debt?,"$80k federal student loan debt, average of 6.1% interest rates... Earn $60k a year before taxes, currently on the Income Driven Repayment Plan and payments are manageable. I'm trying to decide if it's worth it to refinance for a lower interest rate, but I keep reading about the ""protections"" of federal loans and not to give them up.

Federal loan forgiveness is a POSSIBLE future option, as I used to work in public service (with a qualifying repayment plan) and may again in the future, but it seems like I don't have enough debt to make that worthwhile... Thoughts?",finance
Economics,"Pretty good common folk economics journalism IMHO: Would you give up Google for $17,000 a year? The Fed wants to know",,finance
personalfinance,How can I make sure my debt is paid off?,"I just submitted the last $500 payment on my student loans a few days ago (horray!). Now, when I go the app for my servicer (Great Lakes Student Loan Services), it says the loan is ""paid in full"" and when I tap the payment button it says I am ""not eligible to make a payment at this time.""

So am I good? I understand I'm supposed to get a letter confirming that they're paid off. How long does that take? They were federal subsidized loans and my grace period is supposed to end on November 1st, so I don't think I have to worry about statement balance vs. payoff amount because they weren't collecting any interest, but is there a way to double check?",finance
personalfinance,How should I go about paying off our debt?,"My wife and I are finally in a situation where we will have quite a bit of extra money each month. We had made about 2 years of bad decisions and found ourselves overwhelmed with credit card debt and personal loans. Including our vehicles we sitting around 45,000 in debt. We enrolled in a debt relief program but nothing has been done other than making us feel like we was doing something but now we feel like we are just wheel spinning depositing money into that account for no reason.

Does anyone have any advice on how we should go about doing this? I also forgot to mention that we haven't payed anything on these accounts in over a year and half due to the debt relief program and falling into hard times. As I mentioned we just feel quite a bit overwhelmed with all this we are in a situation where we can start paying this stuff off but we don't know where to begin. We would like to find the easiest way to start paying these debts off and rebuilding our credit so that we can buy a house.|  


Gross Monthly Income is $4800  
We spend $2170 per month on bills:  


* $728 Vehicle Loans interest rate was 9% and 10% I don't have the remaining balances currently I wouldn't be able to get them until Monday
* $450 Electric
* $170 Storage
* $84 Car Insurance
* $310 Personal Loan  


We are using $930 a month to live off of Groceries, Gas, Fuel, Etc  


The remaining $1700 is what we have to play with this is what we aren't sure what we should do with. We have been told that if we just starting knocking out our debt and paying these accounts in full as quickly as possibly it wouldn't build are credit so we just doing to research currently.",finance
personalfinance,Amortization schedule calculation to determine if refi makes sense,"Hello.

I am trying to decide if it makes sense to refi my mortgage. And need help to see if I can calculate my own Amortization Schedule.

**Context:** 30 Year Fixed Loan ; 4.5% Rate ; Original Loan $416K ; Principal Today $360K. I have 25 years left in the loan (it was taken out in Sep 2014). I have extra income of about $500 that I can use to add to my mortgage payment every month.

Options under consideration: 

1. Refi to a 15 Year Fixed ; \~3.25% which means to pay about $440/Mo extra and I shorten the life of the loan and save in interest.
2. Simply stay with my same loan and pay $440/Mo extra.

This is the calculation I am trying to do: the impact of (2). i want to see if it makes sense to do it. I see a benefit in that it is less risky than a Refi, among other things.

I have made several additional principal payments through the life of my current loan here and there. I round up every month so a bit extra is paid every month. My loan servicing bank charges me $10 to send me an Amortization Schedule of my current loan.

**Question**: Is there a way to calculate, out of my current monthly breakdown of Principal, Interest, rate, principal left, original loan amount, and any other variables, my own amortization schedule as of today? Do I just take the existing Principal, and run that through a [bankrate.com](https://bankrate.com) calculator? Any excel or recommended ways to do this so I can save the $10, or do I just go ahead and bite the bullet and call the bank?

P.S. I was thinking about that too: Calling the bank, and telling them what I am trying to figure out, and see if they waive the $10. Worth asking.",finance
financialindependence,Weird question - I think I've made it?,"Hey all,

I've been following this sub off and on for a while now, and it's been awesome watching other people's ambitions in action. I've had the same ambition over the years, and suddenly find myself realizing that I may have actually reached financial independence 2 years ago, without realizing it. 

I'm wondering what to do with myself now. 

Long story short, I have real estate that is netting me about $2800 a month. That, right there, has me realizing I could become an expat and travel the world to many countries on that alone.

One of my pieces of real estate is near where I live (rented), and I could move into it, and still 'save' about $500 a month, after expenses (but not counting for medical).  I'm 47.

I live in a really expensive area of the US, and I'm renting, as well, which is, yes, costing me a bit.  I could move to my condo, and save some change, but I don't like living there, and I like where I am. So that's a cost I'm willing to accept.

All that said, given my current situation, I could potentially payoff another property in about 3-4 years, which will net me another $8k a year.

After all I said above, and knowing I'm now netting $2800 a month (not accounting for fed taxes I'll need to pay on that), does anyone who's already reached financial independence have any ideas about what I should be considering for the next few years? I'm still employed, though my hours are cut. So I'll be earning less.  I can take a pension in 2 years, due to my union contract, which I intend to take (around $45k).

personalfinance,Looking for a strategy for paying off student loans and saving up for a house while actually living life.,"I’m 32, I just graduated from nursing school in June and am currently working as a nurse at a hospital. I have $43,000 in federal student loans with interest rates ranging from 3.76% to 5.05%. I'm married without any kids, and we're not looking to have any. My wife is a teacher, and our joint income is $135,000/year (bring home is approximately $7,500/month). We currently have $16,000 in savings without any credit card debt, and the bills we have no control over (rent, car payment, insurance, utilities, phones, etc.) come out to roughly $2,200/month. Beyond that, our biggest spending is on food. This has varied dramatically since we have definitely lived less frugally since I got my job, but that will become more sensible once we have more concrete financial goals and plans in play. The main goals we have right now are to pay off my student loans in whatever way is the most responsible, save up to buy a house, and plan for retirement. 

Regarding student loans, I have no idea what the best plan is for paying them off. My assumption is that we should simply pay them off as quickly as possible? I’m guessing start with the loans with higher interest rates? The only other loan I’ve ever had is a car loan, so I’m ignorant here.

Regarding buying a house, we’re in no rush. We love the complex we live at, but given that we’re VERY settled into the jobs we have and the area we live in, it would make sense to save up and buy a very long-term home using our available time to our advantage to make sure we’re buying the right house. 

Regarding retirement, I’m very well aware I’m about a decade late on starting this. I plan on making up for this by simply working until I have a solid retirement plan set up, or until I physically cannot work any longer, whichever comes first. I have no problem working through my mid-70s. As of right now, my employer doesn’t make contributions to my retirement until one year of employment, at which point they will contribute a max of 4% if I pitch in 5%. They also have longevity contributions that start at 1.5% through the first 5 years of employment. 

What would y’all do in my situation? What would be the most responsible plan? I’ve always avoided thinking about my financial future given I’ve never had a solid career prior to now, so I’m doing my best to play catch-up at this point as quickly as I can.",finance
worldpolitics,Truths and Myths About the YPG/PKK (w/ sources),"So many people are upset about Trump's move to move 50 troops away from the Syrian-Turkish border. Many think that Turkey is about to genocide the Kurds without realizing that Turkey is only against the YPG/PKK or any organization that submits to the KCK (KCK=head of the snake, so to speak). The problem lies in the fact that the western MSM fails to show you the ugly side of the YPG/SDF. More so, we hear so much about Islamic terror that we seem to forget that even secular organizations can be terrorists.


Here is some myths and truths about the YPG/PKK

myth #1: The US teamed up with the YPG to primarily counter the Islamic state

truth: [The US realized that the Islamic Caliphate wouldn't be able to overthrow Assad by 2015. So the the US pivoted in their policy by pledging a coalition with the YPG. It was made clear from the beginning that the alliance was short term and strategic. The clandestine incentive for this coalition was to counter Iran and Assad as well as set the pre text for a future puppet ethno state.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/middle-east-watch/us-maximum-pressure-iran-unsettles-syrias-kurds-69107)

myth #2: They aren't terrorists. 

truth:  [The KCK is the umbrella organization of PYD/YPG, PKK, PÇDK, and PJAK. Having even as little as a tertiary connection to the PKK should be enough for the YPG/PYD to effectively be labeled as a terrorist organization.

The YPG in Syria are complicit in war crimes that MSM never reports.

1.	[the YPG called coalition strikes in specific regions in NE Syria where ISIS never reigned. It just so happens that those regions have the highest death toll of civilians. The YPG threatened civilians with coalition strikes if they did not flee their homes. Another dirty tactic the YPG used to ethnically cleanse Syrians: The YPG would purposely retreat from areas without warning civilians before ISIS took over.](https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/syria-raqqa-in-ruins-and-civilians-devastated-after-us-led-war-of-annihilation/) | [bonus](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/us-backed-kurdish-forces-committing-war-crimes-against-syrian-civilians)

2.	[The YPG is a pseudo democracy. It is a de facto military dictatorship. The YPG/SDF directly take orders from the KCK. The people that are included in the federalization municipalities are cosmetic positions with no real powers. Each and every-time the YPG sent negotiators to Damascus, it was done so by the orders of the PKK and KCK. Furthermore, each and every time it was the KCK and PKK who set the negotiating terms from Damascus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Communities_Union)

5.	[The YPG complies with US demands to sanction the Syrian people of the mainland from their own national resources. With the help of the US and Israel, the YPG was able to loot $400m of Syria's formerly nationalized oil from regions which are Syrian majority. The US has the audacity to deprive the Syrian people from their very own oil whilst also preventing Iran from exporting oil to Syria.](https://thedefensepost.com/2018/04/13/opinion-mattis-america-defending-syria-oilfields/)

myth #3: The YPG/PKK represents all Kurds and that all Kurds want to be independent  

truth: if you have not noticed by now, every MSM article includes only images of the women fighters. You can easily verify this yourself. This is to perverse your brain with the idea that Kurds are the only bastion of secularism and feminism in the middle east. The secularist Kurds are really a minority. In fact, Kurds as a whole are more religious than Turks, Syrians, Iraqis, and Iranians. Many Kurds in Turkey hate the YPG/SDF and PKK because they are Islamists themselves. Also there many Kurds who have fought for the FSA and ISIS. In fact, a very large portion of Erdogan's AKP voter bass are in fact Kurds. Furthermore, many Kurdish parents are fed up with their children being abducted and abused so that they are forced into conscription. 

Also independence for Kurds means that they would lose access to the economic opportunity in Turkey in places such as Istanbul.

myth #4: Turkey is racist and inherently against Kurds.

truth: your are projecting your own western racism upon others. The fact is, it is all political and not racial. Kurds are citizens with full rights who elect Kurdish lead political parties such as the HDP. They have free healthcare and education like any other Turkish citizen. Turkey also invests a lot of capital in Kurdish majority areas to raise them out of poverty. However, the HDP abuses their power and has many connections to the PKK which is why Turkey had to arrest HDP mayors

Mind you, Turkey has 15m Kurds, 300,000 of which are Kurdish refugees from Syria. Even Erdogan's AKP party has 50+ Kurdish members in his cabinet.",energy

I am set on refinancing my mortgage soon since we got in on what I feel is not a great rate — 4.99% on 30yr fixed. Coming up soon on 1 year into the term. My goal is to keep the same term length or about the same. Anticipated benefit is faster equity build and slightly lower required monthly payment. 

I understand that interest rates are dropping lately which helps my cause. 

My question is what do you think is a good time to start putting this into motion? For example, should I start today? Wait a few months? I understand the future can’t be predicted regarding how far down rates will go nor for how long into future... so I figure I’m only asking for opinions.

investing,How does foreign govt bonds price change with yield when they are US dollar denominated?,"Lets say I have a US dollar denominated govt bond from Mexico or Poland, and one of these countries decides to lower their short term interest rates. How does the price of US dollar denominated debt change compared to the govt bonds that are denominated in the local currency (pesos, etc)? We all know that decreasing market interest rate makes existing bonds increase in value. But is it the same here in this case?

I like the emerging markets US denominated govt bond funds (EMB, VWOB) for the current yield and what I \*think\* is potentially big upside if the global interest rate environment goes towards zero/negative in any potential upcoming recession.

But I do want to check my assumptions. We have all seen bond prices rise in the G7 as those countries push rates lower. Is it safe to say that these emerging market US denominated dollar bonds would benefit from a decreasing interest rate in that country in the same way as the local currency bond would?

I'm looking to make a play with a small percentage of my assets, maybe 5-10% here. So this isn't a crazy big bet for me or anything.  But I want to hear more of the bear case for DD.",finance

financialindependence,Do you think that FIRE is mostly an aspirational thing for a majority of people?,"Everyone dreams of retiring early. The hyper-capitalist nature of our society, plus the precariousness of employment, means that people have to work longer and harder than previous generations to keep their job and stay ahead. 

I graduated from college 6 years ago without any debt. My first job offered a salary of $35,000, and it was the best I could do at the time. I lived with my parents until age 26. I didn't make more than $50,000 a year until 2019, when I got a job paying $70,000.

I prioritized saving for retirement and was extremely frugal. But still, here I am, at age 28 with only $125,000 in retirement assets (plus $25,000 in cash that I don't count towards retirement). I suspect that I will be working until age 70 if I can. 

But the thing is... I currently enjoy my job. I work for the federal government. I don't look at email on the weekend, express anxiety about upcoming project milestones, or fear too much about layoffs. I work 40 hours a week and never have to think about work outside of work. Compared to some other jobs I've had, being a government employee is like being semi-retired. I have a lot of time to myself to read and write, and do the things I enjoy doing. 

So many people want to do FIRE because they are anxious about their jobs or their jobs are such a big source of stress they just want to get rid of it. 

I suspect that the only people who can seriously do FIRE are people who have a high starting salary out of school (software engineer, consulting, investment banking, etc.), embrace being frugal, and even then it takes these people into their 30s to finally retire. But even when they retire, all it takes is one medical emergency (e.g. cancer) to throw a wrench into those plans. 

Not everyone can or has the aspirations to achieve these extremely high-paying jobs. Not everyone wants to give up raising a family to retire early. Not everyone wants to live in a shitty apartment with a million roommates and eat a can of beans for dinner every night during the prime of their life.

I suspect the answer for many is not FIRE necessarily, but fairer labor conditions where people are not always squeezed out to the last drop while still being compensated fairly.",finance

**Myfedloan:** $20,694.12 - 4.7% interest - this will increase if I continue school.

**Wells Fargo (private):** $2,855.85 - 8.74% interest - on deferment

Current loan is a 30 yr. fixed with 22.5 yrs. to go on $315k.  Rate is 4.125%, balance is $266.5k, and the value is somewhere between 375 and 400k.  Loan originated 7/2014, but in the beginning, we were making extra principal pmts.

I contribute 20% to a 401k and get a 6% employer match.  That's not maxed out.  My wife is a teacher and has a pretty good retirement plan, but it's also not maxed out.  I contribute the annual max. to an HSA for myself.  We contribute $400/mo. into a 529 plan for our kid.  We have a healthy emergency fund in an HYSA.

We pay around $215/mo. on a student loan for my wife as part of a loan forgiveness program, so the loan's interest rate isn't a factor.

personalfinance,Choosing between a conventional loan and a FHA loan,"Hello all, it's my first post here and I'm likely not quite as versed in finance as the average member of this sub so bear with me.

My partner and I have been saving for a little over a year to buy a home. We've got about $25,000 in the bank, a couple grand in an IRA, $5,000 in a CD and some money in a 401k we don't want to touch. My partner and I have a combined gross income of $86,000 but my partner will be the only person on the loan documents. My partner's credit score is 792.

We are looking to purchase a home in the $300,000 to $350,000 range. Back in July we were looking into the Fannie HomeReady program but the requirements were changed at the end of that month and my partner no longer meets the max income requirements. Because of this, we are now considering an FHA loan due to it being the only reduced rate program my partner would qualify for now (I'm open if you know of others besides HomeReady!).

My question is mostly concerning the MIP on the FHA loans. My partner is able to get an FHA loan at 2.625% interest rate which would be a payment of $1,719 per month, $203 of which would be MIP, or a conventional loan at 4.25% interest rate which would amount to a monthly payment of $1,906, $141 of which would be mortgage insurance. The lower interest rate makes a significant difference of $100,000 over the life of the loan. The thing we're having trouble understanding is if this is true savings or if the savings in interest over the life of the loan is going to be eaten up by the MIP on the FHA loan. We don't have enough to put 10% down so we would likely be stuck with the MIP for the life of the loan (unless we refinance at some point to a conventional loan, who knows where rates will be in the future).

I've seen mixed information online regarding if the MIP is the same monthly cost for the life of the loan or if it goes down over the years as you pay your loan.

Are there any good calculators online to compare these loan products in depth over the life of the loan? I'm having trouble understanding the ins and outs enough to conceptualize this into a spreadsheet.

Do you have any advice to offer a finance noob or questions I could ask the loan person we're working with to better understand what is the better ""deal"" in our scenario?

personalfinance,Credit card debt consolidation recommendations?,"So i have about 13k in CC debt. I believe they are just 2 standard Visa cards with the standard interest rates something like 25% or higher. I want to get a personal loan or something of the sort to pay them all off and cancel the cards and pay monthly installments toward the loan instead. My credit score is in the mid to high 600s, and I can afford about $600 a month toward the loan. 

I have found offers online, one example from bestegg for $12250 12.49% at about $565 per month for 24 months. Is something like that a good deal?

Credit card debt is just so cumbersome. It is all my fault for using the card but basically I pay it down about 500 a month only to use it again so the debt never really goes anywhere. I can make the adjustments I need to in my life to not use a credit card if I didn't have it which is why I want to pay them all off and cancel them. That way there is no way to use the cards because they wont exist. The loan I can pay down like I do my car or my insurance and even on autopay on my wife and i's joint account. 

I guess my question is, is this a smart move if my goal is to eliminate my credit card debt? Is there a better way to do this? Am I just bad at managing my money...? Thanks guys for any and a help.",finance

personalfinance,"[30M, Lawyer] 401k Savings vs. House vs. Investments? No debt.","I am new to personal finance and am wondering if I should devote my time to saving to buy a home ASAP (and if so, what kind of home) or saving for my 401k (roth or traditional?).  I recently became a lawyer, paid off all my student loans 1.5 years ago, and still live with my parents to save money.  I am single, do not intend to retire early, am on the fence about having kids before 40 (if at all), and expect to be working for the rest of my life in some capacity.  I have good credit.  Post-tax I take home a little over $7k/month.  Located in NJ.

My father is fiscally conservative and suggested that I put 10% into a trad. 401k into a principal protected fund and save aggressively until I can purchase some kind of investment property-style real estate (and move in).  He says that this will help me from a tax perspective as well, so that I can write off the mortgage payments.  Financial advisors are telling me that putting my money into a principally protected fund with 1.7% interest rate is a stupid idea since I will basically gain no money doing it that way.  I've also read a post here where people were talking about how a home is a terrible way to grow your money.

I personally want to put everything into a Roth 401k because I expect my earnings to go up (since I don't plan a traditional retirement and have partnership aspirations).  I'm also concerned about the underfunding of SSI and worry that federal income tax %ages will rise by the time I am 59.  My mentor (also a lawyer) agrees with me and has done largely the same thing.  I would also like to live a little since part of me feels that I kind of lost my best years living the way that I did (gave up drinking, going out to eat, etc. for the past 6 years), and I'd like to move out at some point.

If I can put away $5k every month, how should I put it away?  Should I max out my 401k or focus on saving for a house?  Roth or Trad, given my conditions (I understand that I will have a trad regardless due to match)?  Property values around here are absolutely insane, and if I were to buy a multi-family home, it would probably cost $4k per month(nothing including $1k/month property taxes) on a 30 year mortgage alone.  Am I better off just renting ($2000-$3000/month for a studio) in perpetuum?",finance
personalfinance,NEED ADVICE - Help me and my wife's future!,"Hello everyone! My wife and I just got married and are planning out our short term and long term goals. Here are the details:

\- We are 28 and live a high COL area. Our combined income is about 300k.

\- We have 225k combined in student loans. I pay about 2.2k/month and she pays about 1.6k/month. Our interest rates are between 5-7.5%

\- Our future forever home will likely run us about 650k in our area and will have 15k property taxes per year, so we don't feel ready for a house. We are currently renting at 2k/month which is middle of the road where we are. We don't love the idea of renting and not building equity in something, however the starter homes will still run us about 350k. The mortgage + taxes on this will cost us similar to our current monthly rent cost. 

\- We are not yet maxing out our 401ks, just enough to get our match which is about 6%.

\- We have no credit card debt as of this week! So now we need to find some direction with our finances and goals.

\- We have an emergency fund of 25k.

Our pickle is that we don't know what to do with our money.  So here are our questions (some might be subjective but I'd love your opinions). Should we keep doing the match, or max out our 401k? Should we forget the future home and buy a condo/starter home this way we build equity - and worry about a forever home in 5-10 years? Should we forget all that and just go to town on our student loans? Or does it make sense to keep doing a hybrid plan and pay our student loans and save for a large down payment all at once?

While I feel fortunate to have the income we do, our student loans and our geographical region are a burden on us.

We're having trouble figuring out the best strategy in being able to save for the short-term all while paying our bills and planning for our future. I do not want to fall behind on retirement either so I wanted to reach out to you experts. Thanks all!",finance

personalfinance,Car lease ending. Buy it out or find cheaper options,"Just getting some input from some of the PF crew. I'm currently leasing a 2017 car, the lease ends in August of 2020 but I will hit my miles limit far before that (currently at 28k miles with 30k alloted). As of today, the kbb/ trade-in value of the car is roughly $11k.

Im paying $200/mo, if I purchased out of the lease for no additional charges, payments would bump up to ~$300 (I don't remember the interest rate but let's say 3%). I owe ~14k now which would drop to 12k at lease end as more payments insued. If I purchased the car (today or lease end) I would not be able to buy it cash (that would wipe out my 10k emergency fund I have set aside). I would have to finance some of it even if I put some cash down on the remaining balance.

I pretty much have two options unless I'm forgetting something:

1) at lease end, purchase the vehicle with $12k owed instead of returning it. Avoiding the mileage overcharge, Finance the remaining balance probably increasing payments to $300 +/- maybe less if I start saving up for a larger down payment.

2) Work with the dealer in the next couple months to have them buy out the lease and see if I can get a good deal on a used car that's cheaper   
   --ideally using the 11k the car is worth but I don't know if I would get any deal on a used car.

I think anything else incurs paying more money. If I go till lease end and return the car, i'll have the extra milage charges (probably 1-2k by my estimation). If I purchase the vehicle for ~14k today and then try to sell it, I'll likely lose ~3k.",finance
personalfinance,Got a new car with a rate that's not the best. Should I refinance now or wait a bit for better resources to open up?,"Hi PF, it's me, the girl who keeps getting horrible financial advice from the people around me, and I'm back again to hopefully get things cleared up.

(tl;dr: I got a 2016 Mazda 3 for 14,400$ @12.54% for 72 months, with the intention to refinance a few months from now when I have better resources at my disposal. My dad is mad and is telling me to either refinance now or go buy a brand new CX-5 at a rate I am fairly certain I don't have the credit score for.)

Long story short, my old car was giving me problems that would have cost me more money in time and repairs than I had. My old car's trade in value at Carmax after loan payoff and everything was about 4500$, which was over 1000$ more than I was expecting to get. I walked out of Carmax with a 2016 Mazda 3 that I've been wanting for 14,400$ @ 12.45% for 72 months.

Since this was a sudden thing, I didn't have time to improve my 660 credit score or shop around. I'm currently paying off my debts faster than I was expecting, I was hoping to clear my credit card debts around next July, but I could have it all paid off around May with my current rate. In addition, my employer offers assistance with car buying and car loans, and I'm getting my tuition reimbursed next month, so I feel that waiting a few months longer is a good time to refinance. (This way I also get to save up some money to throw in)

But here's the catch.

My dad is mad at me, he swears that he can get me in a BRAND NEW 2019 MAZDA CX-5 for 0% INTEREST RATE! I told him about my credit score and he swears it doesn't matter, he used to work in car sales so he knows how it works. I keep trying to explain to him that it's not in my budget to go buy a brand-new 24,000$ car regardless of the interest rate, so he tells me to refinance it right now with Capital One and to stop wasting my time and money. I looked into Capital One and it just doesn't seem feasible at this time, I want to wait a little longer and see what better offers I can get with the employee assistance and etc. He's not helping me out with payments at all, so I don't want to risk anything at the moment and just focus on my credit cards.

We've been arguing over this for weeks now. Should I just go get it refinanced and hope I get a better offer, or should I continue with my original plan to focus on credit card debt first and then worry about refinancing when I have better resources available to me?",finance
personalfinance,What % of savings should be invested vs. in savings account/CD/etc?,"Hi all,

I'm in my mid 20s, and I'm fortunate enough to have a pretty significant amount of savings compared to people my age. However, I always feel like I'm not investing enough, and I would like to ask for opinions and suggestions on how to handle my money.

I'm the type of person who really doesn't like risks...

Here is what I already did/am doing:

* Max out my 401k every year ($18,500)
* Bought a primary residence (\~50% is still mortgage, Interest rate is \~3%)
* Wealthfront $15,000 investment (it's been 2 years, but the $$ in there has no growth!! I'm kind of disappointed. My risk score is 7)
* About low 6-digit amount of money in high yield savings account (CIT bank, about 2.2% APY and Discover)
* Company issued restricted stock units. About low 6-digit if converted to monetary value

As you can see, inflation/mortgage rate is already a lot higher than the 2.2% APY that I'm earning through my savings account... not to mention the income tax on top of the interest. I need to put my money elsewhere that hopefully can still have low risks. Things I've heard about but don't have knowledge in:

* CD (where has a good rate? I probably won't consider it if it's less than 3% for 5 years)
* HSA (what does it mean that I'm putting more than necessary money in HSA?! I can't use it for anything but medical purposes?)
* ETF/bonds (I started looking into high dividend bonds. These seem to have good yield/year with low risks. What are the recommendations?)
* Investment properties (I looked into this and it seems not profitable at all with mortgage + property taxes... unless I can buy one all-cash D:&gt;)
* Other recommendations?

&amp;#x200B;

Right now about 50% of my liquid assets are in stocks (company-issued) and 50% of it being cash in savings accounts. I've actually never purchased a single stock on my own... anyway, what % in each category is ideal for people my age? What should I be doing more? Should I hire a financial advisor?

personalfinance,Which Health Insurance To Pick? (Federal Employee),"So am I fortunate that my wife is an employee with the U.S. Federal Government so we get great health insurance options. Right now we have their most expensive and best plan from Blue Cross Blue Shield. We are happy with it and in total the recent birth of our first child costed an entire $350.00 out of pocket from the day we found out my wife was pregnant to the day our child left the hospital. 

Its enrollment period is coming next month and I am trying to figure out what plan is best. The current standard plan we have, which we are happy with cost us $581/month out of my wife's salary. The basic option instead from Blue Cross would cost $384/month. So savings of $2,364 which would be nice given our property taxes were recently reassessed from our recent purchase and I know my mortgage is going up just about $200/month soon. 

$2,364.00 is helpful for us. We have a decent amount of expensive even with our good incomes We average around $11k/month in expenses (mortgage &amp; student loans 35% of that) Average take home is around $13.5-$14k. So not a huge margin for change. My income fluctuates but that has been the average over the past 18-months or so for us after tax. 

So looking at the plan benefits [see here](https://www.fepblue.org/benefit-plans/compare-plans-2019) for a young family I think switching to basic makes sense. The only big upside that I see with the standard is out of network care. But all our doctors that we like accept Blue Cross already and most do it seems. While if for some reason we really did not like this plan or needed some out of network care in the future we always have the option to change back every year. 

Any thoughts and advice on this is much appreciated.

personalfinance,Refinancing. Pay this months mortgage on old loan or late fee instead?,"Hello all!

I'm refinancing to take advantage of the current low loan interest rates, despite having purchased our house less than a year ago.   We will close by the end of the month. 

Should I pay the October mortgage payment, which is appx $1150 of interest and $500 principal, or not pay it and pay a late fee instead ($65)?  Logically it seems like if I pay it I'm giving $1150 to a bank that I'll never see again given that I'm about to pay the entire principal on the old loan, so for that reason I should pay the late fee, but I'm wondering if I'm missing something.  Refinance broker assures me that it won't affect my credit because of when the refinance will be recorded (but honestly I would take a temp hit to my excellent credit for $1150...)

Details, if they matter:

Old loan: 30 year fixed, 29 years remaining at 4.375%, appx 244,000$ principal remaining.

New loan: 15 year fixed at 3.000%, appx $2100 closing costs for appx 3.097% APR on a $243,000 loan.",finance

personalfinance,Apply for loan or continue making cc payments?,"I have been incredibly stupid with my finances, running up credit card debt, until recently. Now I’ve made a budget, created a payoff plan, and have been making extra payments on my four cards. My debt was at ~$17,000 and I expect to have it down to $3,000-4,000 by the end of December. I could finish paying them off by mid to late March, with a few more months of interest included. 

I’ve been considering applying for a loan from my bank at the beginning of January to pay them off completely. I want to wait till then so I’ll have brought down my utilization percent significantly and qualify for a better interest rate. At that point taking out a loan wouldn’t really save much interest. I could also try for a 0% balance transfer card but I’m not super familiar with that method. 

So, would it be worth it to try to get a loan with a low interest rate? Or a balance transfer card? My credit cards all have an interest rate around 20%. Would it help my credit to have an additional loan or card (my car is paid off and I don’t have a mortgage, only debt is cc) or would it hurt it more to have a hard inquiry and shorter average account life? I am planning to save up and buy a house in a little more than a year and a half so increasing my credit score (currently in the lower 700s) is also important.

personalfinance,Cash-out refi for credit card debt,"Howdy r/personalfinance, looking to get some insight on whether not I should use a  cash-out refi to consolidate credit card debt.

I have about $20k in credit card debt that is mostly accrued from poor decisions when I was younger and in college. I have been working diligently on getting that down by using balance transfers and paying as much as I can afford, but I haven't been able to pay off as much as I'd like and the monthly payments and interest is really weighing me down financially.

I have already begun the process of working with a lender and have had my house appraised, but before I pull the trigger and finish this off, I figured I would reach out to reddit and get some more opinions on it.

So here is my current situation:

* Bought the house just over three years ago at $285k
* My current balance is about $262k plus a second $10k that was part of a first home buyers program.
* Current interest rate is 4.625%
* Monthly mortgage payment (principal/interest/insurance/mortgage insurance): $1750
* $20k credit card debt

Housing market in my area has blown up and due to the location, I don't really see it dropping significantly any time soon. My house was just appraised at $430k, so here is what I would be looking at with the refi:

* New loan of $299,600 (Mortgage 1, Mortgage 2 from first home buyers , Debt, closing costs)
* Lower interest rate of 4.375%
* Eliminate mortgage insurance as I will be at 70% home value
* Estimated monthly mortgage payment (principal/interest/insurance/mortgage insurance): $1785

Not having to worry and stress about my credit card debt is going to be a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I will be saving myself $400-$600 a month in credit card payments while barely bumping up my mortgage payment. I feel like I'll finally be able to start putting aside money for savings as opposed to living paycheck to paycheck trying to knock down debt.

I understand how I got there in the first place and have grown up and have learned a lot from my mistakes, so I have no intentions of racking those cards up again. Since I just paid to have my house appraised, my plan is to also apply for a HELOC, just to use as an emergency fund, making repairs on the house, etc.

My mortgage will basically be starting over at 30 years, but I really haven't knocked much principal down anyway since I've only owned the home three years so I don't see that as a huuuge issue.

Does this seem like a logical plan?",finance
investing,Oil is the play,"I feel like investing from this moment forward for the next year is going to be difficult.

Oil is the only thing I can make a case for having great upside. 

The dollar is about done going up. (Rather than go into why please look up my history I called the dollar going up when everyone was bearish). Remember oil is priced in dollars

Economic data/ earnings should be bad enough to get the market to force the fed to act and become dovish, really to have them force inflation. We should see commodities and food go up in price. 

Many think if there is bad economic data demand will go down but oil is an inelastic good and Projections aren’t for a major contraction unless the fed fails to act, which I think is unlikely given their past.

So that leaves us at a place where inflation is likely coming forced by the fed. And oil which is hated by everyone is a great way to play that. You could also play TIPS. 

I’d love feedback and for you to dive into my past posts to judge my views before and how they’ve played out. Last year I was saying get long the dollar and bonds and you can go back and see for yourself.",finance
personalfinance,Overtaxed on Paycheck?,"Will someone look over this and let me know what's up?  Am I being taxed too much?

I don't want to assume malicious intent on the part of my employer, but it looks to me like they're placing their tax responsibilities onto us.

Myself and all the other employees I checked with are being taxed at a 40-55% rate overall.

I expect to make about $3300 by the end of this year from April to December for this job. I'm a waged waitress making $6.40/hr plus cash tips out of a pool. My tips aren't included in my net income.

* Social Security: 6.2% on you (out of check), 6.2% on employer
* Medicare: 1.45% on you (out of check), 1.45% on employer
* Fed Income Tax: Bracketed, I should be around 12%
* IL Income tax: 4.95%

But here's what my check actually looks like. The rates are as follows:

* Gross Earnings:
   * 52.75 hours worked at $6.40/hr. total pay at $337.60
   * Tips this period: $348 (not accurate they just guess since we don't report)
* Witholdings:
   * Social Security: $42.51 OR 12%
   * Medicare: $9.94 OR 2.9%
   * Fed Income Tax: $57.27 OR 16.9%
   * IL Income tax: $33.94 OR 10%
   * Total witholdings: $143.66
* Deductions
   * Advance: $3.75 (I don't even know what this is?

My boss filled out my W-4 for me so I don't know what he put down in Line 5. It's probably 0. I qualify for 1-2 exemptions.

But it feels very wrong that I'm getting almost half my paycheck at such a low paying job taken out for taxes.

This employer is also not paying overtime to anyone, but that's another story. (It's why I'm a bit suspicious but I want to assume it's all a mistake)

personalfinance,Should we take Pension Buyout Offer?,"(Tried to copy/paste from Word, can't figure out the formatting here. Looks like you guys get a giant block of text)

Here is our situation:

My wife was offered a pension buyout this month from a previous employer, and we are trying to figure out the best course of action. 
•	Me:M39; Wife:F38—Two kids, ages 7 and 5
•	HH income: Around $10k/month (before taxes) and growing
•	Opened our business 3 years ago, made the mistake of using high interest debts to help fund the start up. 
•	Used all of our savings and retirement accounts opening the business. We currently have no emergency fund and nothing saved for retirement. 
•	Debt: 
o	Credit Card-$4819.03-$14.74%
o	Business Loan-$21,666.26-11.54% interest
o	Auto Loan-$3270.44-6.29% interest
•	Taxes
o	We also got behind on our income taxes to keep our business afloat, total of around $50,000 that we owe to the IRS right now. We are on a payment plan at about 5.5% interest/penalty. 
Details of pension/buyout:
•	Pension is through city govt. so it is a 457b, meaning no early withdrawal penalty. It is all taxable at normal income tax rate. 
•	At 55 years old she will start receiving a monthly payment of $938.66. She will receive this until her death, but guaranteed for 120 months.
•	The buyout offer is $39,444. This would be paid to us this Dec/Jan. 
Options we have considered:
1.	Do not take the buyout, receive the monthly payments:		
a.	Pros
i.	Guaranteed income for life
b.	Cons
i.	I’m assuming that when she dies it dies with her (we can chose a survivorship option when we annuitize, but that would substantially reduce the monthly amount). 
ii.	Bad rate of return, assuming she lives until 80 she will have received $281,565. 
iii.	No control of the funds, can’t pass them down to heirs. 
2.	Take the buyout and roll it into an IRA:
a.	Pros
i.	Will have complete ownership, can pass to me/our heirs. 
ii.	It’s very likely we would get a much better return taking it now and just putting it in an S&amp;P 500 index fund. There is more volatility risk involved, but since we don’t plan on this being even close to our entire nest egg, there is a very low chance that we will actually start needing to withdraw at 55, giving us flexibility if the market happens to take a big dip around that time. 
iii.	Don’t have to worry about the pension being mismanaged, etc. 
b.	Cons
i.	I’m assuming since we would roll to an IRA, we would be subject to the 10% early withdraw penalty. 
ii.	Our investments could do poorly
3.	Take the buyout and pay off Debt:
a.	Pros
i.	Avoid high interest rates
ii.	Would free up $689.82/month to pay toward back taxes
iii.	Allow us to more quickly get to a place where we can systematically save for retirement each month. 
iv.	Would have about $2000 left to set aside as a mini-emergency fund. 
b.	Cons
i.	Have to pay taxes on it, probably at a high rate because it is on top of our regular income.  (They automatically withhold 20% if we don’t roll into an IRA)
ii.	We would have absolutely nothing saved for retirement. 
iii.	We will still be paying off the back taxes for probably two years, even with the increased room in our budget.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

For a long time you’ve wanted to buy a new car and you know you’ll need a loan to do it. You have $4,000 in savings and figure you can afford a monthly payment of $300. A quick check on the Internet tells you that you can get a four-year loan at 2¾ percent interest. Payments are $220 a month for each $10,000 you borrow. That is, $10,000 is the present value of $220 per month for 48 months at a monthly interest rate of 0.22633 percent (the monthly rate compounded that equals 2¾ percent per year). Because you can afford a $300 payment, you can get a loan of up to $13,636, or (300/220) \* $10,000. With a $4,000 down payment, you can afford a car that costs $17,636. 

You don’t have to buy the car right away, however. You could wait and drive your old car a while longer. What if you wait a year to buy the car? Waiting means you should put $300 per month into the bank along with the $4,000 you already have. At 1 percent interest, at the end of a year you will have $7,659—the future value of the $4,000 plus 12 monthly contributions of $300 each.",finance
personalfinance,Estimating 401k Growth,"These are some pretty basic questions but I just wanna make sure I have a solid understanding for when I'm running my calculations.

I've heard that a nice conservative but accurate estimate for 401k growth is 6% per year, on average. Does this mean that the entire 401k grows by 6% per year? For example:

Over Year 1: $5000 is deposited in to the account

Over Year 2: the $5000 in the account grows to $5300 and another $5000 is deposited into the account

Over Year 3: the $10,300 in the account grows to $10,918 and another $5000 is deposited into the account

and so on...

And if this is accurate, my follow-up question is:

Could I convert this 6% annual growth to an ""effective monthly growth rate"" and build an excel table that will estimate the monthly growth of the account?

And if so, last follow-up question: In order to convert 6% annual growth to an effective monthly growth rate, would I use the same formula for converting an APR to an effective monthly growth rate? That formula is:

\[(1 + nominal interest rate/ number of compounding periods)\^(number of compounding periods)\] - 1

Thank you all in advance!

All other spending done on credit cards:

This year is a bit unique as we got married in spring and then moved across the country and have had a lot of expenses with that. We’re also planning a honeymoon for Christmas that’s half paid for already, but will total ~$8,000. 

**The house:**
Sale price: $421,000

We’re getting a 30yr conventional mortgage, hoping for an interest rate at or below 4%

Plan is to put 15% down so we still have $35,000 for an emergency fund and cash for furnishings etc. 

Looks like PMI will be about $180/mo, bringing our total mortgage (including taxes and insurance) to $2400 after the HOA at $130/mo. 

**My concern:** 
$2400 is 30% of our take home pay, which is much more debt than we’re used to paying. Previous mortgage in LCOL was only 18% of take home. 

We will likely need a newer vehicle in a few years so with an estimated $400/mo car payment we’re at 35% of take home pay going to debt. 

Obviously at that percentage it‘s doable, but I’m not sure how much our lifestyle would need to adjust. If we continue to have CC balances around $4k that doesn’t leave much room to save for large purchases. 

Are we making the right decision? It’s basically our ideal home in an ideal location and seems worth the cost, but I don’t want us to feel strained either. It’s the largest purchase we’ve ever made by far as well and has us pretty nervous.",finance

I posted in the weekday help thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/dehxeg/weekday_help_and_victory_thread_for_the_week_of/f2ynf4u/) a week ago and we got a couple contrasting viewpoints (from /u/bw1979 and /u/chameleonsEverywhere) so I thought the opportunity for more viewpoints and counterpoints may be helpful to me and others in similar situations.

The basic premise triggering this conversation is that I owe six figures in student loan debt and another five figures in unpaid interest. **Theoretically, after 25 years of making the minimum IBR payments, the remainder of the student loan debt is forgiven. BUT under the current rules, the total amount forgiven (both principal and interest) upon completion of the IBR program will be treated as taxable income (the ""tax bomb"").**

&gt;More specifically to my personal scenario, I owe approximately $158K in student loan debt and another $30K in unpaid interest (law school and living expenses were funded entirely by federal loans; the income-producing ball didn't quite get rolling the way one would hope, so the interest accumulation ball got rolling instead). I am now coming up on five years through the 25-year IBR program.

&gt;I make one IBR payment a month that's divided between seven loans (one subsidized, six unsubsidized) of varying amounts ranging from $8,550 to $42.6K, with interest rates ranging from 5.16% to 7.65%. I owe anywhere from $2,900 to $9,600 in unpaid interest on each of the six unsubsidized loans, and about $240 in unpaid interest on that $8,550 subsidized loan. Altogether, the loans accrue a combined $28.97 a day in interest (and it will remain that amount until I begin cracking into principal), and my current IBR minimum is $578.31. **If I pay the IBR minimum calculated based on my current take-home pay, the unpaid interest backlog will continue to accumulate.**   
&gt;  
&gt;With that in mind, and in the absence of any real advice on this issue, I've paid about double the IBR minimum for the past year to cover each month's accrued interest for every loan and to shave a little off the top of the outstanding interest for each one (prioritizing the backlogs of the highest interest rate loans, but with no real mathematical precision). As of this month, I will have paid approximately $20K in interest and a whopping $21.49 in principal (I think I cracked into the subsidized loan principal once) over the past five years.   
&gt;  
&gt;Herein lies the rub (at least for me): I currently take home about $3,145 a month after taxes, (admittedly aggressive) retirement savings, and other witholdings - so I'm spending approximately 1/3 of the liquid income deposited into my bank account on student loan debt relief, on top of my mortgage and other bills and expenses, and my margins have been very tight. You know, the scenario the IBR plan was created to avoid. Given the weight I'm starting to feel, I have been trying to find anything resembling concrete guidance, thus far to no avail.

The question then, is **how should I - and those in similar student loan scenarios - treat repayment under IBR plans to minimize the amount of money we pay over the life of the 25-year program (and for any subsequent tax implications), so we aren't throwing good money after bad?** Given that in my case, I don't realistically expect to earn enough to pay off the full loan amount within the next 20 years (my rough back-of-the-envelope math says that at this income and my current payment rate, it'll take me a decade just to finish off the unpaid interest backlog), is it helpful to push hundreds of extra dollars a month into payments to keep the total from growing? **Is freezing/reversing the growth of the unpaid interest backlog even important in such a large-debt IBR scenario? Or is this just throwing money away? In the alternative, should we instead pay solely the IBR minimum, saving the extra dollars in anticipation of the income tax bomb? Or is something else preferable?**

In my previous post, one response mentioned that an IBR participant will be paying 37 cents on the dollar when hit with the tax bomb which would indicate that, on paper, simply paying the bare minimum IBR is the most mathematically efficient route. The flip side is that the answer is very future-dependent, and we can't predict everything. Most people expect that income will grow, the financial situation will improve, and larger payments can be accomodated. But more questionably, the federal program isn't old enough to see how IBR plans have been forgiven in the past and federal policy (and tax rates) are always subject to change - both by elected officials (see: candidates' campaign platforms) and through administrative means (see: how the Department of Education handled the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program when the first class of participants hit their 10-year eligibility mark to apply for forgiveness). Theoretically, the IBR plan could be stripped back with denials of eligibility, or Congress could go the other way and exempt IBR forgiveness from any tax implications - we just don't know.

I've talked to a couple of financial advisers about this, and they have danced around the question like it was radioactive. So I am extremely interested to see what folks' different opinions are or to see if there is any general consensus on the financially responsible path forward, not just for my situation, but for anyone in a similar scenario. With that, I thank you in advance and open it up to the floor.

personalfinance,Should I sell GOOGL stocks to pay off student loan?,"I have US$90k worth of GOOGL stocks, with no other significant assets (no mortgage, no car, renting).

I also have a student loan with US$90k remaining, to be paid over the next 8yrs (fixed term) with a variable interest rate that is currently 8.3% (6% fixed, 2.3% variable).

It is tempting to sell the stocks to pay off the loan. I know that I will pay tax on the stocks, and will therefore have to shell out more out-of-pocket to completely pay the loan off. I also know that it is impossible to know how GOOGL stocks will perform over the next 8 yrs, nor what changes may come to the variable component of the interest rate. I am hoping someone can help me figure out the likelihood of the GOOGL stocks out-performing the interest of the student loan.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

worldpolitics,Concentration of power,"In Syria, the military operation of Turkish troops called ""the Source of peace"" continues. In the Northern provinces of Aleppo, hasakah and raqqa are fierce fighting between Pro-Turkish and Arab-Kurdish forces. However, near Manbij is quiet, and even the us military is not going to leave the city, as happened in raqqa and hasakah. Apparently, therefore, the Turks curtailed the fighting in the area of Manbij.

Ankara's next military campaign in northeastern Syria was discussed at a meeting of the UN Security Council convened on the initiative of France. However, it was not possible to agree on a statement on the Turkish campaign. Following the meeting, the permanent representatives of several European countries called on Ankara to ""stop the invasion"" and immediately withdraw its troops. The US limited itself to a softer statement in the sense that the White house does not support Erdogan's actions. Note that the operation was coordinated with the United States. However, the US has previously stated its readiness to act as a mediator between all parties to the conflict. 

At the same time, France, Finland, the Netherlands and Germany have already imposed sanctions on Turkey, banning the sale of weapons. As we can see, the sanctions club of the West with special force begins to hit the objectionable in extreme conditions, when any restrictive measures taken after the fact, only cause an aggravation of the situation.

The Turkish President reacted harshly to the anti-war statements of a number of countries. And threatened to open the borders to Syrian refugees. For Europeans, Erdogan's statement was like a cold shower: if the Turkish warnings are fulfilled, all these millions may end up in Europe. The head of the European Council Donald Tusk did not think of anything better than to call Erdogan's words inappropriate blackmail, clearly forgetting, but rather, not wanting to remember how all the problems with the mass influx of forced migrants to Europe from the Middle East eight years ago began. And the Deputy official representative of the Cabinet of Ministers of Germany Ulrike Demmer expressed hope (!I hope that Ankara will continue to implement the agreement with the European Union on the placement of migrants in their country, which, we recall, were there not without the participation of the same EU.

Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in the North-East of the country has deteriorated sharply. 

The region is home to 95% of Syria's total oil and gas potential, including al-Omar, the country's largest oil field. Before the war, these resources produced about 387,000 barrels of oil per day and 7.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually and were of great economic importance to Damascus. Today, almost all existing Syrian oil reserves, estimated at 2.5 billion barrels, are located in the area occupied by the US government.

In addition to Syria's largest oil field, the US and its backers also control the country's largest Conoco gas plant. It can produce nearly 50 million cubic feet of gas per day. 

Another major asset is located in North-Eastern Syria, are water supplies. As you know, water in the Middle East is a resource of paramount importance. In the US-controlled part of Syria, there are three of the world's largest freshwater reservoirs, which are fed by the Euphrates river.

However, for all its importance to the United States, the destabilization of the government in Damascus is, I think, still an intermediate goal. The US strategic goal is Iran.

By blocking the route between Tehran and Damascus, the US will significantly weaken the positions of Syria and Iran and strengthen the positions of the US and its allies in the region. It is obvious that it is necessary for the further containment of Iran. Under such circumstances, there is no doubt that the US is not going to leave Syria, whatever trump says. Otherwise, Washington will finally lose its influence in the region, and American corporations will lose a source of significant income.

Bitcoin,9 reasons why you should have Bitcoin in 2019!,"1 / reliability

Bitcoin has been in the encryption market for a decade, suggesting that it may also exist forever. In addition, it has proven to be safe and reliable. Since its short suspension in 2013, it has been repaired very quickly and it has been running around the clock.

2/ Acceptability

Bitcoin is the most used cryptocurrency, and it is gradually becoming a household name. It is the oldest and recognized cryptocurrency in the world.

3 / Involvement of institutional investors

As the popularity of Bitcoin continues to increase, the number of regulations and bitcoin-based securities is also increasing. This will encourage more and more institutional investors to participate in order to stimulate greater adoption.

4 / Limited supply

Only 21 million bitcoins are available, and the number of bitcoins generated by the mining industry is reduced by half every few years. 80% of Bitcoin has been mined and will not be mined until 2140. This limited supply will increase demand in the future, which will also lead to price increases.

5 / No power to devalue it

Similar to the value of gold, the price of Bitcoin cannot be devalued by any authority like the Federal Reserve because it exists on a decentralized computer network and transcends national boundaries.

6 / Lightning Network

Bitcoin uses Lightning Networks to allow anyone to instantly conduct Bitcoin transactions at the lowest possible cost, while ensuring that no third party keeps your coins. The Lightning Network operates through a network of so-called payment channels. Currently, Bitcoin has 2,700 nodes, 9,000 channels, and a total capacity of 63 bitcoins.

7/ Global economic instability

While some countries are experiencing a crisis of statutory currency depreciation, the demand for bitcoin has been high. The worse the traditional economy, the better Bitcoin. The current instability in the world's financial markets is also a good idea of ​​why Bitcoin will soon be stacked.

8/ Anti-examination currency

Bitcoin uses Lightning Networks, which is located on a decentralized blockchain network and is more secure than legal and traditional currencies. In today's era, the demand for such a censored currency is also high.

9 / The correct time to buy Bitcoin

The Bitcoin market has experienced several market cycles, and since the same principles are applied in all of these cases, the price of Bitcoin is expected to improve, as is the case today. Therefore, it can be said with certainty that since the price of Bitcoin is at a lower level, this may be the best time to invest in them, because according to forecasts, Bitcoin will soon resume its bullish momentum.",cryptocurrency

We are looking to spend about 20-25k based on miles, features etc. We currently have $5500 saved as a down payment. I also expect to pay double the normal car payment each month as we have debt were paying off at the end of this month that will free up $500 each month that was set aside to aggressively pay that off. That would give us $500 + $300 we were saving each month for the car, for a total of up to $800 to throw at the car each month. I wont throw the whole amount but will instead probably just double the payment and put the rest into savings as were also saving for a house next year.

&amp;#x200B;

My question for /prersonalfinance is would getting a longer loan( 7 Years) on the car give us a lower interest rate and if so would it be a better option to do so encase we fall on hard times and can kick back to a lower payment over a 3 or 5 year loan. I expect to have this car paid off in 18-24 months depending on how aggressively we can pay it back, what our tax return is and how much childcare ends up eating into cretin budgets. 

I know longer loans are bad as you end up paying more in the long run over the seven year. But if i was planing on paying it all back in 2 years anyway would that matter? I'm mainly looking for the lower interest rate and emergency fall back of a lower payment if shit hits the fan.

btc,The possibility of fractional reserve banking in bitcoin,"Can we have fractional reserve banking in bitcoin?

On first glimpse, you would think that yes of course, why not. If or when bitcoin becomes world money, it will be stable, an interest rate will arise, and people would like to, just like now (or should I say before, lol, before the zero interest rate policy took hold), people would like to invest their savings. A deposit to a bank or a savings and loan institution, is a simple way to invest without having the knowledge required for a businessman, without the hassle, and without the risk (lower risk).

Let us have a quick look on current banking. Among other things, they take deposits, and lend money. 

Number one problem is that the deposits are mostly for on demand withdrawal, but the loans given are on a 3 month term, the bank can ask the money being paid back with a 3 month notice. 

The second problem is the loans can be almost as large as the deposits, only a fraction is left as reserve, giving the name fractional reserve. And with most money today being bank deposit money, it means that the loan that is paid out, and which is spent on stuff, is redeposited in the same bank, in another bank. Even if it is spent again, by the builder or whatever, sooner or later it comes back to a bank as deposit. Then it can be lent out again, less the fraction that is needed for the bank to have in reserve.

When repeated, a 10% reserve requirement means that the money is multiplied say 10 times as it takes its repeated roundabouts. This is why the central bank calls the base money ""high powered money""

There are also other mechanisms for the banks and their dealings with the central bank, but these two points should be enough for now. The rules are written by the bankers themselves of course, including the central bank.

The two points above, the mismatch in terms, and the fractional reserve, means that a bank in general is insolvent from the day it makes its first loan.

So why would anyone deposit into a bank, which is insolvent, and therefore take on a formidable risk with his savings?

At least two things come to mind, number one is the depositor insurance, in the USA called FDIC. Every depositor feels safe because of this, at least the small or normal depositors, they look at the insurance limit, and if the deposit is higher, they simply split their savings between two banks. But if you have time some day, you could take a look into the numbers, and you will see that 1) the amount of money is rather small, can probably not cover the failure of any bank except the smallest ones. Then 2) you could look at the type of the reserves they have, and you will see that it is bank deposits! This is the same in every country, the insurance is hardly real, it is more a ""trust us"" statement.

The other reason a bank would be trusted, is of course the backing of the central bank. Even if the insurance fund is small, you always have the central bank, which is said to be a lender of last resort. It can lend any amount of money to the banks, because they can print them at will. Sometimes they say exactly this on tv, but mostly they prefer people not to know or understand.

So what would be the difference with bitcoin? Firstly, bitcoins can not be printed at will. Secondly, (or basically for the same reason lol), the depositor insurance would not be trusted very much, unless it is way larger and have the form of bitcoins, not deposits. Then depositors would have to accept term deposits, else the bank would easily go bust and the bank capital would be lost. And yes, any depostitor would expect a larger bank capital to risk depositing.

So in all, the problem would be much smaller, and any bank directory would be ashamed if his bank is at risk of insolvency and the market discovers it.

For all these problems, it is the ability for the central bank to print more money that is the root cause. It can not happen when people use bitcoin in their day to day dealings and their savings, which is possible with one of the bitcoins btw, Bitcoin Cash",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Trading in two cars for one car loan, will this mess up my credit?","Hey, so I have a question. I financed my sister a car last year (Nov 2018) because she has three kids and it’s was starting to get cold out. It was a decent priced car $21k Infiniti Q50 that she’s been wanting. She was able to keep up with the payments but she’s going through hard times now and I’ve been worrying about if she can pay it recently (I do pay it if she’s not able to get her paycheck on time &amp; she pays me back later). I also have a car financed 2014 a4 with $11k left on the loan. If she’s not able to make payments in the future, is it possible for me to trade in both cars for one car loan?

gaming,Videogame Idea - Community focused game,"So this is a game idea that I have been thinking about for a very long time and I was wondering what people think of it.

My idea is this, a video game that is 100% player run with a wide variety of distinct roles that require cooperation. For instance, in this game players can create kingdoms, which have numerous towns/villages, with adventurers, farmers, item shops, smiths, healers, guards, traders, etc... the roles would be highly specialized, independent, and grind dependent and require interactions with each other to flourish. Unlike other games where EVERYONE an ADVENTURER who just happens to dabble in a profession, this game would have roles that are dedicated to specific tasks and play styles, with a large emphasis on a community. Since it is player-run, supply and demand would be essential to make the game run smoothly.

For example, a farmer may have monsters or (player) bandits and would make a quest in a guild for adventures to take. Adventures would require equipment, mana/health regeneration, items from other players. They would sell their goods in markets, bartering with other players. Guards would need to be hired to protect lands and even escort traders from town to town, or even across kingdoms. Players could even become bandits or criminals, which would require further police officers or judges. ALL of which run via players and not NPCs.

If there are too many adventurers and not enough support staff, prices would rise and incentivize players to focus more on life skills rather than adventuring. Or if too many players griefed, were bandits or criminals, demands for guards, police, and judges could rise.

I’m annoyed how other MMOs like WoW have elements of this, but ruin all source of community by forcing every character to be an ADVENTURER who just happens to also specialize in smithing or something, and who only interacts with NPCs rather than any human interaction (asides for raids or RARE instances).

Community is such a big part of video games that is so often undervalued and ignored. That’s why WoW classic was so popular at launch cause it forced player interaction on many levels that had been lost due to convenience. Imagine this but on steroids and I think it would be a hell of a lot of fun.

Other games do have aspects of this game, and I personally LOVE games that focus around a sense of community. Some examples are... Phantasy Star Universe (beta) although it was small and adventure-focused, players were very interactive and would join random lobbies, had a loud but active player trade hub, and would literally just sit around and talk with one another. Another game was Minecraft (Towny plug-in) where players made their own town, with lots of land for living, farming, and trading with mayors and builders. What originally started as a small village for me became a  massive city with various players who knew one another.

For those who watch anime, this is basically every video game isekai show, specifically Sword Art Online (which sucked but love the idea). Where players are placed in a videogame and have to live together, with not everyone being adventurers, but also shop keeps, bakers, guards, etc...

If implemented it would be a very difficult game to make, but I don’t think it’s impossible at all since all that’s needed are the tools to allow players to make the games themselves. It would be difficult to balance and tweak, and difficult to initially get situated, but once set into motion I think this could be one of the best games ever made if implemented properly.

Let me know what you guys think about this idea and give any feedback about it!

Economics,Literature Review on Sports Economics,"# Introduction

As part of my newfound hatred of professional football after last night (Lions Fan), I decided to throw a special project together, which hopefully can be a positive channeling of my anger and frustration. I took it upon myself to collect and categorize the recent literature (last 5 years) on 3 sports subjects of note. 

* First I look at some of the research surrounding sports stadium subsidies
* Next I look at mega-events (Olympics/World Cup/Super Bowl)
* Finally, I look at college athletes and compensation concerns legalistically and economically.

Hope you enjoy!

# Sports Stadium Subsidies

[St. Louis Fed; Wolla (2017](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2017-05-01/the-economics-of-subsidizing-sports-stadiums/))

**The Economics of Subsidizing Sports Stadiums**

&gt;Proponents say that subsidizing sports stadiums is justified because of the economic impact it will have on the community. First, sports stadiums are huge construction projects. In fact, they are often compared to the medieval cathedral in their attempt to dominate the skyline and inspire civic pride. And, like the cathedrals of old, they are expensive, massive building projects that require years of intensive labor. Proponents of a new stadium often laud the project's ability to generate new construction jobs. For example, the proposed stadium for the Los Angeles Rams in Inglewood, California, was predicted to cost $3 billion and add 22,000 construction jobs to the economy of Los Angeles, California.

/

&gt;In spite of all of these economic arguments, economists generally oppose subsidizing professional sports stadiums. When surveyed, 86 percent of economists agreed that ""local and state governments in the U.S. should eliminate subsidies to professional sports franchises."" Perhaps economists just do not like sports? Actually, many economists love professional sports—including former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, an ardent Washington Nationals fan. Rather, it is the provision of taxpayer money in the form of subsidies that economists generally oppose. In a 2017 poll, 83 percent of the economists surveyed agreed that ""Providing state and local subsidies to build stadiums for professional sports teams is likely to cost the relevant taxpayers more than any local economic benefits that are generated."" In their book, *Sports,* *Jobs, and Taxes*, Roger Noll and Andrew Zimbalist present a comprehensive review of stadium investments. In all cases, they find a new sports facility to have extremely small (or negative) effects on overall economic activity and employment. Furthermore, they were unable to find any facilities that had a reasonable return on investment. Sports economist Michael Leeds suggests that professional sports have very little economic impact, noting that a baseball team (with 81 regular-season home games per year) ""has about the same impact on a community as a midsize department store."" His research suggests that if every professional sports team in Chicago (including the Cubs, White Sox, Bears, Bulls, and Blackhawks) were to suddenly disappear, the economic impact on Chicago would be a fraction of 1 percent.

**Tax-Exempt Municipal Bonds and the Financing of Professional Sports Stadiums**

&gt;The evidence for large spillover gains from stadiums to the local economy is weak. Academic studies consistently find no discernible positive relationship between sports facility construction and local economic development, income growth, or job creation (Baim, 1994; Rosentraub et al., 1994; Baade, 1996; Zimmerman, 1996; Noll and Zimbalist, 1997; Coates and Humphreys, 1999, 2008; Siegfried and Zimbalist, 2000; Josza, 2003). Indeed, after 20 years of academic research on the topic, “Articles published in peer reviewed economics journals contain almost no evidence that professional sports franchises and facilities have a measurable economic impact on the economy” (Coates and Humphreys, 2008, p. 302). And as Siegfried and Zimbalist (2000, p. 103) put it, “Few fields of empirical economic research offer virtual unanimity of findings … that there is no statistically significant positive correlation between sports facility construction and economic development.”

/

&gt;In order to compute the net loss in federal tax revenues, suppose that the borrower issues $100 in bonds at the interest rate of 11.25 percent to the investor who faces an income tax rate of 25 percent. Since the interest rate on the taxable bond is 15 percent, the borrower saves $3.75 from the tax exemption and the federal government loses $3.75 in tax revenue. But now assume the borrower issues $100 in bonds at the interest of 11.25 percent to the investor who faces an income tax rate of 35 percent. The borrower still saves $3.75 from the tax exemption, but the federal government loses $5.25 in tax revenues. Thus, $1.50 of the tax break is not translated into a gain for the borrower, and is instead a windfall gain to the taxpayer in the higher tax bracket, reflecting an efficiency loss of the tax exemption. While all holders of tax-exempt debt benefit, tax exemption provides a larger benefit to high-income taxpayers (Galper et al., 2013).

/

&gt;The first row of Table 5 reproduces the last row of Table 4, reporting the total subsidy and revenue losses across all the stadiums using average yields for 20-year municipal bonds rated Aa by Moody’s Investors Service compared to average yields for seasoned corporate bonds rated Aa by Moody’s. We find that for these 45 stadiums, the total discounted value of the federal tax subsidy is $3.2 billion (using a 3 percent discount rate) or $2.6 billion (using a 5 percent discount rate). Given the inefficiency of the tax exemption, the lost revenue to the federal government exceeds the subsidy amounts, resulting in an estimated revenue loss of $3.7 billion (using a 3 percent discount rate) or $3.0 billion (using a 5 percent discount rate). The other rows of Table 5 compute estimates using alternative measures of bond yields for the municipal bonds and the comparable taxable bonds. The findings are fairly robust with respect to the indexes used.

/

&gt;Proponents of government subsidies for sports stadiums typically justify them on the grounds that stadiums provide spillover gains to the local economy. The evidence for these spillover gains is weak. Academic studies consistently find no discernible positive relationship between sports facility construction and local economic development, income growth, or job creation. Even if one believes, contrary to the empirical evidence, that the spillover benefits to the local economy justify subsidies, there still remains no economic justification for federal subsidies for sports stadiums.

[Journal of Policy Analysis and Management; Matheson (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/pam.22096)

**Is there a Case for Subsidizing Sports Stadiums?**

&gt;The case in favor of subsidizing large sports facilities is much harder to make than the one against. The peer-reviewed literature typically finds little or no evidence that the construction of new professional sports facilities results in significant in-creases in any type of measurable economic activity including personal income,wages, employment, tax revenues, or tourist spending (Coates &amp; Humphreys, 2008).In addition, the privately funded consulting reports that frequently accompany stadium proposals, and which invariably tout large economic benefits from subsidized stadiums and arenas, have been shown to suffer from significant theoretical flaws that make their conclusions suspect at best, and simply false at worst (Crompton,1995). In fact, some academic economists suggest, only partially in jest, that if one wants to know what the true economic impact of a stadium project will be, simply take whatever number the consultants project and then move the decimal point one place to the left.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, in specific circumstances, it may be possible to justify some level of public subsidies for the construction of sports venues. This should not be interpreted to mean that the optimal level of public spending is the roughly two-thirds of average stadium construction costs that taxpayers paid for during the period from 1990 through 2008 or even the roughly one-third of stadium construction costs that taxpayers paid for on average since the Great Recession in 2008. Rather, the only claim being made here is that the optimal level of funding may be higher than zero percent.

/

&gt;Stadiums and arenas can also serve as an anchor for local economic development.While the old construction model of a stadium as a “walled fortress surrounded by a moat of parking lots” clearly led to few neighborhood spillovers, modern arena construction has been much more successful at integrating stadiums into local,and recently more often than not, downtown neighborhoods (Baade, Matheson,&amp; Nikolova, 2007). While the data clearly show that stadiums and arenas do not typically lead to citywide increases in economic activity, there is strong evidence of localized impacts. Tu (2005), Feng and Humphreys (2012, 2018), and Propheter(2018) all find significant increases in real estate prices near stadiums, and many stadium projects such as PetCo Stadium in San Diego (Rosentraub, 2014), Rogers Place in Edmonton (Staples, 2015), and Barclays Arena in Brooklyn, have seen significant commercial and residential real estate development in the area of the stadium following facility construction. Indeed, some stadium deals may be better thought of as real estate developments with a stadium thrown in as opposed to the other way around \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, there may be real public policy or urban planning reasons to value one area in a city over another. It is commonly argued that vibrant and active downtown areas produce “unique and valuable intangible benefits for their cities” (Johnson et al., 2012). An economically healthy downtown provides a local identity, promotes the city’s image, enhances civic pride, and serves as a melting pot for differen traces, ethnicities, and socio-economic classes (Rosentraub, 2008). If viable central business districts are more valuable to a metropolitan area’s image and economic prospects than other locations in the area, it may make sense to spend public money to locate a stadium and its accompanying economic impact into a downtown location in order to boost that area even if income in the greater metropolitan region is unchanged.

/

&gt;Even under the most optimistic estimates, professional sports teams play a small role in the large, diverse economies in which they reside, and it is easy for the impact of sports to get lost in the natural variations of the local economy. Many studies of the impact of professional sports facilities that find no statistically significant impact of sports on tangible economic variables are under powered. This is particularly true of many of the older studies that relied on metropolitan area wide annual data (Coates&amp; Humphreys, 1999). Even if a new stadium were to inject tens or hundreds of millions of dollars into the economy, given the fact most major league cities sport gross domestic products well in excess of $100 billion, searching for such a “small”figure is akin to looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack.

/

&gt;It remains true that stadiums are typically poor public investments. Research in peer-reviewed journals finds little evidence that professional sporting franchises or events generate tangible new economic benefits for their cities. It would be exceedingly rare to find a sports facility project that would justify a public subsidy that would cover most of or all of the construction cost. However, the (absolutely true)claim that sports generate minimal economic benefits is not the same as claiming that sporting events, facilities, and franchises provide zero in net economic benefits for their host communities. And the same peer-reviewed literature that finds little evidence of tangible economic benefits in the form of increased income, wages, employment, and tax revenues also consistently finds positive public good benefits as measured by both contingent valuation and hedonic pricing methods.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, even if stadiums do not increase net economic activity or citywide societal welfare at all, the evidence is fairly clear that they can generate significant neighborhood effects, and policymakers may have good reason to make a conscious decision to prefer one area over another. Therefore, it may be possible to justify some level of public subsidies for the construction of sports venues. It is again crucial to reiterate that this should not be interpreted to mean that the optimal level of public spending is anywhere near what taxpayers in North America (and many places in the rest of the world) have paid for stadiums and arenas over the past several decades. Simply, one can make a reasonable economic argument that the optimal level of sports facility funding may be higher than zero percent 

# Mega Events

[Economic Affairs; Groothuis &amp; Rotthoff (2016)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2409985)

**The Economic Impact and Civic Pride of Sports Teams and Mega-Events: Do the Public and Professionals Agree?**

u/blurryk note: my quotes primarily address the non-stadium aspects of this paper, but it includes these as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Although there has been little or no evidence of an economic impact of having a sports team in a community, there is an argument that mega-events such as the Super Bowls, Olympics, and World Cups, have a positive impact on the economy of the megaevent host. It is argued that mega-events are expected to increase tourism, both current and future, as well as overall spending in the area. These events, however, may not have a positive impact if there is a crowding out effect where people who are not interested in the event avoid the area because of the large event. Crowding out might also occur if other non-sports sectors of the economy shut-down or are overcrowded because the event (Preuss 2011).  
&gt;  
&gt;Coates and Matheson (2011) find, from a panel of American cities from 1993- 2005, that mega-events generally exhibit little impact on rental prices on a given city as a whole. In addition, when an impact is found it is just as likely to reduce rental prices as increase them. Allmers and Maennig (2009) analyze the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup in France (1998), in Germany (2006), and in South Africa (2010). They find that the World Cups held in France and Germany have no evidence of creating positive impacts on tourism, employment, and income. They do speculate, however, that the potential benefits of the South Africa World Cup may have a different impact given the developing aspects of the country. These results are consistent with Baade and Matheson (2004), who did not find any positive economic effects for the World Cup held in the United States in 1994. Hagn and Maennig (2008a, 2008b) analyze the 1974 and 2006 World Cup in Germany, also detecting no positive economic impacts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Szymanski (2002) analyzes the world’s twenty largest economies over a thirty year period and find that growth in countries involved in the World Cup is significantly lower. Ritchie and Smith (1991) find that the worldwide name recognition of Calgary, after hosting the 1988 Winter Olympic, was positive but short-lived. In addition, Tiegland (1999) research shows that 40% of the full-serviced hotels in town went bankrupt after the 1994 Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer. Soberg and Preuss (2007) advise that hosting major sports events can boost tourism but the additional revenues might not cover the cost of investment by the host destination. Lastly, Preuss (2007) suggest that measuring the legacies of mega sport events on future tourism needs to account for how spending on sports venues may have crowded out spending on other tourist amenities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, the results of the economic impact studies suggest that sport teams and mega-events either have a small or no effect on the local economy. Politicians and team owners, however, still use the economic impact argument to justify public funds for sport arenas and events. In the next section, we discuss the civic goods benefits derived from sports teams and events.

/

&gt;Walton, Longo, and Dawson (2008) use the contingent valuation technique to measure the benefits of hosting the Olympics in London. Their results suggest that there are positive intangible effects associated with the event and residents outside of London are willing to pay toward the Olympic funding. In addition, Atkinson et al. (2008) discover that respondents from the cities of London, Manchester, and Glasgow are willing to pay £22, £12, and £11 per year (for 10 years) respectively for the 2012 Olympics. They also show that the willingness-to-pay for intangible impacts is in the region of £2 billion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, the results of the intangible benefits literature on sports teams and events suggest that public goods do exist and there is a benefit to the community. Most studies, however, find that the benefits of the team, facility, or mega-event are significantly smaller than the public funds provided. Politicians and team owners, however, use the concept of civic pride to justify public funds for sport arenas and events at higher levels than indicated.

/

&gt;One area that has been under studied is how this research informs public opinion. The research suggests that the public funds provided for sports teams, facilities, and events are greater than the benefits to the community. To analyze what people think, we developed questions for a national poll on sports: one survey on opinions about the Super Bowl and one about the Winter Olympics.

/

&gt;We find that most people do not know where the Super Bowl was going to be held but they do know the location of the Winter Olympics (The Super Bowl was held in Metlife Stadium at the Meadowlands; New York Giants/Jets Stadium which is located in northern New Jersey and the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia). We find that people who very closely follow sports, only 41% could name this year’s Super Bowl host while 96% could name the host of the Winter Olympics. Our results suggest that using a sporting event to put one city in the spotlight does not always occur unless it is a mega event such as the Olympics. When it comes to the Super Bowl, we find that people tend to be unaware or pay little attention to the city hosting the event. The Winter Olympics is such a major event that we find that nearly 70% of people who do not follow still know where the Winter Olympics were held.

/

&gt;We do find, however, 61% of people surveyed believe that a professional sports team improves the image of a city, which is consistent with the results from the civic pride literature. The results are similar for the Winter Olympics, where 63% of respondents believe that hosting an Olympics improves the image of the host country. These results suggest that individuals do feel civic pride from having a sports team or hosting a mega-event.

/

&gt;Our survey results of the general population in the United States shows that the majority of respondents conclude that local economic impact is not created by sports teams or mega events. The vast majority of the economics literature also concludes that local economic impact is not created by having a professional sports team or by hosting a major event. Our survey’s results are consistent with the economic literature findings on the effects of mega-events such as the Super Bowl or the Winter Olympics creating an economic impact.  
&gt;  
&gt;We find that both the general public and the researchers do not expected an economic impact from hosting the Super Bowl or Olympics are not beneficial to a local area. In addition, the majority of economic literature on civic pride concludes that sports teams and events do create intangible public good benefits, although less than a fully public subsidized event or area. Our survey also finds that people are of the same opinion that sports teams and events do create civic pride benefits. Our research suggests that the general public has become skeptical to the use of public funds to build sports stadiums or host mega events.

[Harvard Working Papers; Barrios, Russell, &amp; Andrews (2016)](https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/files/growthlab/files/cid_wp320_megaevents.pdf)

**Bringing Home the Gold? A Review of the Economic Impact of Hosting Mega-Events**

&gt;There is perhaps no larger sports policy decision than the decision to host or bid to host a mega-event like the FIFA World Cup or the Summer Olympics. Hosts and bidders usually justify their decisions by touting their potential impact. Many organizers and promoters either fund or widely disseminate ex-ante studies that tend to highlight the positive effects of the event. For instance, the consultancy firm Ernst &amp; Young produced a 2010 report prior to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil that painted an optimistic picture of the event’s potential legacy. It estimated that an additional R$ 142.39 billion (4.91% of 2010 GDP) would flow through the Brazilian economy over the 2010-2014 period, generating 3.63 million jobs per year, R$ 63.48 billion (2.17% of 2010 GDP) of income for the population and additional tax collection of R$ 18.13 billion (0.62% of 2010 GDP) for the local, state and federal governments. Ernst &amp; Young estimated that during the same period 2.98 million additional visitors would travel to Brazil, increasing the international tourist inflow up to 79%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Such results, if true, would clearly attractive for governments considering a bid, but these expected impacts don’t always materialize. Moreover, hosting mega-events requires significant investments - and the cost of these investments is rising. Zimbalist notes emerging economies like China, Brazil, and South Africa have increasingly perceived “mega-events as a sort of coming-out party signaling that \[they are\] now a modernized economy, ready to make \[their\] presence felt in world trade and politics” (Zimbalist 2015). Their intentions may be noble, but the intention of using mega-events as a “coming-out party” means developing countries hoping to host them need to make massive investments. They are confronted by significant obstacles in that they lack sufficient stadiums, accommodations, transportation systems, and other sports-related infrastructure. As a result, each of the mega-events hosted by emerging economies has been exorbitantly expensive. The 2014 World Cup cost Brazil between USD 15 billion and USD 20 billion, while Beijing reportedly spent USD 40 billion prior to the 2008 Summer Olympic (Zimbalist 2015). Additionally, as the debt-ridden 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal demonstrates, expensive mega-events are not limited to emerging economies alone. Flyvbjerg and Stewart have even shown that every Olympics since 1960 has gone over budget (Flyvbjerg and Stewart 2012).

/

&gt;An implicit assumption as to why these investments would lead to increased economic activity, is that the event would allow the host to access resources that otherwise wouldn’t be available. The rationale is that supranational organizations and certain private stakeholders would’ve simply chosen not to invest in the region in the absence of the event, or would have done so at a much smaller scale. Moreover, it is argued that political gridlock would’ve prevented available public resources to be effectively deployed in these infrastructure investments.  
&gt;  
&gt;The argument for increased economic activity also holds that infrastructure investments would presumably serve as an engine of growth for the local economy as the required construction activities demand direct and indirect inputs from other local industries, effectively creating a multiplicative effect throughout the economy. Furthermore, in the short run, these investments themselves would create additional employment in the local economy as these endeavors may require sizable labor. In turn, these new jobs might translate into new spending in the region, which would also generate a multiplicative effect throughout the economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, during the event itself, the assumption is that attendees, both locals and foreign tourists, will spend on tickets, merchandise and memorabilia related to the event. Similarly, it is expected that they also consume food and beverages in the arena. Lastly, it is assumed that the festive mood around the event would influence locals and visitors that are not necessarily attending the event, thereby increasing spending in other social and leisure activities more loosely associated to the event. Once again, this increased economic activity could presumably lead to new jobs and new spending in the region. Lastly, it is presumed that at least portion of the new jobs created due to the event are maintained over time, allowing for the increased level of economic activity to persist long after the event has occurred.

/

&gt;In general, the assumption that “new” external resources become available when hosting an event appears to be rather limited since any “new” external resources are routinely dwarfed by complementary public investments. Furthermore, these public investments are generally financed through additional debt commitments, not necessarily through existing “politically clogged” resources. This likely implies tax hikes or budget cuts down the road. Therefore, it appears that mega-events will only be beneficial if the purported net benefits surpass those of alternative publicly financed projects. The main exception to this finding might stem from a distributional argument in which host cities stand to benefit from cross-subsidization by national or regional governments.

/

&gt;Another assumption is that the investments associated to the event will generate a multiplicative effect across the economy (primarily through additional jobs creation), but there are reasons to believe that this effect may also be overstated. To start the economic multipliers used in most ex-ante analyses are calculated using complex input-output tables, that assume specific inter-industry relationships within regions and are based upon an economic area’s normal production patterns. However, as Matheson (2009) argues during mega-events, these inter-industry relationships may not hold, rendering the multipliers highly inaccurate.  
&gt;  
&gt;For instance, the organization of these events is a major endeavor that may require productive resources vastly superior to local supply. It is unlikely that existing capacity would be able to sustain previous construction activity while at the same time handling the additional work associated with specialized multi-billion dollar projects. Either existing resources would need to be re-prioritized from other construction (which at best entails a zero net impact on the economy) or, more likely, substantial part of the work would be outsourced from the local economy, implying an outflow of money away from the region.

/

&gt;Baade and Matheson (2002) examine job creation associated to the 1984 and 1996 Olympics. They find that if all unexplained increases in employment were attributed to these events (a substantial assumption on its own right) then the 1984 Olympics led to 5,000 new jobs during the year of the event and the 1996 Olympics led to a cumulative increase of somewhere between 3,500 jobs and 42,000 jobs during the 1994-96 period. This latter estimate not only demonstrates a large degree of uncertainty but also shows that, even in the most optimistic scenario, the potential job creation is roughly half of the 77,000 originally predicted by the Atlanta Olympic Organizing Committee.  
&gt;  
&gt;Similarly, Feddersen and Maennig (2010a) use highly localized data to find no positive effects from the 2006 World Cup in Germany on employment. This is consistent with a previous finding from Hagn and Maennig (2009) that the effect on unemployment in the twelve match venues of the 2006 World Cup isn’t significantly different from zero2. Finally, Hagn and Maennig (2008) did not find evidence that the 1974 World Cup in Germany generated employment effects positively different from zero in the host cities in the short term or long term. These findings also hold for other major football events outside of Germany. For instance, Baumann, Engelhardt and Matheson (2012) found no statistically significant increase in employment in the cities that hosted the 1994 United States World Cup \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Hotchkiss, Moore and Zobay (2003) presented one of the few studies in which the expected impact was surpassed by the actual impact. The authors found that areas that hosted the 1996 Atlanta Olympics experienced a growth of 293,000 jobs, significantly higher than the previously mentioned 77,000 jobs. Nonetheless, when considering employment growth in Atlanta and the surrounding areas, this was just 0.2 percent higher than would have been expected for the 1991-96 period. Additionally, the authors did not found any significant effect on wages. Furthermore, Feddersen and Maennig (2009) attempted to confirm these findings and address some methodological concerns with their approach. The authors find that, after adjusting the specification to correct for potential distortions in the original model, the existence of a positive Olympic effect is no longer clear and could not be confirmed.

/

&gt;Allmers and Maennig (2009) examined the effects on retail sales from the 1998 France World Cup and the 2006 Germany World Cup but failed to find any statistically significant impact. Along the same lines, Porter and Fletcher (2008) studied the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games and the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympic games and found no significant impacts on taxable sales.  
&gt;  
&gt;Similarly, Baade, Baumann and Matheson (2005) conducted a detailed regression analysis of taxable sales in the state of Florida in the United States between 1980 and 2005 to estimate the impact of large scale sporting events on economic activity.

/

&gt;These studies agree that the impact of mega-events through retail sales is not statistically significant. However, these findings might seem counterintuitive given the level of activity that is usually perceived around these major sporting events, a perception that is taken as a fundamental assumption for ex-ante studies. Matheson (2006) argues that there are three theoretical limitations to these ex-ante assumptions: the substitution effect, crowding out and leakages. Of these, the substitution effect and crowding out limitations might be particularly useful to make sense of the counterintuitive results with respect to sales.  
&gt;  
&gt;The substitution effect occurs when individuals in the local economy spend money on a mega-event rather than in other goods and services. It is likely that individuals have a limited budget determined prior to the event destined towards entertainment and leisure. When they spend on the mega-event, they re-allocate it from other activities. Even when some individuals reallocate from other parts of their budget towards mega-event consumption, it is unlikely that overall savings rate of the local economy will change as a by-product of the event. Hence, rather than a significant increase in taxable sales, what is likely to occur is a redistribution of existing local sales.

/

&gt;Given the lack of substantial evidence to back-up the claim of impact on short-term direct or indirect revenues, it is unlikely that there would be evidence to substantiate sustained long-term impacts on this front. In fact, there are not many studies that tackle this question.  
&gt;  
&gt;von Rekowsky (2013) reviewed this sparse literature on mega-events between 1990 and 2010 and found no meaningful lasting economic benefits as a by-product of hosting the event. The author posits that one potential explanation for this might be that mega-events investments do not tend to tackle the underlying binding constraints limiting growth; hence it is unlikely to significantly alter the long-term outlook of the host region.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lastly, Billings and Holladay (2012) analyzed the long-term impact of hosting mega-events for all Summer Olympics between 1956 and 2004. The authors controlled for the selfselection of cities that host these types of events by using a difference-in-difference methodology leveraging other finalist cities as a control group. After this, they don’t find any statistically significant long-term impact on measures of real GDP per capita. In this case, the authors argue that host cities likely lose any potential long-term benefits during the competitive bidding process as the investments required to win a bid and costs associated to carry out the preparation might be larger than the purported benefits. It should be noted that even though in the aggregate these investments and expenditures seem to do away with the potential benefits, some investments associated to the event might have potential positive impact (i.e.: improved transportation). Further research on this might be beneficial for policy purposes.  
&gt;  
&gt;While there aren’t many studies on the long-term impact of mega-events, the few that are available do not provide evidence that these events have a positive long-term effect on economic activity. Furthermore, these studies tend to argue that the investments and expenditures carried out in preparation of the event seem to outweigh the benefits and do not tackle structural constraints of the economy, hence tend to be on average unproductive investments.

/

&gt;The literature signals that potential hosts should be very suspicious of deriving any benefits from hosting major sporting events. In practice, the verifiable positive impacts associated to mega-events fall way short of the lofty expectations that are generated in the early planning stages. In handful of cases where these positive impacts do appear, they tend to be conditional on other factors and are mostly temporary in nature.  
&gt;  
&gt;As we outlined before, ex-ante expectations tend to be overly optimistic and, in many cases, structurally flawed. If taken at face value, they can lead policymakers to believe that the benefits of hosting a mega-event are orders of magnitude larger than they likely are in reality. From the previous review, we find that in a strict expense versus income calculation, the math doesn’t add up for potential hosts. Non-operational costs and investments associated with hosting mega-events have been increasing exponentially in the past few decades. Now, public investment dwarfs both event revenues and resources that were theoretically previously inaccessible.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ex-ante studies might claim that this limitation is not necessarily binding since, through a multiplicative effect, the mega-event investments positively influence the broader host economy. However, these multiplicative effects are routinely overestimated. The acrossthe-board increases in economic activity and employment generally predicted by these exante studies are not validated by ex-post evaluations.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are, however, some positive benefits to be reaped with respect to tourism, but these are conditional on a number of factors (i.e.: peak season, type of event, participants in the event, etc.). Moreover, they are heavily concentrated in the few years before and after the event with little to no long-term effect. Furthermore, it is rather unlikely that these temporary improvements in awareness, perception and visitor growth justify the substantial investments associated with hosting a major sporting event. Lastly, it is worth questioning if hosting mega-events is a more effective mechanism to promote tourism than direct investment in the sector.  
&gt;  
&gt;These types of caveats are similar to most, if not all, of the purported benefits of these types of events. There is generally little evidence to substantiate them. When there is an impact, it either falls way short of expectation, is small relative to the cost, or appears less effective than alternative policy options for addressing the same goal.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Former CFTC Chairman Giancarlo WSJ Op-Ed Arguing for U.S. CBDC,"We Sent a Man to the Moon. We Can Send the Dollar to Cyberspace

## Washington should edge out rivals with a regulated platform for trading greenbacks via blockchain.

By J. Christopher Giancarlo and Daniel GorfineOct. 15, 2019 6:52 pm ET 

America was complacent about its technological dominance until the Soviets’ 1957 Sputnik launch woke us up. Recent developments in digital currencies similarly threaten the dollar’s dominance, and Washington policy makers are taking notice.

Significant actors, including central banks and social-media platforms, may launch new currencies in the next few years. As their networks grow, they could eventually erode the dollar’s status as the most popular currency for international exchange. Incidents like the attempts of foreign states and companies to circumvent U.S. sanctions show the growing demand for exchange systems outside the U.S.-led world currency regime.

Such a shift would mean trouble for the U.S. Since World War II and the decline of the British pound sterling as the backbone of global trade, the U.S. has benefited from sponsoring the world’s primary reserve currency. Guiding the global economic order has helped the U.S. stabilize prices of food and energy, sustain low borrowing costs for home and business loans, combat illicit finance, drive global demand for U.S. government debt and promote commerce.

The emergence of unchecked rival systems could undermine these benefits. Whether a network of Beijing-dependent states trading a digital yuan or a commercial venture’s token backed by a basket of global currencies, a challenger to the U.S. dollar could end the delicate world economic order Americans have long taken for granted. Complacency in the face of this threat risks lasting damage to the U.S. economy.

We propose a digital dollar—a government-sanctioned blockchain protocol, created and maintained by an independent nongovernmental group but administered by banks and other trusted payment organizations. Cash brought into the system would be exchanged for digital U.S. dollars on a blockchain, with the cash lodged in special escrow accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve.

The system could start with a pilot program: People could use their preferred provider’s smartphone app to buy digital dollars, then use them in daily transactions. This mechanism could ultimately digitize the dollar in both domestic and international transactions.

What are the benefits of this system? This new payment network would still rely on trusted, regulated intermediaries to maintain digital wallets and validate transactions. But it would also let individuals, companies and states tap the potential advantages of distributed-ledger payments, such as much higher transaction speed, enhanced access and greater transparency. This should mean lower costs for businesses and consumers and new economic models based on real-time transactions and micro-payments.

Security would be another major advance. Because no individual validator of the payment ledger would hold complete information regarding all payments, the system would solve some of the privacy and antitrust concerns that arise when a single intermediary—like [WeChat](https://quotes.wsj.com/TCEHY) or a foreign central bank—holds complete information.

Most important, compared with a private or foreign digital currency, this system would extend the central role of the U.S. dollar in global finance and allow it to compete confidently in the new digital era. The first major digital-currency initiative to draw American users would be fully and unequivocally backed by the greenback.

This new digital-currency regime would require the support and participation of key actors including the Fed, along with the commercial banks, nonbank intermediaries, technology innovators and social-media platforms. Its independent protocol would prevent conflicts of interest, deploy the best available technology and gradually expand the network to more participants, both foreign and domestic.

No perfect solution exists to address the challenges and promises of digital currency, nor can anyone predict all the technological advances these efforts will generate. The same was true when President Eisenhower proposed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and when President Kennedy vowed to put a man on the moon. America must once again establish a team of the world’s brightest minds, this time to update a global economic order that ensures our freedom and prosperity.

solar,Need help - Considering Solar Panels,"Hi, new to sub, but not exactly new to panels.  I'll try to make it brief.

In the military (so obviously I move every 2-4 years).  I bought a house in SC and solar guy came around; agreed to a solar lease type deal in 2016 (yuck, I know, I was a newb); panels produced 60% of energy and yearly rate raised 3% each year.  Was still pleased with clean energy and a set bill.

Time came around to sell house, had a LOT of angst trying to get buyers to bite off on panels and assuming lease, but ended up successfully selling house and transferring loan.  Realtor was very discouraging about solar panels and was a huge source of anxiety about not being able to find buyers.  Decided that I probably won't do that again.

Bought house this July in a very popular neighborhood when I transferred to FL (a max 2 year billet); I'm obviously a sucker for punishment.  It's old, 1939 construction, and it's balls hot here, so I have the AC on a turd-ton.  I remodeled a little side building to act as a studio airBnB for extra income.  People have the AC on in the building all the damn time (understandably).

My electric bill last month was $260 for a 1200 sqft house, with 1741w used.  Previous month, it was $183 for 1491w.  Gulf Power was bought out by Florida Southern or some shit, who is owned by NextEra Energy, one of largest utility companies in US.  A bit nervous about that.  They already increased the rate 8% last month.

Solar guy comes around with $40k system, 0% down loan, 3.99% interest rate on a 15kw system for 20 years.  Would get $12k back in federal credit.  My monthly payment would be $175 (assuming I pay the $12k credit to the loan).

It sounds really awesome, but I am reluctant about taking on solar again when it is very likely that I would sell or rent out my place once I leave.

I get mixed reviews when I talk to professionals--obviously solar guy wants the sale, but realtors do not understand and are reluctant to give me concrete info about selling or renting a property with a solar loan attached.  I am on the fence; I'd love to do this, but I don't know if it would be worth it for the two years I'm here (and if I rent the property out, would people be willing to pay an additional $200 for set electricity per month?).  How do I sell it to myself and/or potential tenants (or buyers if I sell in 5 years)?

Any thoughts?  

Thank you guys for your time!",energy
personalfinance,Refinancing mortgage twice with different terms?,"I was considering a mortgage refinance with a considerable reduction in rate.  It's clearly a good idea.  But as I was reviewing the various offers, I got to thinking:

Some terms offer higher interest rates with substantial credits, while others offer lower interest rates, for an upfront fee (paying ""points"").  Is there anything to stop refinancing first at a high interest rate for a large credit, then re-refinancing for a lower rate, and then pocketing the difference (or covering the cost of a lower interest rate's points)?  I understand that the multiple refinance may have a negative impact on a credit score, but let's say there is $10 or $20k of potential credits on the line?

The interest on the 401K loan is 6% compared to 24.9-36% on the cards. Using that loan to reduce overall credit usage would also boost our scores and qualify us for better interest rates on future cards and loans.  


Would you talk me out of this or is it a sound plan?   


Gains on the 401K are paltry right now and probably not going to skyrocket during the life of an 18-month loan. Also, contributions will still be made during the loan period.",finance

I have about 26k in student loans, and want to figure out how much I should pay each month.  Part of me wants to get rid of it ASAP, but another part of me wants to hold off so I can save a bit.  Some background: 

- Salary is 150k, net about 4k bi-weekly 
- about 1k in savings at the moment (so that needs to change lol)
- owe 26k in federal student loans, approx. 6% interest 
- have pretty low cost of living (a little over 700 a month in rent)

My initial thought was keep payments low until i have comfortable savings, and then ramp up payments.",finance
personalfinance,36/m need help with directing retirement with a job switch to Federal Government,"I will be switching from a career in State Government (PA) to the Federal Government.   I never had to really think much about my retirement with the State, as the pension plan is absurd if you retire from the State - you basically get near your highest 3 earning years, averaged, per year.

I have been with the state 13 years, and am vested, so I will still take my pension at age 55 (when I am eligible), which equates to around $1,800-$2,000/month (no COLA throughout), pending which I option I go with.  To me, this is not enough to retire on comfortably, so bridging the gap with my new job is what I am seeking advice on.

With the Federal Government, I will be making roughly $96,000/year (fairly sizable increase for me) before taxes to start.   I am married, and my wife makes around the same (lets say, $100K), and she has a 401k.  

I would like to retire with a similar type of lifestyle we have now.   We have no large debts outside of a mortgage ($1,750/mo, with 26 years left), and 1 car payment ($375/mo). Currently have 1 child, and perhaps looking to have one more (both would be in daycare).  

The Federal Government offers a 3-pronged approach for retirement:

\-Federal annuity:   .01 x your high-3 x all years and full months of service.  Essentially if I retired at a final average of $100k, after 25 years (age 61), that would equate to $25,000/year or $2,083/month just as an example.  To my understanding this gets COLA after age 62.     There is an incentive that boosts the multiplier up to .011 if you retire at 62 or later (26 years for me).   

\-Social security

\-Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), which is similar to a 401K, and the government will match up to 5%

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are as follows:

1.)  Obviously I match the 5% of the TSP right?  This seems like a no brainer, and is free money essentially.  

2.) What type of vehicle do I invest my money in outside of the Fed retirement package?  This is the real bridge I will be looking at to fund the gap between my annuities.  I was looking at the Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 Fund (VFIFX).  Should I do this, something similar, or am I way off base here?

3.)  Currently have a 457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan with the State.  Would I just roll that money into the above?   

&amp;#x200B;

I know a little about retirement, but not a lot, and am just looking for confirmation that I am doing the right thing, or advice that I'm totally off base and to need direction of what way to go.

personalfinance,Looking at Refinancing Mortgage - 4.375% down to 3.75%,"I am looking at refinancing my mortgage since rates are lower now than when I bought in Summer 2018. Also my credit score has improved since then. 

I currently owe $403k on my existing 30-year fixed rate mortgage at an interest rate of 4.375%. After shopping around a bit I am seeing that I can get a rate of 3.75% on a 30-year fixed with total closing costs of $1600. 

This is a no-brainer right? I am seeing that I will save roughly $200 per month in interest paid over the first year, so this should pay for itself in less than a year. 

Is there any downside I am not seeing or any reason to think I shouldn't move forward with this? We plan to be in this house 5-10 years. I'm not really worried about reducing my overall mortgage payment, but mainly just want to pay less interest over the life of the loan.

(Bloomberg) -- China caught traders off-guard with a surprise injection into the financial system via loans to banks, ahead of data on Friday which is expected to show a further slowdown in the domestic economy.

The People’s Bank of China added 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) of one-year cash through the medium-term lending facility on Wednesday. It kept the interest rate steady. The move took traders by surprise as the authorities usually inject liquidity when previously offered loans come due, and the next batch won’t mature until Nov. 5.

The Chinese economy has been under pressure amid a prolonged trade dispute with the U.S. and a slowing domestic economy, prompting the central bank to ease monetary policy by lowering corporate borrowing costs and cutting banks’ reserve ratios this year. Data released this week showed that China’s factory deflation deepened and imports and exports fell last month.",finance

cybersecurity,Hiding the existence of PCIe DMA device from the operating system,"**(TL;DR; at the bottom but I appreciate if you read)** As you know, PCIe devices can do DMA operations. Now, imagine that a PCIe device is installed into the target system to examine a malware (not sure if this is a stupid idea btw). A really high-end malware can hide its operations if a rogue PCIe device is installed. DMA operations can be detected by examining (AFAIK):

* hardware performance counters
* increased PCIe bus activity
* increased interrupt signals
* or by simply checking the existence of a ""rogue"" device. I mean, the device and vendor ID can be spoofed by flashing the device firmware but a legit looking driver (with all the digital certificates (code signing certificates) from big companies such as Intel, nVidia, AMD, Qualcomm etc) cannot be installed for the device in the operating system.

These are not the only detection vectors, I guess. Learning those detection vectors is one of the reason that I create this thread. These detection vectors might be bypassed by overcoming timing attacks explained in the following research papers (i.e. extremely interesting resources about detecting hardware level malware):

* ""Detecting Peripheral-based Attacks on the Host Memory"" [https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/4494/1/stewin\_patrick.pdf](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/4494/1/stewin_patrick.pdf)
* ""Can Hardware Performance Counters be Trusted?"" [http://www.cse.chalmers.se/\~mckee/papers/iiswc08.pdf](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~mckee/papers/iiswc08.pdf)

**TL;DR;** So, my question is: Can BIOS theoretically and practically hide the existence of PCIe DMA device from the operating system? The device will enumerated by BIOS just fine and normally at boot but some mechanism built into BIOS will prevent the device from be visible to the operating system. Is this possible?",technology

personalfinance,TurboTax Accuracy Guarentee,"I'm wondering if anyone has successfully filed a claim through TurboTax due to their accuracy?

I received a notice that our 2016 state taxes were audited, and our income was under-reported. We filed our taxes through TurboTax. I filed jointly with my husband. Our Federal tax return has our total combined income (say $100,000) but our state tax return only has my income ($50,000), so we owe state taxes on the additional $50k. 

I understand that at the end of the day it's my responsibility to look at the information and make sure it's accurate, and will of course pay the taxes on the unreported income. But I don't understand why both our W2s weren't included in the state tax return. I downloaded our return from TT, and the top line has Total Federal Wages as 100k, but line 5 for Income is $50k. From using TurboTax the past few years, they import your federal tax information into your state tax return, it doesn't need to be manually entered as it does for the federal. I was curious if anyone had similar experience with TurboTax, or gone through the process of filing a claim, as that may be my next step.",finance

personalfinance,Do I need a Financial Planner?,"I've read the wiki and tried to search this forum, but this is still all really going over my head. I'll include some background information about me below and would love any advice you can give, but it's very likely I'll still need help.

From my searching, it sounds like I actually want a Fiduciary and likely one that works at a brokerage firm like Fidelity, Vanguard, and Charles Schwab. But what I want is a human being who can walk me through Retirement planning and give me advice on where to go. My family is of 0 help and my friends are in no better shape than I am.

About me:
I'm 39. I'm single with no dependents. I work for the Federal Government and currently maxing my Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) contribution at 15% (fed matches 5%), which is the equivalent to a pre-tax 401k. I have about $130,000 in total so far and 100% of that is going into the 'G' fund. I also have about $15,000 in a 401k from a prior employer but I haven't been able to figure out how to roll that money into my TSP.

I have about $40,000 in my savings account with the plan to sink $10,000 of that into an investment plan (which is why I want the Fiduciary or Financial Planner). I have a mortgage with 23 years remaining. I make $2000 every 2 weeks and $1.5k a month is used for mortgage, bills etc. Another $1.5k goes toward monthly expenses (I eat out often but that will need to stop).

Future large purchases include a car, as my car will be dead within 6 months. I also need to 2 rennovations on my home, one of which is a Kitchen that I have not received quotes for but it will likely be in the $20-30k range.

That's about it. I can answer any questions you guys may have, but I really just need someone to point me in a direction. Should I change anything with the above? Is it as simple as me going to Vanguard/Fidelity/Schwab website and speaking with someone?

personalfinance,Question about student loan refinancing options,"Hi all and thanks in advance for your input. I currently have $251,000 in **graduate school debt** with **6.8%** average interest. I'm starting a job next week where **I make $190,000 plus $15,000 bonus**. This increases every year: 200k, 220k, 255k, 280k. Bonus increases as well: 25k, 50k, 65k, 80k. Most people don't stay at the employer for longer than 5-7 years at most. I have **no savings**. **Rent** is $2675/mo.

I'm currently weighing options for refinancing. I can refinance with First Republic for a **3.30%** interest rate for a 7 year repayment or **3.95%** for a 10 year repayment. However, I'd have to have 10% of the loan in savings, so I'd need $25k in savings before refinancing with them. Alternatively, I could refinance with CommonBond for **4.12%** 7 year plan or **4.65%** 10 year plan.

I'd like to contribute max to my 401k ($19,000), my IRA, and my health savings account. So **I'm wondering if it's worth** it to take the higher interest CommonBond refinance so I don't have to build up $25k in savings before making contributions, or whether I should just focus on building savings immediately in order to take advantage of the First Republic refinancing?

personalfinance,Our student loan kicks in next month $1250 and I don’t know how we will pay it.,"Husband is $75,000 in student debt for his undergraduate degree because he’s an international student.

We got married and he has a green card. His APR is 8.8% and our debt is growing faster than we can pay it off because of the high interest rate. 

I want to refinance but because he doesn’t have a degree we cannot. His green card is conditional (2years) because we just got married in 2017.

He hasn’t gotten a degree yet because he’s forced to take 12 months off of school to pay state tax. The whole thing fucked up his tuition. Lost his scholarship and health insurance because his status changed from international student to Wisconsin state resident. Regardless he has to take 12 months off school to pay taxes. People ask if he can take classes online, part time, at a tech school. The answer is no. We asked multiple people and there are no loopholes. We totally fucked ourselves to get him here legally.

We have no collateral, I’m 21 and he is 20 years old. We have a co-signer but we were told that if their name goes on anything we have to disclose all of our purchases to them as well as not let my husband travel to see his family.

TLDR:

My life sucked growing up and I had to learn how to really take care of myself on my own. What really kills me is that everyone else around me seem to absolutely adore me but the people who I really sought the most approval from and the people that should’ve been there for me most throughout these years did nothing but make it worse. I was a good student, got into a really good college, had an internship throughout high school but despite all that I was seen as a vermin to my biological dad and step mother who I lived with. Maybe that was because I only met my biological dad when I moved to the united states when I was 10 years old but despite that I believe if they truly cared they would’ve made it work. After All I wasn’t a bad kid at all, barely left the house as I was not even given the privilege till 15-16 years old. All there was to do was read, play computer games, do school work and practically do all of the house chores while also babysitting my several younger siblings. Thankfully I was never starved of food or basic necessities but emotionally and physically, I would have been taken out of there in an instant had I had the guts to look for help. I was even scared of attempting suicide and failing as what could come absolutely terrified me. After Looking back towards all this I really should’ve sought for help much earlier and my life may have been much different with much less suffering but I made it out, and if anything I learned important life skills that made me the person who I am today. Financially however, I still have a lot to learn. I ended up being kicked out a few weeks after graduating in June this year and had to survive on my own.

////

What's really pushing me to ask for help now is the fact that I won't be able to register for spring classes unless I pay off the amount that I owe the school($2688). This would not only put me out of school but also out of a place to live as well. I can register for classes if I am able to get it to under $1000 before the start of classes next semester which would be sometime in January. I really would be able to figure that out and pay it off but there’s a lot more associated with this that I really need to figure out also.

I had a credit card I was using prior to being kicked out and had some decent credit. Living on my own during the three months leading up to college, I was extremely stupid. I stayed with a friend for about a week after moving out and then got a small room in my city, I live close to the boston area. I also thought up a ‘great plan’ to supplement my current job(still internship). I would lease out a car and use it to do food delivery during nights/weekends. This did not work out at all. My paycheck went directly to rent and lease(of which I still owe from the lease I managed to get out of after realizing it would be impossible to pay especially in college) and I fed myself with credit cards that I opened all at about the same time before I tanked my credit. I did not eat or manage my money at all. Now all three are maxed out, the one I had prior and the two that I later opened(one $1000 and two $500+fees). As well as a dell financial account that I used to purchase my laptop that I am now using for college.

So I am 2 months late on the latest payment for my oldest card, and really can’t keep paying any of them as well as the lease which racks up debt fees very quickly.

personalfinance,"From annual interest to monthly, divide by 12 or take the 1/12th root?","Hello,

I have trouble understanding how should one calculate the monthly interest rate if the annual interest rate is known. I figured a lot of knowledge lurks here, so could some helpful soul explain this to me, please.

&amp;#x200B;

The following is from GMAT example:

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*If $600,000 is invested at 12% annual interest compounded monthly, what  will be the total value of the investment after one quarter of the year?*

*A. $672,000.00*

*B. $624,362.41*

*C. $618,180.60*

*D. $618,000.00*

*E. $606,000.00*

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Only answer that makes sense here is the C; because supposedly the monthly interest rate is 12%/12m -&gt; 1%/month.

So,

1st month interest - 600,000 \* 1% = 6,000

2nd month interest - 606,000 \* 1% = 6,060

3nd month interest - 612,060 \* 1% = 6,120.6

Total interest comes out 18,180.6, in which case the total investment will be 600,000 + 18,180.6 = 618,180.6

&amp;#x200B;

However, I don't get why the monthly interest rate isn't...

1.12\^(1/12) - 1 = 0.009488792... \~ 0.9488%

In which case the total investment would be 600,000 \* (1+ 0.009488792)\^3 (three months in a quarter) = 617,242.41",finance

personalfinance,Reasonable merit increase request range.,"I'm trying to advise my wife on what would be a reasonable merit increase for her yearly raise. Her employer regularly provides COLA but I don't believe she's received or asked for anything above that in at least the last few years.

I know increases can start to taper at different salary ranges and role/industry, so I'm hoping anyone with relevant experience can chime in.

- Current base compensation is $170,000 - $180,000.
- In an implementation role at a Software company leading in their field. Has been with the company and in role for &gt;10 yrs.

She is well respected and from what I gather is valued as an expert on the system/components she is primarily assigned to, she is regularly staffed on 2-3 customers in a given year with ~60% to 70% travel, although that has gone down to around %50 the past year or two.

My thought was to suggest negotiating for 2.5% to 4% on top of COLA, depending on how she assesses her value-add.  Any thoughts?",finance

Over the past 3 months I noticed that when I'm on the wifi I completely lose cell phone network after streaming for 10 - 15min. I had the note 8 and thought it was a phone issue. Recently got the note 10plus and same issue. Stream youtube for 10 - 15 min, cell phone network disappears, no inbound or outbound calls. I have to restart the phone to get coverage back. I got fed up an gave my note10 to Roger's to service. Roger's gave me a lender phone Sony xperia. After a day or 2 of using that same issue. So I determine it being the router. It must be blocking network in my room/ upstairs.

Just got my note10 back n Roger's said no issues found on the phones end.

So I want to replace my router, preferably move away from d-link, what brand would be worth buying?

personalfinance,Im 21 years old and ready to move out. But my mother offered to put me on the mortgage to get me to stay.,"I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dhl2mw/wibta_if_i_moved_out/) situation in r/amitheasshole yesterday. This is an update of that, but fits better in this subreddit and i need more professional advice. Read original post first.

So after the Judgement from the previous post, i told my mother i would be moving out with kat. She was upset but came back with a counter offer. If i stay she will put my name on the mortgage. I dont know if this is a good idea or not. Im currently planning on saving up and buying a duplex to live in one half and rent out the other.

Obviously i would go over the paperwork first, but these are the numbers shes claiming:

She assumes 80k in equity (mostly through renovations and appreciation) looking at similar houses in the area this is seems to be somewhat accurate.

5 years into the loan original loan was for ""just under 80k""

Interest rate ""around 4%"" (idk how she doesnt know this)

In the case its sold i get half the equity. In the case she dies i get 75% as 25% would go to my brother.

I would take on half the mortgage payment. So about $350 per month plus half of the utilities.

Other terms:

She has a little over 10k in credit card debt. I would have to help her pay this down 

She and my brother are going to be living in there for the foreseeable future, so i cant rent it out other than to my girlfriend, which we dont really wanna do.

Likely cannot tap into equity for around 10 years

&amp;#x200B;

My first reaction was to tell her im skeptical and she got upset again and went on saying how good of a deal it was and id be dumb to turn it down and said if i didnt take it she would offer it to my brother, (who is terrible with money and likely would miss payments) which makes me ever more on edge about it

My credit score is currently 630. Job#3 is military reserves. I currently use a motorcycle as my primary mode of transportation, but the weather (snow is coming) is going to force me to either use public transit (expensive and unreliable where I live) or finance a vehicle. 

My landlord is family, and the $800 balance is from a year ago when I was unable to make rent for a couple months due to a layoff. He is not charging me interest, but I would like to pay it off as a matter of good faith.

I am about to receive about $5500 in backpay. I currently have $1550 in an online high yield (2%) savings account as my emergency fund. I would like to grow that emergency fund to 2-3x my monthly expendatures.

I think it makes sense for me to use that small backpay to completely pay off my credit card (and start paying off the balance every month like a responsible person). A few credit score calculators tell me that would bump my credit score into the +650 range, where I could most likely get a decent interest rate on a used car (3-5%). I would like to finance a reliable, AWD car because I am considered essential personnel and need to travel up to 75mi for Job #1 and Job#3. I'm looking at some kind of AWD Subaru because they are great in the winter and tend to have good fuel economy. In the Spring/Summer/Fall I tend to ride my motorcycle everywhere and get about 100MPG, so this would mainly be something I would only drive for groceries/winter/rain. Probably less than 10,000mi/year. I am leery of taking on any more debt until I take care of my student loan and CC debt, but having a reliable vehicle will mean I can work a lot more. I would be able to make more money both by doing extra military drills (funerals, etc), as well as being able to travel around the state to do more overtime details. Two overtime details per week could net me an extra $1000/mo. I also have an opportunity to take Job #4, which would net about $100/night + tipout.

I also want to pay off my student loan as aggressively as possible. 

What do you guys think of my plan, and would you do anything differently? Keep in mind my income can vary greatly from month to month, and sometimes I can even double my income from Job#1 depending on hours available. 

I also have a TSP retirement account, a Roth IRA that I have not funded for several years (I've lost about 30% due to the market since 2008), and a state government retirement fund, as well as working towards a state pension (3 more years until I am vested). Eventually I would like to transfer my Roth IRA from my current provider (LPL) to something like Fidelity.

worldpolitics,My thoughts.. Let me know if anybody reads them! :),"World trade is all about buying into the future
All big corporations of trade and finances, keep buying stuff and promising to pay later. If economy is growing, stock exchange people buy more stocks by borrowing money from banks. Hope is that tomorrow the stocks would be much 
higher value than current value +interest to be paid to the bank. Eg-

Today-
Buy stocks of $100
Borrow this money from bank(worst case scenario)

After 1 year -
Company is successful, it is valued by SoftBank at $150
Interest rate of bank -%10
Total owed to bank =$110
Now, 

Go to bank B, keep stock as collateral, get $110 dollars
Give $110 to bank,

After 2 year - 
Stock value = $200
Money owed to bank = $110 + $11 = $121
Sell stock 
Give money to bank B
Net, 
Earn $79

This last step can be shifted to future, if company earns a lot of money,so that it can pay just interest to Bank B ie just pay $11, or allow bank to lend you more/take this money later/sell more stock to bank/lending/funding foundation

ITS MAGIC!

In case of company failure, stocks don't increase, vuled at $50

Bank B doesn't give money, company dissolves, Bank loses money. Bank recovers by government bailout/selling higher interest to others/borrow from government (which prints the money). Government gives at lower rates, so that banks can recover. Also, when company dissolves, the owner/founder/ceo are already paid a lot to themselves so they are now rich even though the company failed.


The magic lies in the hands of the value creators ( founders, companies, people in general) and the financial gods turn it into money.

That is why, trickle down works in broader sense. Only when the financials value the company, the money comes. And then the company pays to it's employees so then society becomes rich. That's why value creators are needed for economy.

Also, money that is created never dies. It lives on forever unless destroyed.

So, forever, economies are growing and debt is also increasing. Challenge is to keep debt low so that lending cycle doesn't break. That can be allowed by having value creators in economy. 

War is a great fake value creator where people are buying and betting on the winners' future. 

Natural resources are primary value creators,

That is why manufacturing industry was revolutionary. Value creations was privatized and spread to so many companies, and then IT &amp; data &amp; ai &amp; technology provide value.


That also explains why growing out of poverty is such a challenge both at personal, emotional, economic (prom personal to global level) . No one gives/lends money to economy, so companies can't grow. So countries needed to create assets. Till 1991, India kept global control to itself so country had to self reliant, but no one wants your currency(and all your economy depends upon  value of your currency (or you have reserves of global reserves). Now, foreign money is value the. Companies in India so money is coming in.!!!",finance

personalfinance,"I found it makes more sense to pay on my medium loan rather than the largest one with the most interest, am I missing something?","I have three student loans in question:

Big loan: $19,435 principal, $6,743 interest, 7.21%  

Medium loan: $11,262 principal, $4297 interest, 6.41%  

small loan: $2,977 principal, $553 interest, 6.31%  

Interest is calculated only on the principal (not compounding) and is daily e.g. (interest)\*(principal)/365 

I am planning to make a large payment of around $12,000 now, and found that because I only reduce interest accruement by paying on principal, it actually saves me more money a year currently to pay all of that onto the medium loan ($494 per year saved in interest vs. $379 on the big loan) because of the interest barrier on the big one.

This is counterintuitive of course since the big one has the highest principal and highest interest rate, and of course if it was compounding then that one would be the winner no question.

Mixed combinations with the small loan don’t do any better either.

So I wanted to double check that I’m not missing any considerations before making the payment on the medium one. I’m planning to do around $500 per month on them every month from hereonafter, which I don’t think affects the answer much, but id like some input",finance

This would be an alternative to investing in stocks or just paying additional principal on the mortage for the next 2 years to reach 20% equity.

&amp;#x200B;

I was initially doing this as a thought experiment but after running some rough numbers in excel it appears my discount rate using an NPV calculation would be between 5-8% which seems like a much higher rate of return than expected. My assumptions are based on the below information. These numbers just seem to good to be true to me so please poke holes in any bad assumptions I may have.

&amp;#x200B;

**Assumptions** 

25K system cost installed

55% tax credit (NY 25% &amp; Fedral 30%)means \~11250$ initial negative cashflow

Home value would increase by at least 25K 

Lender doesn't allow PMI to dropoff until 2 years have passed , at 5% down PMI drops at 96 months normally therefore saving 72 months of PMI payments at 111$ per month. If it can be dropped before 24 months the rate of return just get's better

Energy savings of 1200$ annually (main reason for 4-8% range is I wasn't sure if this should increase by inflation over the panels estamated life of 30 years)

Thanks in advance for your time and advice.

I have two credit card debt's.

A = $7,500  
B= $4,500

Both require minimum payments of approx $180 per month to pay off. However I am in a position where I can be paying $500 per fortnightly to pay these off.

My question, what is the best approach to pay these off?

My thinking is to pay $800 on (B) per month and $200 on (A). Then once B is paid off, transfer $4,500 back on to (B) so I only have a 1% interest rate compared to 15%. Then start paying $800 per month on (A) untill balance is paid off.

“Clearly to put the cautions out there, risks have risen. Manufacturing has slowed down globally and clearly slowed down in the U.S. substantially. We are seeing some initial signs of that spilling over into the consumer. But to us, this reminds us of that period in 2015/2016 when we saw global manufacturing slowdown, it infected the U.S. and we even saw the consumer slow down a little bit then too. But that underlying resilience of the consumer ultimately kind of carried the day,” Pyle explained on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade.

Pyle added, “With the Fed being more accommodative, we are seeing the housing market pick back up, housing activity pick back up. And we think that will be enough to see us through as we get into 2020.”

I'm in my late 20s and I'm anticipating some pretty big life changes in the next few years - parents will be hitting retirement and will likely need some financial help, I'll be looking into buying a house, and, if all goes as planned, I'll also be a married man. With all of these life changes coming at me, I decided it was about time to really get serious with my finances.

I have a good amount saved up so far. However, I also have a fair amount of student loans left to pay off. I'm not comfortable with giving away the exact amounts of saved money and student loan debt. However, I have about 2.5x as much saved up as I have student loans. I have been following the standard 10 year plan to pay off my student loans and have always been paying just the minimum payment (which is already a pretty big monthly bill). There are multiple loans and all have different interest rates, varying from 3%-6% compounded interest. So far, I've been paying off my loans for just the minimum payment. My overly simplistic way of managing my finances was to take whatever money I have left after each paycheck and put it into my savings.

One thing I've been asking myself lately is: do I want to keep doing this? Should I just pay off all of my student loans right away? Or maybe at least the high interest student loans? I've been specifically concerned about how I'd look best when applying for a mortgage when I finally am ready to buy a home. Would the bank look at me more favorably with more money in my savings account, but also more debt? Or would I get a better mortgage with less debt, but also a smaller down payment on a home? I don't know much about buying a home, but one thing that I do know is that if I don't make at least a 20% down payment on a home, then I'll be paying less towards the principal amount on my mortgage since I'll also have to pay PMI.

Aside from the mortgage, I also have other concerns: helping out my parents when they hit retirement is one. Also, when I get married, we'd have both my student loans to worry about if they're not paid off but also my SO's student loans. I know that everyone handles their finances differently.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Wondering if getting an apartment at 25 is the right thing to do,"Hi all, I need your help! TL;DR at the end. 

I'm thinking of getting a loan for an apartment. Currently I'm making $1,300 a month after taxes (with a good annual raise) and about $10,000 a year from bonuses and other benefits. I own a car which I paid for upfront and no loans or fixed payments at all. My monthly expenses are about $350. I don't pay for rent since I'm staying in a dorm provided by the company I work for, but it can't be used by a couple. 
I only have $6,000in my savings account right now.

One thing to keep in mind is that I'm not from and not living in the US and salaries here are much lower than what most of people on PF are used to. Minimum wage is about $350 a month. 

My main problem is that although I'm making good money relatively and saving most of the money I'm making, my family keeps relying on me for any inconvenience they have and I can't just ignore them and I always end up helping them with whatever they need. I've paid for my brother's tuition, helped my dad with his debt and failures, helped my mother to get an apartment after her divorce and other issues like these just won't stop.

My idea is that I really need to have fixed payments to just stop spending money on stuff that isn't mine. I tried to just save and stop spending on shit but it's not working.

My bank offered me financing for a $100k apartment with an interest of 7.25% (declining rate?) which is the best I found after checking other banks in my country. They also won't charge me fees. On the phone they told me payment will be about $900 monthly for 15 years.

So now I'm thinking of getting an apartment and slowly working on furnishing and preparing it for when I decide to move to it after at least a year since I'm not in a hurry.

So question is, is it a good deal? Should I go for it? Will I be losing a lot of money on interest even if I make yearly payments of about $7,000 or more on top of monthly payments?

And another thing, our Central Bank follows US Federal Bank regarding lowering or raising interest rate on loans, so is it a good idea to wait since it was lowered by 0.50% in the last 2 months?  I'm not an expert on this. 

I'm really excited about getting this apartment and finishing payments at 40 years old, then I could move to a bigger house which I really would like to have. I can find a nice apartment with $100k right now since housing prices are down currently. I also feel like it would be nice to get done with getting a place so I can work and focus on something else. And I think I will be getting a loan within 5 years to get an apartment anyway. 

TL;DR: 25 years outside of US making good money relatively and would like to get an apartment. I was offered a $100k loan with monthly payments of $900 for 15 years (no fees and 7.25% declining interest rate?), is it a good deal? I will be making other large payments when I have the chance to pay less interest.

*50% of the first 6% after four years  

I recently opened a Traditional IRA at Vanguard and rolled over ~10k from my previous employer's 401k.

I tell them what the driver did and they tell me that the driver told them that this was an Express package, not ground.  They ask me to tell them what's on the label.

I tell them whats on the label, tracking number etc, and its got a big fucking G on it, for Ground.  ""Well, that's a ground package, not sure why the driver is saying it was Express.""  Skipping the 2 hours I spent on the phone figuring out this cluster, it was because that lazy driver decided he didn't want to take such a heavy package, and decided to lie and say that it was mislabeled.

Finally they figure out that the driver lied about it being an Express package and tell me that ""Its too heavy for ground and needs to go freight"" but freight is super expensive so you need to call Walmart to authorize it.  At this point I'm about to tear my hair out, I've been dealing with this all day and I say fuck it, I'll just deal with this on Monday.

Before the day ends that Friday (9/20/19), I get a knock on my door around 6:30PM.  FedEx (Express) man says hes here to pick up my package.  ??  I explain to him what all has happened today and the problems with getting it returned etc and he says that he'll take it for me.  Sweet.

In the back of my mind I thought this could be a problem as this had a G label and he was an E driver... but I was so over it at this point and ready to be done with it.  I asked if my tracking number would still work and he said yes.  (This tracking number shows that the package was delivered 09/24/19)

While this AC Unit was in route to be returned.  My chair arrives.  SURPRISE.  Another AC unit.  Exact same one.  Fool me once... something something FML.  I am not about to deal with this nightmare that was this FedEx return again, so I call my local Walmart and ask them if I can return this to them.  On the phone with them for another 2 hours because ""this item isn't what's on your order"" -- they eventually tell me yes and I back my truck up to the hill next to my house, and wheel this heavy mofo up into the back of it.  I get to the Walmart, no one knows what I'm talking about or how to do it.  After being there for an hour, eventually they get to the manager that I had talked to on the phone and get my return processed and refunded.

Okay 1 AC unit down.  1 to go.  I keep an eye on my tracking number and see that I still haven't been refunded as of 10/2.  I e-mail in.  I get a response back the same day.  I will spare you the full e-mail, but the important part is here:

&gt;The one returned via FedEx,  was delivered to our return center on September 24th.  It may take up to 7 business days for it to be scanned in, this timeframe expires tomorrow, therefore tomorrow you should receive a notification that your refund process has been started.

2 days pass and still no refund.  I e-mail again.  No response.  I give it another 24 hours, e-mail again, no response.  Inform them that if I'm not refunding I'm just going to dispute the charge with PayPal.  No response.  I open the dispute with PayPal.  PayPal tells me that this will take 10 days.  On day 8 (today), I get an e-mail asking for more information.  They want my tracking number.  I give it to them.  PayPal responds within minutes that they need ""A copy of the actual return label that was used on the package.""  I don't have that.  I have the link from FedEx, but you only have 5 days to access the link after you open it.  I send them all of this information, screen shots of the pages etc.  PayPal immediately responds, ***We have received a response from the merchant and we've also reviewed all the details of your case. Based on the merchant’s response and the information we have to date, we have to deny your case. This decision was made because we did not receive valid proof or tracking that you returned the merchandise.***  ???

It then tells me I can appeal, so I opened an appeal and am waiting on a response.

That is where I am right now.  Losing my fucking mind.  What do I do?  Can I dispute this $217.81 (price of chair with taxes) charge with Chase, the CC that's tied to my PayPal account?

My next step I guess is to call FedEx and see if they can send me a copy of the label that I was given via the link I have.  It says I still have 2 days to access it.

Edit: Since posting, I have talked to FedEx and they will not provide me with a copy of the label that I used because I am not the account holder, Walmart is.  And PayPal denied my Appeal -- ""This decision was made because we did not receive valid proof or tracking that you returned the merchandise.""  Even though I provided them with my tracking number.  I always thought your tracking number was all you needed to provide proof?",finance
personalfinance,Trading mortgage for credit union ?,"Stay with me here, but I’m wondering if it would make more sense/is even possible to take our mortgage on our house $60,521.61 and see if we can get a loan through a credit union to pay it off. Reason being is it’s a factory built “mobile home” and we financed it though the company’s mortgage company because you can not get a traditional mortgage. The problem is the interest is 8.3% and I’m tired of paying so much.  We love our home and for it to be a “mobile home” it’s very nice. I would just like to see a lower interest rate so we can actually start paying more on the principal balance.",finance

personalfinance,Debating paying off debt or contributing to retirement fund.,"As the title says I'm a 24yo currently looking at whether to pay off roughly $37,000 of private student loans at an average interest rate of 5.6% (half is 5.4 half is 5.8) or if just saving and investing is a better option. I'll also note that I have looked around and read up on average rate of returns and I know that this sub generally says anything below 6% is fine. That said I'm still leaning towards paying off the debt just because it's one less payment, it reduces my credit utilization for a future mortgage if i decide to get into real estate, and the fact that the stock market seems iffy at best right now (ik, ik cant time the market). I also know though that interest payments on student loans are a tax write off which also reduces the effective interest rate and that realistically based on past performance (which doesnt necessarily indicate future results mind you) the market will average 7% over my lifetime. So I guess what I'm asking is what is your all of your opinions on this matter. I could go either way right now and I just want someone else to weigh in with their opinion.

personalfinance,Best Way to Continue to Raise Credit Score,"Hi All,

I currently have a 784-9 credit score depending on the bureau but would like to continue to raise that score since I envision a house purchase in the near to 5-year future and just for a sense of accomplishment as well. I have been working hard to get this score to where it is today but I know it can go higher, but don't know the best way to raise without dinging the score or honestly doing something stupid.

I have excellent marks on all factors except 2 areas:

Total Accounts - 9 and Age of Credit History - 4 years 1 month

At this point, I personally do not need additional credit cards but at my standpoint it feels like the only option. I have a higher interest rate on the car loan which I am thinking about refinancing in order to get better rate and lessen time on the loan itself. 

Any thoughts and ideas are appreciated. Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Advice for a student,"Here's my situation, I am Thousands of dollars in credit card debt, i take personal responsibility and recognize that it is the result of my own stupid decision.

I am a full time college student, I have a job as well but the problem is that my boss (despite my explanations) has zero consideration of the fact that I'm a full time students, and schedules me to work just about every minute I'm not in class. Even on days when I don't have class, I'm scheduled a double shift so I'm basically there all day. I have no time to do homework because of this and I am failing a class because of missed deadlines when I had to be at work. Despite this, I am still having trouble keeping up with credit card payments, and it seems that every time I make a payment, interest hits and I end up not cutting down as much debt as I'd hoped.

I am planning on transferring to UNC Charlotte next year. But while i'm still here, I want to quit my job and focus on school because I dread going in to work every day, but I am terrified of doing it because of my debt, but I barely make enough to meet the minimum payment anyway, and that's before interest charges. I've considered declaring bankruptcy but I am terrified that it may affect my federal aid for school.

Due to undisclosed reasons, in, April, I will be receiving enough money to pay off my debt but that is several months away, and if I quit my job, I may go a few months with no income. I understand that quitting will have a negative effect, but I hate my job so much, and I am so tired of people making me feel like garbage on a daily basis because our restaurant has sierra mist and not sprite (just an example). I'm not asking for advice on whether to quit or not if push comes to shove, I'll go back to my old much more enjoyable job, what I really want to know, is, if I go these few months without an income, and pay off my debt in April when I receive the money, will it be the end of the world for me?

personalfinance,26yo Student Loans on IBR for PSLF- Do I need to resubmit to increase my payments?,"26yo federal student loans, entering second year of payments (post undergrad and grad school) on Income Based Repayments. All of my loans are federal and I work at a 501(c)3 so I am in the process for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Started making payments December 2018, so my annual recertifications are due in November. 

Financial Context: graduated grad school May 2018, start job June 2018, applied for PSLF and IBR October 2018. Due to forebearance, start making payments December 2018. Income 50k gross, 10k non student loan debt from a lot of dental work (I do have dental insurance, but yes, I needed that much work, and yes I'm sure I checked with multiple dentists) and poor choices that may have in part been due a combination of mental health and possibly neurological disorders.

Personal context: I am going through some health issues and am currently in the process of working on finding a diagnosis for a neurological condition that has been affecting my cognitive ability intermittently and I am worried that I have made a mistake or accidently misrepresented myself in the IDR recertification.

I submitted the paperwork to recertify IBR and the results came back that my payments will drop from around $250 to less than $30. 

In the IBR initial application I submitted copies of my paystubs and the payment dad determined to be less than $250 which was an easy amount for me to be able to pay while having enough to work on reducing my personal debt. 

During my recertification it told me that I had to link to the IRS, so I did. After that the only question was ""has your income significantly reduced?"" The answer to that is no, it hasn't reduced, in fact it has increased because my 2018 taxes only reflect half a year's work. There was no other place I could see to report what my current monthly income was.

Approx 2 days later I get a notice saying that my payments will reduce to less than $30/mo. This won't take affect until next month so I think I have a week or so to resubmit without messing things up.

The only option to report change in income also specifically stated ""If your income or family size has changed you can request that your income-driven payment be re-calculated to reduce your current monthly payment.""

But I don't need it reduced, I'm actually fine with it going up. Do I need to resubmit an income change? Should I? Have I missed something?

A note regarding PSLF: if you are going towards PSLF you are incentivised not to pay more than your minimum because the idea is that it's the number of payments not the amount of money that needs to be payed in order for you to be eligible so I'm not planning on any more than the minimum. I know there's a lot of controversy about PSLF but this is what I'm gambling on. I did receive confirmation that my first 10 payments have qualified and do count towards the total 120 payments. If PSLF works out it will save me roughly 50k.",finance

I quickly became responsible and took on all my debt and over this decade have an extremely stable financial situation. I'm still paying on the school debts, but I have the flexibility to live my life. 

My company offers Tuition Reimbursement and I decided to go back to school and finish since it would be fully paid for. Apparently however, I still owe this school money for a semester and now I am unable to continue in my education without an official transcript.

They never sent this account to collections for some reason either, so it never showed up on my credit report which I watched like a hawk. I spoke to them about it awhile ago and they won't accept any payment plan for satisfaction only the full amount. The debt is around 5k.

At this point, I am confused on how to move forward financially. Its a typical one semester price, but more than most people including me have in their savings.

For refinance, I have it with SoFi. Not sure if it would be worth talking to them about different terms. My credit score is pretty good, and I have two debts that I am about to pay to zero that I can hold off for until I refinance if closing accounts will affect anything.",finance

I have been getting consistent paychecks whether I work 3 hrs or 50. I’d say 60–80 percent of the time I have worked weeks over 40 hrs.

Due to my state law with nannying, the position is non exempt meaning I should be paid time and a half for any hours over 40 in a 7 day period. That is the key.

financialindependence,Negative Interest Rates and FIRE,"I'm curious how negative rates do not seem to be a big concern for the fire community. Japan and big portion of Europe both now have negative interest rates. This hasn't happened in the US yet but it's a viable possibility. 

Negative interest rates would blow up most FIRE plans, the same way they are blowing up European and Japanese pension funds that are seeing their assets getting smaller instead of larger over time while obligations are coming up. 

I read Howard Mark's paper on negative rates [https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/mysterious.pdf](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/mysterious.pdf) and it's daunting. Here is one of the impacts of negative rates that stood out.

""Negative rates can warp the calculation of discounted present values. In particular, when the discount rate is negative, the present value of future pension obligations can exceed their future value. The combination of high discounted obligations and low yields on investments can be disastrous for the funded status of pension funds.""

If a negative interest rate environment does happen then FIRE would become much more difficult: The 4%/per year expectation in such an environment would become uncertain and the real returns for defensive portfolios could end up being 0% or negative for many years possibly decades. 

On the other hand, one would hope that things would become cheaper over time in a deflationary environment but losing the compounding interest might not make up for the lower cost of living.",finance

I’m very good with money, have no current debts, and if I wanted to I could buy a 20K car outright (assuming I carried 20K in cash on me). I only plan on taking out a loan in order to help better my credit since I know I could pay it off in full. Now, I was planning on just suffering the pain of regret and just accepting the 12, or 14% APR on the loan that was offered to me, that is until another service member mentioned the SCRA. It’s an act that limits service members interest rate to I believe 6ish %. But all the descriptions I’ve read says that only applies to debts accrued before military service. 

However, I’m being told that two of her soldiers beneath her used the act to cap the newly bought cars interest rate at 6.5% just this past weekend. These were not old debts, and were bought without a well-standing prior existing credit. 

My line of credit is fairly new, and sits at about 698. My auto credit history is non existent since ive never taken out a loan before to buy a car.

personalfinance,Should I consolidate CC debt?,"Hello personal finance gurus, 

Ive made some very poor financial choices in my youth and we can skip judgment in the comments please, I need practical advice on how to move forward. I am wondering if debt consolidation is right for me. I am now older and have budgeting under control, I make around 100,000 a year, and have began to aggressively pay down my CC debt. My issue is I’m being CRUSHED by my interest rates. I’ve done a fair amount of research, and understand that as long as the loan is less interest and I don’t spend all of my new free credit (my habits have changed now so I’m not worried), that in theory debt consolidation is a good idea. There’s a lot of pros and cons out there on the internet, so I’ve come to a different corner of the internet to see what you lovely people think of my situation. 

CC # 1 - owe: $9827 IR: 24.74%. Monthly payment $500

CC #2 - owe: $3952 IR: 24.74% monthly payment: $300 

CC #3 - owe: $8463 IR: 19.9% monthly payment: minimum payment due - usually around $350
 
Cc score is around 675. 

Monthly take home is about 4500 after what I pay in taxes, and put in my 401k. Fixed spending of rent and things around 2k, spending around 1200 paying down my CC debt (also a $273 student loan payment every month), leaving me about 1 K for groceries, gas, and extras. I really don’t think I can afford more to the CC payment honestly. 

As you can see, I’m paying over $1000 a month to these Debts, but with the interest rate almost half of every payment is a wash. I think if I consolidate to a lower interest rate I could really make a dent in these debts and start to build a real saving account aside from what I’m putting in my 401k. I’ve had these debts for years now and have made some headway but it’s a lengthy process. With my low credit I’m worried I couldn’t even get a lower interest rate on a personal loan though. So reddit, what are my options? Consolidate debt or continue to pay it down as I have been?

personalfinance,Inheritance guilt / uncertainty,"My dad died unexpectedly four months ago, not long before his planned retirement. My mom died when I was young; all of his assets are passing to me.


$250,000 life insurance (no tax implications)

$350,000 retirement accounts (RMDs starting next year; taxable as income)

est. $300,000 cash from estate (after house is sold and all debts paid)



My only debt is a $205k mortgage (4.15% interest rate) on a condo worth 260k. I make $60k/yr. I'm 31 years old; I had $60k saved for retirement previously, and a roughly $30k emergency fund.


I'm still struggling to process all of this, mostly because it's way more money than I've ever dealt with or expected to receive. I feel guilty about being handed a big chunk of money that my dad worked hard to save for himself. I feel that I don't deserve it in any real sense. I'm also worried about mismanaging it.


My first instinct is to use the life insurance payout to eliminate my mortgage entirely. This seems like a simple step, and lets me use (or invest) more of the money that I've actually earned. That appeals to me on an emotional level.


On the other hand, the advisor who I spoke to while accepting the retirement accounts tried to convince me to put all of the cash into an actively-managed taxable account (with 1% fees), maintain my current lifestyle / budget, and let the money grow into some ridiculous number over many years. Details aside, I guess the overall strategy there is more strictly rational, since the market will likely outperform 4.15% over time.


I understand that actively-managed accounts have a very bad reputation here. Still, given the amount of cash I'm looking at, I feel like I will need some sort of a taxable investment account no matter what, and I'm not sure I feel comfortable handling that 100% myself.



I have two main questions, I guess:

-Would I be crazy to pay off this mortgage immediately instead of investing the 205k?

-How do I find a neutral financial advisor? I'm willing to accept professional help, but I felt like the ""fiduciary"" from the retirement company was mainly interested in selling me on his company's product.",finance

Is it worth it to graduate and get a job or get a BS in Finance and accumulate two years worth of debt? My mom is requiring that I take out the federal maximum every year, and she hates discussing college finances with me. I don’t think it really matters where I go to school, but she’s pressuring me to apply to Cornell ILR. Should I focus more on cost or program reputation?",finance
personalfinance,"When keeping “6 months expenses” in savings, should I include my retirement account?","I am 35f, single, no kids and great credit (788 last I checked). I have to keep $2500 in my checking account to avoid fees. I also have an emergency savings/new car fund (not quite $17k) and started an investment account with my mother’s inheritance (currently $6,370 in a managed moderate risk portfolio).

My monthly expenses are presently pretty minimal. $348 health insurance and $859 rent on the 1st of the month and a roughly $650 credit card bill on the 17th (which includes the utilities not included in rent). I get my employer sponsored health benefits back on November 1st, after which I will be bringing in about $500 aper week between my 2 jobs (conservative estimate-I get a lot of OT), but that $348 bill is gone.

So rounding up to my usual expenses of about $2k monthly and knowing I wanted to buy a new car (estimating payments at $300-400), I set a goal to keep $14.2k in my savings and use the rest towards my down payment. But, only putting $3000 down, the payments will be over $400. Meanwhile my interest rate got slashed again and my current vehicle needs more than $3000 worth of work. 

But, between the 3 accounts, I’ll still have over $22k in the bank, my jobs are pretty stable and I plan to work as hard as I can for as long as I can. So what can I count towards my emergency savings when subtracting my down payment?

Tl;dr: have $22k in bank after accounting for $3k down payment on new car but only $14.2k in designated savings, which is 6 months living expenses. Want to put more down but don’t know if I should.

EDIT: This is not a matter of whether or not I’m taking out the loan. My current vehicle is 12 years old, and needs nearly twice it’s value in repairs (over $4000, more than I’ve actually saved towards a down payment) as it’s getting to an age where it’s more and more unreliable. So if I’m going to dig into my savings, it’s to replace it. Vehicle repairs also will mean time off of work and I’m more comfortable with a predictable monthly payment without risking my job. I’m just trying to decide whether to take more out of the emergency fund to lower my monthly payments to a more manageable payment.",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 21st, 2019.

# **Stocks will likely hit new records in the week ahead if earnings keep topping expectations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/19/stocks-go-for-all-time-highs-next-week-as-the-earnings-season-continues.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks will try in the week ahead to break the all-time highs set earlier in the year as a slew of S&amp;P 500 companies get set to report.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are both around 1% below their all-time highs while the Nasdaq Composite is about 2% away from its record. The indexes got a lift this after a big chunk of this week’s reporters posted better-than-expected results. They were also boosted by improving sentiment around Brexit and U.S.-China trade negotiations.
*****
&gt; The all-time highs could be tested as about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies, or around 24%, are scheduled to release their quarterly results in the week ahead. Some of those companies include Caterpillar and Boeing, both of which are expected to report Wednesday before the bell. Amazon, Intel, McDonald’s and Chipotle Mexican Grill are also on deck for the week.
*****
&gt; “You’ve got the potential for a combination of things that drive us to new highs,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “At the same time you’re getting better micro data in the earnings, you’re getting better news on the macro hurdles facing us.”
*****
&gt; More than 14% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported through Friday, FactSet data shows. Of those companies, 81% posted earnings that beat analyst expectations.
*****
&gt; J.P. Morgan Chase’s report on Tuesday sent the stock to an all-time high while Citigroup and Bank of America also got a boost from their earnings releases. Netflix, meanwhile, briefly rallied around 7% Thursday before ending the session up 2.5%. Morgan Stanley advanced 1.5% on earnings. Coca-Cola climbed more than 1% on Friday after releasing its quarterly numbers.
*****
&gt; To be sure, the companies are being rated on a very low bar this earnings season. Analysts polled by FactSet expected third-quarter earnings to have fallen by 4.6%.
*****
&gt; “Earnings can be a positive catalyst to the extent that expectations are pretty low,” said Dan Russo, chief market strategist at Chaikin Analytics. “The bar has been lowered to the point where companies can jump over it.”
*****
&gt; But investors might have a harder time digesting the week’s reports.
*****
&gt; Companies such as Caterpillar are heavily affected by the U.S.-China trade war given their exposure to overseas markets. Boeing and Intel also have overseas exposure. Meanwhile, reports from companies such as Amazon, McDonald’s and Chipotle will be heavily scrutinized as investors look for clues on how the consumer is doing.
*****
&gt; “Trade frictions and the global economic slowdown have clearly affected 2019 earnings growth thus far,” Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in a note. “The third-quarter earnings reporting season will likely confirm that those negatives continued to pour over into last quarter’s results.”
*****
&gt; The good news for investors is recent trade talks appear to have yielded some progress. President Donald Trump announced Oct. 11 the U.S. and China had reached a “very substantial phase one” deal. Multiple reports this week said China wants additional talks before signing off on the first phase, but National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Thursday there is “a lot of momentum” to finalize the deal.
*****
&gt; John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, said the “narrative” around trade had gotten “so one-sided to the negative side, there may be a better chance than not that a phase-one deal is signed.”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, preliminary figures on consumer sentiment showed a slight increase in October from September. The final consumer sentiment numbers for the month are scheduled for release on Friday.
*****
&gt; “If corporate earnings show signs of resilience, especially by the U.S. consumer, then a run to new highs is by no means out of the question,” Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, said in a note.

# The Calendar Could Have Bulls Smiling

&gt; “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” — Mark Twain

&gt; Stocks have continued their surprising strength in October, thanks to a potential thaw in the U.S.-China trade dispute. And remember, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been lower in October during a pre-election year only once since 1987. Additionally, over the past 20 years, October has been the third-best month on average for the S&amp;P 500. October has had a bad rap due to some spectacular crashes, but the truth is the month usually is pretty good for stocks.

&gt; “The calendar could be about to turn into a bull’s best friend, as late October has been when stocks historically started their end-of-year rally,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “No two years are ever the same, and we all remember last year’s sell-off. However, a better than expected earnings season, coupled with positive steps on trade and one more Federal Reserve rate cut this year could allow bulls to smile the rest of 2019.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, we are very near the historically strong end of year for equities. Whether you look at the average year or a pre-election year, stocks have tended to deliver an upward bias starting soon.

# Buy in October, and Get Yourself Sober

&gt; Folks have become fixated with “Sell In May” but forget to “Buy in October, and Get Yourself Sober.” Our Best Six Months MACD Buy Signal that triggered last Friday, October 11th, initially appears to be timely. Friday’s Alert detailed several trades that were deployed Monday and updated in a follow up Alert on Monday. In addition to the Seasonal Sector ETF trades and the Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy Portfolio trades in DIA, SPY, QQQ and IWM we released a New October Stock Basket yesterday!

&gt; As you can see in the chart below of the S&amp;P 500 the MACD “Buy” indicator trigger in the lower pane, highlighted in the yellow box with the black arrow, came in strong below the zero line. In the upper pane resistance at 3010 still persists. Aside from this resistance technically things look encouraging. We held support last August above 2815 and have been making higher lows since then, riding the 200-day moving average higher. The 50-day moving average has also constructively turned higher.

&gt; As we have been monitoring all year, seasonal patterns for the Pre-Election remain on track, though the October dip came early. Save some truly negative news, the low for the year is likely in. With the market tracking this seasonal pattern so closely all year that suggests the pattern is likely to continue, which means some backing and filing around S&amp;P 3000 through late November before additional new highs toward yearend.

# Bonds Bounce Back In Fund Flows Data

&gt; The week ended October 9th saw relatively large inflows into bond funds and relatively large outflows from equity funds. Across all mutual and exchange traded funds, equity flows were in the 7th percentile of all readings since 2013, with outflows of $11.5bn. Of that total, $5.8bn was ETFs, with the lion’s share of equity fund outflows coming from domestic funds. As has so frequently been the case lately, bond funds were the exact opposite situation. Total bond fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs meant $5.8bn of new cash on the week, which is in the 64th percentile of all periods. ETFs were relatively stronger, with bond funds drawing $1.9bn of inflows, higher than more than 81% of periods since 2013. Within both ETF and combined mutual and ETF flows, municipal bonds were the standouts, with total flows in the top 10% of all periods. Since 2013, $152bn has flowed into mutual funds and ETFs that own municipal government bonds, with more than $90bn of that coming since the end of 2017. Those flows are very likely being driven by tax-advantaged buying incentivized by the changes to the tax code at the end of 2017 which ended a variety of popular state and local tax deductions.

# ISM Offsides, If Not Utterly Incorrect

&gt; This week’s manufacturing activity releases from the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed a slightly weaker but generally upbeat assessment of economic activity. The numbers from these two regional surveys may not be fully representative of the aggregate national economy, but they’re usually a pretty good indicator. As shown in the chart below, they’ve been a decent guide to what the ISM Manufacturing index says about national activity since the Empire State manufacturing index started its releases in 2001.

&gt; Unlike these two indices, which have shown a general uptick in activity over the last few months, the ISM index shows a different route. But that data isn’t backed up by the average results across the five Fed districts that survey their manufacturers. The size and scale of the divergence is so big that one of these indices is almost certainly wrong, but which?

&gt; For a tiebreaker, Markit’s manufacturing survey suggests conditions are at multi-month highs and picking up, more consistent with the data from Fed surveys than ISM. Markit’s sample size is bigger and the index is more representative of the whole sector than ISM only; with all five regional Fed surveys in the mix, they also have a sample size advantage over ISM. Hard data of late (including manufacturing production, exports, and hiring) has all sided against ISM and is showing data more consistent with the Five Fed or Markit surveys. For now, it looks like the brutal ISM results are a bit overstated.

# Nasadaq - One Downtrend Down, Another To Go

&gt; In a post yesterday, we discussed the seemingly never-ending rangebound trading pattern for the STOXX 600. It's not just Europe either. Seemingly everywhere you look these days, there's a major equity index stuck in some sort of range. The Nasdaq is just one example of many. At a level of around 8,140, the Nasdaq is at the same level it was at exactly six months ago and also all the way back in August of last year.

&gt; Last week at this time, things were looking good for the Nasdaq as the index had bounced off of support at its 200-DMA and broke its short-term downtrend from the September lower high. This week has seen further gains with the Nasdaq rising more than 1%, but that rally looks to have stalled out yesterday right at another downtrend from the July high. A meaningful break of that downtrend would come into play at around 8,200 which is just over half of one percent above current levels. Using our Trend Analyzer tool, of the 100 stocks in the Nasdaq 100, heading into today, 43 were overbought and just five were oversold, so it may take a few days of 'rest' for the index before a meaningful break of that downtrend can occur.

# Rangebound on Both Sides of the Atlantic

&gt; Everyone here is well aware of the fact that equities have been stuck in what seems like an endless trading range where the S&amp;P 500 has failed to break out meaningfully to new highs. What some investors may not be of cognizant of is the fact that over in Europe, the benchmark STOXX 600 has also been stuck in a trading range of its own. While the index peaked at higher levels in 2015, it subsequently fell over 25% during the global sell-off in late 2015/early 2016. From those lows, the STOXX rallied more than 30% for the next 15 months. Since May 2017, though, the index has been stuck in a range and unable to meaningfully break out to new highs.

&gt; This year's performance for the STOXX 600 has been a continuation of the holding pattern that the index has been stuck in since 2017. Earlier today, it looked as though we were getting close to a breakout as the index hit a 52-week high, but late in the European session equities sold-off nearly 1% from the intraday highs finishing near the lows of the day. Oh well. Maybe tomorrow.

&gt; What bulls in Europe are hoping is that today's late-day sell-off isn't a repeat of what happened on July 25th. Back then, we saw a similar-looking breakout, but like today, the gains didn't hold and the STOXX 600 reversed over 1% and finished near the lows of the day. From the high on the day of that failed breakout in late July to the August lows, the STOXX 600 went on to fall nearly 9%.

# S&amp;P 500 Sector Valuations

&gt; The S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month P/E ratio has ticked up to 19.62 recently, which is close to its highest level of the past year. For valuations to stop expanding on any breakout higher for the S&amp;P, we'll need to see earnings (the ""E"" in P/E) keep up with price. That's going to be a tough ask for corporate America this quarter, so we may be heading into 2020 with valuations at more concerning levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/spxpe.png))**

&gt; Below are one-year charts of P/E ratios for ten S&amp;P 500 sectors. These charts are included in our weekly Sector Snapshot report sent to Bespoke Premium members. Consumer Discretionary has the highest P/E ratio at 24.15 followed by Technology at 23.38. Tech's P/E has really jumped a lot recently to new 52-week highs. The Financial sector has the lowest P/E of the major sectors at just 13.27.

# Open Season For Small Caps

&gt; There’s been chatter for many moons about the under performance of small cap stocks recently. True they have been under performing since the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks hit its all-time high close over a year ago on August 31, 2018. However, the trend of under performance tracks the historical small cap seasonality quite well.

&gt; With the Russell 2000 up a fraction today as the major U.S. large indices were down a bit from our historical seasonal pattern perspective this looks like the beginning of the bottom of small cap under performance and the beginning of the new “Small Effect.”

&gt; As you can see in the accompanying chart the R2K has been tracking the pattern quite well since July and looks like the small fry are coming out of hibernation just in time for small cap stock hunting season.

&gt; See page 110 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019 and page 112 of the soon-to-be released 2020 edition for deep background.

# October Back on Track – Earnings Season Ramps Up

&gt; After a bumpy start, the market is back on track at the mid-point of October. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are slightly above average at this point in the month compared to the last 21-year historical average. NASDAQ is comfortably above average and continues to lead. Negative headlines have given way to more upbeat news. Trade headlines are now featuring some progress even though tariffs remain in place and third quarter earnings season is underway with a solid report from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) today. Provided economic data and corporate earnings hold up, the market is likely to continue its run toward all-time highs and October could end with above average gains.

personalfinance,Getting a home loan with student loan question,"Hello, I have spent the past 2 1/2 years aggressively paying down my student loans while my husband has been saving for a down payment for a home. I am in the homestretch and could pay off my remaining $2,400 balance by December of this year. My question is this- would it look better for purchasing a home to maybe pay it down to 1,500 and pay the monthly payments of $68 until we secure a mortgage, or just pay it off ASAP and then get the mortgage approval letter? I have heard conflicting advice on this. I have a small car loan that I had initially intended to pay off after my student loan (interest rate is lower) but I could divert the additional money to pay that off first instead. 

Thank you for your help!",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan and Finance Questions,"For a little backstory, I am a third-year student at a public university in California studying business and tech writing. I'm planning on graduating in the Fall of 2021 and have been able to get through school so far with minimal debt (Less than 2K in CC) thanks to VA/state financial aid, working, and my parents. I am also currently studying abroad and will be returning to the US in December. 

However, my parents are filing for bankruptcy and have informed me that they won’t be able to help past May. Due to the way my financial aid is structured, I have a tuition waiver tied to not making more than the federal poverty level (12K) and I have a living stipend dependent on how many hours I’m in class per month (typically $900-1K, however can range to lower than $300). It typically isn’t enough to cover living expenses as I live in an extremely expensive area.  
I don’t know too much about student loans and haven’t applied for FAFSA since I first applied for college three years ago. My parents make too much in order to get much help and due to their bankruptcy, I’m unable to get them to cosign. They have also been exceedingly difficult in giving me their financial information for FAFSA. Can I apply without co-signers? Are there places that will accept my fair (680), but very limited/short credit? What do you recommend I do? Thanks and apologies in advance, I’m not very knowledgable about personal finance so I’m still learning.",finance
personalfinance,Seeking Car Buying advice,"Hello reddit. I am a 24yo male needing a new car and very conflicted on what I should get. I was rear-ended and have a couple weeks to search for a new car to replace my 2004 Nissan Titan. My goal is to be as financially responsible as I can while still getting something I want to a certain degree. 

My finances: 
I make about 80K/ year gross with fairly low expenses. I typically put about $2500 in my savings account every month.
I have 60k In savings, 4k in retirement, and 15k in mature bonds, 5k in student loan dept at about 4% interest (I may plan to pay this off pretty soon).

My goals:
I have some fairly ambitious goals financially and otherwise. I am early in my career as a software engineer and expect my salary to increase much in coming years. I plan to invest in real estate and be a landlord on the side as soon as the opportunity arises and I will need a large capital investment for this, but don't plan on this happening for a few years. I also plan to sail the world for a year (live-aboard a sailboat and travel) as it's my greatest life ambition and I already have the financials to make that possible.

The car:
So I need a new car and want to make the best decision financially that I can. I've considered buying a new 2019 or 2020 toyota tacoma TRD Off-road because I like trucks, may potentially need something capable where I live (Denver CO) and because of my hobbies, and have driven trucks most my whole life. I've looked at the tacoma based upon it's reputation for reliability and very low depreciation rate. https://usedfirst.com/cars/toyota/tacoma/ Still though I've always been told never buy new (dealers have offered me 33,300 on new 2019 with a tech package (msrp 38,000) or 34,000 on a new 2020 with no tech package(msrp 37,000)). I have considered other used vehicles too, like a 5 year old F-150 or other trucks too but not as much thus far. I could also consider buying a car or SUV too, but haven't looked at that as much. If I buy new my insurance will go up buy 70 or so a month with full coverage, and I previously had no coverage on my old vehicle. Liability will stay the same. I've considered also that if the interest rate to finance is over 4% I will probably pay cash and if under 4% I will probably finance. 

So reddit, help me make the best decision please. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Major life changes have trapped me in an expensive situation,"Hi, everyone. I’m 31 years old, got divorced about a year ago, and have been working full time for eight years — but I’ve been laid off five times since I finished college. I have a basic understanding of personal finance and am aware that I spend way too much money on student loan payments and my car, but I’m not sure how to fix that. Let me explain. 

Income: Well, I *was* making $4,833 a month until I got laid off in September. Right now I’m collecting severance in that amount and I have at least one job offer for $5,000 a month. So let’s assume I’ll continue operating with similar income. I live in an expensive east coast city (relocated here six months ago for the job that laid me off).

Rent: I pay $840/month for a room in a shared house in a relatively inexpensive part of the city. I signed a 12-month lease in September. 

The car thing: I lease an SUV for $365/month. Insurance is $165/month. This made sense 18 months ago when I was living in a smallish city where a car was absolutely necessary to get around. At the time, I was married to someone making about as much money as I was and we chose an SUV because my ex-husband is a huge dude who literally could not fit comfortably into a smaller car — plus we had a dog and took a lot of road trips. 

Now, I’m divorced and living in a big city where I absolutely do not need a car, and certainly not an SUV. However, I have also been in a couple of minor accidents since moving, which means I can’t trade the car in or have someone take over my lease until I get that damage fixed. The work is estimated to cost $1000 or so — I simply don’t have it, even though I’m aware that I spend half that on the car each and every month. (Fortunately, I guess, I use very little gas and do not have to pay for parking.)

About the loans: I owe about $84k from a combination of federal and private loans. My monthly payments add up to $993/month. A lot of this debt comes from the $44k I owe to a predatory private lender, at 7% interest. That payment alone is $482 per month. 

Oh, and credit card debt: I have about $11785 in credit card debt. Much of that stems from supporting myself and my ex during times of unemployment or underemployment. I try to pay more than the minimum payment but often end up using the cards for groceries or medical bills between paychecks. So that number has obviously been slow to shrink. 

So, how do I get myself out of this situation? The most obvious things (get rid of the car, move to a cheaper city or get a cheaper apartment) are not options right now. I’m hoping there’s something else I’m missing because I’m in a dire situation here even though I’m making decent money. Thanks in advance for any help.

EDIT TO ADD MORE INFO:
I’ve worked on reducing some variable expenses, and I think the situation will look better six months from now: 
- obviously bringing restaurant and bar spending close to about 0 
- spending less on Ubers (easy to do since I moved closer to public transportation and the weather has cooled off — my Uber spending got really high some months) 
- I’m about to hit my health insurance deductible, which means I can stop paying $320/month for medication 
- dropped my therapy from a $196/month plan to a $49/month plan 
- I pay $275/month to see an out-of-network psychiatrist but that will soon switch to every three months 
- switched my hairstyle to something lower maintenance (had been spending a lot on blonde balayage, but now it’s back to my natural brown color so now I just have to pay for haircuts, not color) 
- also knocked down my rent from $1000 in May to $900 in June-August to now $840 and as of August I’m no longer paying a share of the rent ($300) in the city I lived in before I moved out here

AND ADDITIONAL INFO
Those income numbers are pre-tax. My actual take-home has been about $1400 every two weeks, but that includes deductions like health insurance, FSA contribution, and public transit benefits.

So the top priority is credit cards. Got it. That should have been obvious but I guess I was in denial, idk.

- gym membership ($90/month, will freeze that membership at least for a few months; was on the fence about this because I'm trying to manage some pretty serious mental illness but I guess the financial situation is worse than I realized)
- bank fees and charges (already $229 in October; obviously being more careful is the only way to fix this)
- And a bunch of big one-time things, like I adopted a dog ($200) in September, had moving-related expenses, and found myself in a bizarre situation where I ended up spending $300 on a couple of nights in a hotel. So, the further I get from these items the better my budget should look.

ONE MORE EDIT:

personalfinance,House Poor - suggestions?,"I have lived in my home since 2001. When the home was purchased the first time, I was married and we had two incomes. We were separated (and then divorced) in 2011; in 2012 I refinanced the house in my name, pulling some money out of equity to pay out his share of the divorce settlement. Since then, the house has had about a $300000 rise in equity - it is far and away my biggest asset, and has been a great investment. My 30 year mortgage has a 3.7% interest rate.

However, I'm a public school teacher and a single mom, and the house eats up the vast majority of my income. I love my home, and it's the only home my teen daughter has ever known and we love the community/location as much or more than the home itself. It's bigger than we need, but it's not a fancy house. (Formica counters, not granite, etc. It's not grand in any way, but it is a solid, comfortable, cozy place to live.)

My mortgage is about $2000, plus $300 in a HELOC that I took out to do necessary home repairs (there was a sewer problem/flood last year - yuck!). My utilities (water/garbage/sewer/gas/electricity) run about $300/month, so before repairs or maintenance I spend about $2600/month of my take home salary of about $5000 (using round numbers for all).

I don't want to move, and worry about how this investment is my best/biggest, and how I've earned so much equity over the years (Seattle's crazy real estate market) and if I sell I start losing that; plus the costs to move/realtor fees/etc are so high that it feels like giving away that hard earned equity if I move. I would love to stay here until I'm ""old"" (I'm 50 now) and then eventually sell to get a condo or something when I can no longer do the work of maintaining my home or the stairs are too much or something (hopefully many years from now!).

&amp;#x200B;

I've toughed it out this far: I pay all my bills on time, and I have auto withdrawals for retirement (not included in the take home figure I gave). It's just so hard to save or get ahead when so much of my income is going to the house! I debate all the time, and that's my question here:

&amp;#x200B;

Is it better to be house poor but keep building equity in my much loved home, or to sell and downsize into something more affordable? Thoughts?

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who chimed in! It was interesting to see the various perspectives, and to evaluate my own responses to them (note: I am more emotional about holding on to my house than I thought I was....interesting!). Right now, I'm going to stay here and stay house poor. If my circumstances change in some way, I can change my thinking. I think that I will browse real estate listings to see if there is anything interesting that rises up, and I'll reconsider bringing in a roommate, as ways of bringing in extra money. As a teacher, I could also look at doing a summer job (summer school maybe) to bring in extra income, and manage my cash crunch that way. I've been surviving on this income (or less, I get annual raises) for some time now, so I know I can keep going, and if I'm going to overspend my money I'm glad I'm doing it on the house and not frivolous items with no real value, so at least there's that. For now, I'll stay put, and see if I can keep looking at alternatives to see if something appealing comes up. Thanks all for your input!

EDIT 2: I really appreciate the many people who chose to take the time to respond to my questions with their experiences, thoughts, and input. Thank you! I need to step away from this post to do some chores so I may not be able to respond to additional follow ups, but please know that I appreciate your time and consideration in offering me answers to my question. Thank you again. I will also say this: reading all of the responses revealed the truth of how I feel, as far from feeling conflicted I realized that though I know that I'm house poor, I think it's a choice that isn't necessarily a bad one. My deep roots in my community, the stability that I have been able to give my daughter, and my sense of ""home"" are all immeasurable wealth, and while it's not right for everyone I think it does work for me. I get annual raises so every year is a little bit better. Also, the craziness that is the Seattle real estate market (mostly due to high wage high tech workers coming in for Amazon) is not likely to fade any time soon, so I think the longer I hold on, the better off I will be. Not everyone will agree with me of course, and I did hear the other side, but this is where I am for now. Thanks again, everyone. Over and out!

EDIT 3: I came back after a few days to see lots more posts. Thanks, everyone! I will definitely consider the ADU/rental when my daughter moves out. I've considered AirBnB but I'm a teacher who works 60 hour weeks and I don't think I can handle managing an AirBnB (cleaning, managing questions/reservations) and I also do not want to invite strangers into my sanctuary of a home. What I realized, from reading all of the responses and ideas, is that though my bank account says I'm house poor and if money was the only factor, it would be wise to downgrade...but what I realize is that I'm not house poor, I'm house rich. I'm house rich because I have stable housing in a crazy housing market, because I have deep connections to my community, because I have been able to give my daughter stability through her childhood (which, with my cancer diagnosis/treatment and then divorce....I value stability more than I can say). The house isn't fancy, but it's friendly and warm and close to friends. I'm not house poor, I'm house rich. I can always sell if I need to, I can always rent a room out if I need to, but right now I'm making it and I'll keep doing what I'm doing until that doesn't work. I'm happy here. I value that happiness. I value it deeply. I recognize that this is nonsensical to some people, but it makes sense to me. Reading all of the responses and watching my own response to them let me know for sure where I stand now. Thanks for helping me get to that decision point! I appreciate everyone who replied.

personalfinance,I'm 24 with student debt and received a substantial raise - how am I doing?,"Hi everyone,

I'm 24 years old living in a high cost of living city. I recently started a new role within my company that brought a significant raise and would greatly appreciate your perspective on what I can be doing better. I never used to be great with money and graduated with significant student debt (approx 80k) but with the help of this sub I've gotten on a decent track. I definitely have room for improvement still, so and am very open to any ideas! Thanks for the help, I really appreciate your time.

**High level:**

* Base salary: $126,000
* Bonus potential: 10% (received full bonus past two years, fairly safe bet but treat it like it isn't)
* Student debt: $61,500 total: $55,000 at 4.25%, $3,000 at 5%, $3,500 at 4%
* Savings: $25,500 total: $20,500 in ally bank HSYA (treated as emergency fund/long term savings), $5,000 in BoA checking (treated as money I live off of)
* 401k: $19,000, I currently pay 5% to get their full match which is effectively 4% - just increased my contribution up to 8% but it has yet to go into effect. $16000 is in FDKPX, $3000 is in FXAIX (switched future contributions to invest in FXAIX as I figure I can take on more risk now)
* Roth IRA: $10,500 invested in VTSAX

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly breakdown:**

Net take home pay :  $6,807 (bi-weekly pay is $3142 at current 5% 401K contribution - will decrease once 8% change takes effect)

Savings:

* 401k contribution: $525 at current 5% contribution, next period will be $840 at 8% contribution
* 401k match: $420
* Roth IRA: $500 - realize it would probably be better to fully fund this at the start of the year
* HYSA: $1775

Expenses:

* Rent: $1250
* Student loans: $1100 total, paying the minimum on the 55k loan (approx $1000) and paying $100 toward the other two loans (above minimum)
* Utilities (incl internet, phone): $100
* Subscriptions: $40
* Gym: $35
* Misc household goods: $100 (estimated - need to track better)
* Food: $500 (estimated - need to track better)
* Entertainment (going out, etc): $400 (estimated - need to track better)
* Ubers: $200 (estimated - need to track better)
* Hobbies: $100 (estimated - need to track better)

**Questions:**

* How am I doing ? Any glaring areas that need attention?
* Should I pay down my loans faster? Since the interest rates are fairly low I've prioritized retirement savings
* Should I increase my 401k contribution? I recently increased it to 8% but would consider higher
* How are my 401k/Roth IRA fund selections?

personalfinance,"Bought a car, they ran my credit, it came up more than 100pts less then it is?","Maybe someone could shine some light on this for me.

24F, I’ve always been careful with credit. My dad works at a financial institution and made sure I was set up early with low credit for gas, made sure I paid student loans, etc. I’ve never missed a bill (except one In August when i was between jobs), got myself another credit card to help build credit, all good. I got my yearly credit score in the mail and it said it was 722 back in the summer.

End of September I bought a car, they ran my credit and I was unworried cause I knew my score was good. The salesman comes back and shows my credit score was 615. We just stared at him, he kept saying cause it was a hard pull. I know hard pulls ding your credit but by over 100 points?! I tried calling my dad about it but he wasn’t picking up, and it’s something the salesman wasn’t budging on, he just said that’s what the computers showing.

It’s been bugging me cause I have been so careful. The reason I bought a car now was because I knew I had good credit, and am planning on moving out of my parents in the next year or 2. I had no idea how my credit could drop so low, so I signed up for credit karma today. Credit karma currently says my score is 743.

So did the dealership lie to give me a worst interest rate? Can credit fluctuate that heavily from July to October?? The whole thing is sketchy and I frankly don’t understand. Does someone who knows credit better then me understand any of this and explain it? I tried googling it but nothing similar is coming up.",finance
personalfinance,Financial advice for a 19 year old with debt?,"Hey guys, so I'm not sure if this is a good place to post this but I need some advice on what to do financially. 

HOW IT STARTED:

So, last year I attended a university. I took out loans for $10,000 with Sallie Mae.  
The following semester I was offered federal student loans to finish school(the loans were about $5,000, but I chose to not take it out till I was working a job with more hours. During this time, I was jumping between a lot of part-time fast food jobs since living in a city was new for me(I had to deal with a lot of disturbing things at a lot of places so I kept quitting-- and I'm not saying this to sound dramatic, I mean people would try to follow me home, a homeless man would leave the bathroom door unlocked and pleasure himself in there, people would try to rob us, etc.) and I wasn't sure how to adapt.

At the same time, I had a credit card because I had chosen to try to build credit, so if I needed to, I could take out more loans on my own since I'd have good credit.. and I had a fast food addiction since the dorms were not located near any stores so all that there really was to eat were restaurants and whatever was at the overpriced school store. I'm now left with $1,200 in debt.

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT I'M DEALING WITH:

As of now, I have Sallie Mae payments which are $80 a month, and have received a letter stating that my payments will go up to $130 a month, which I guess I should have known they would increase eventually. 

I have Discover charging $48 a month, plus a $25 interest charge. I usually try to put $100 in each month but because of these charges it just keeps going up.

And lastly, since I didn't accept my college's offer for federal loans right away, they took away the chance for me to use them. Meaning, I have $10,574 left to pay from last semester and no idea how to pay it. Plus, my university is threatening to have the payments moved to a 3rd party collection center which could also affect my credit score(I have a reallllyyy good credit score).

&amp;#x200B;

HOW I'M HELPING MYSELF:

I have been working at a pizza place making $13/hour at 35-40 hours a week(They fluctuate because my manager doesn't like to have people go into ""overtime""). I just got promoted so I'm barely making the $13. And my last paycheck was $740 after taxes, if that helps. 

I, also, took a semester off of school. That way I could try to save and plan to switch to community next semester so I can still get the degree. 

I'm debating either paying off my credit card entirely and using the credit to attend community next semester since it'll only be $1,080 (A huge difference that I should have done in the first place but was too stupid to do in the first place). Or saving as I go, but that means I have to out more money aside that I could have used on my other debt.

Also, I'm thinking of getting a second job, but worry I might get ""burned out"" since I'm already extremely stressed due at the pizza place. And if I did get a second job, I was thinking it might be smart to aim for one that allows for tuition reimbursement? Like Starbucks or Chipotle? Would that be smart? 

I'm just really unsure of what to do at this point and I'm worried. Sorry if this is a lot. I don't really have anyone else I could ask about help, so I turned to reddit.",finance

personalfinance,Should I Cash Out My 401k?,"Hello,

I had worked in the private sector from 2010 - 2018 with a 401k plan. I switched to a public sector job halfway through 2018 and am now accumulating money in a 457. I don't plan on switching back to a private sector job anytime soon, as where I am now is a stable career. The money in my 401k is just going to sit there until I retire from my public sector job and then possibly take another private sector job, but that won't be for another 20-30 years.

What would you recommend I do with the money in my 401k? There is about $15,000. I know that I'd have to pay 10% plus federal taxes to withdraw it. Is it worth withdrawing? Should I put it into savings? Should I invest it elsewhere?

When I discovered this the following day, I visited my nearest branch and was told the bank is ending their relationship with me for reasons unknown.

Since then I've

\&gt;visited several other branches to be told that they will not provide me information as I'm a non member

\&gt;filed a police report for a fraud debit of $11.00 for an amazon purchase from September ( I believe this is why they closed my accounts). Police department told me they 99%  most likely will not look into it, which is understandable.

\&gt;messaged them on twitter demanding an update on the status of my money/accounts since they don't have a contact email, and ""non-customers"" can't use their site to file a formal complaint. The response was ""we cannot communicate with you as a ""non-customer"".

\&gt;filed a complaint with the NCUA stating my issue. Navy Federal responded days later saying ""we have no solution to your problem,""

I seem to be out of options at this point. Is there something else I should be doing or some other entity that can step in and hold them accountable?

If anyone reads this and sees that I missed some vital information that would help you fine people of /r/personalfinance assist me, just let me know and I will edit in the needed information.

I am a 30 year old ""recent"" college graduate, I was hired in September and my starting salary is $60,000. I also have a job on the side as a 1099 contractor. The contracting job pays $14,400 per year. I have a 401k from a previous job that currently has $5500 in it. I currently only have a couple thousand dollars in my savings account.

My debts are as follows:

$2500 left on my car loan at a 2.69% interest rate $6100 credit card debt at 0% APR until December 2020 due to a balance transfer. $38,500 student loan debt at 4.5% interest rate after all my student loans were consolidated.

My expenses are currently 1k per month, but will soon be ~2k per month once I move out of my parents house and move into my apartment in December.

Car note is $280

Car insurance is $200 (state farm)

The rest of the $520 is for various things such as gas, phone bill, internet, food, etc.

My first set of questions are targetted towards the 401k. I recently became eligible to participate in it a couple weeks ago. As stated above I am 30 years old. Do I invest into the traditional 401k or the Roth? Do I attempt to max the 19k with my 60k salary, if not what percentage should I go with? My employer matches 15% of my contributions on an annual basis. Do I hold off on the 401k and pay down my car loan and credit card?

Secondly I have a question in reference to the taxes that I will owe for the side job. Is there any way for me to know exactly how much I will have to pay in taxes? When it was the only job I had, the taxes were pretty low, but I understand that I will have to pay more taxes on the side job because I now have that in addition to a full time job which puts my gross salary at $74,400. I'm asking because it took me some time to find a job and I didn't take out 30% like I did in 2018. In 2018 I would take 30% (knowing I wasn't in the bracket high enough for them to take 30%, I just did that to be sure the taxes were covered and I did it that way to save some money) out of the $1200 per month and set it aside for taxes, but this year I used all of the money to live off of. Maybe there is a calculator for my situation that you guys can point me to? I can't imagine my situation being very unique.

Lastly, I would like to ask you guys how you would go about tackling this debt. First I'm going to pay off the car note as quickly as I can while paying the minimum on the credit card and student loans. After the car loan is payed for I want to hit the credit card hard so that I can get it paid off and the APR doesn't kick in at the end of next year.

I hope I didn't forget anything.

Forex,"Malaysia, a nation who became a trader in the forex market","I just wanted to share what I've read. It made me realize that anything can happen in the forex market.

It was today that I learned that my country's central bank called Bank Negara was involved in forex trading back in 1992. It was all done by the bank Governor and also Finance Minister at that time. Basically the central bank and the government were in cahoots to make a profit trading in the forex market. I've read that they used Bank Negara employee computers as well as their own to execute their HUGE position. In the range of billions of dollars.

In the year 1992, they went into the market buying sterling pounds in hopes that they go up. During that time, the Bank of England (BOE) was in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and was basically playing the cat and mouse game and trying to one up the Deutsche Mark. This resulted in low interest rate and very high inflation in the UK.

Enter George Soros, a hedge fun manager at that time who saw that the pound was severely overvalued and decided to short it. His position was fairly large, in the range of tens of millions of dollars. Bank Negara was basically on the other end of that trade, in their mind there's no way some small hedge fund could bring down a CENTRAL BANK. So they kept their long position on the pound until Wednesday September 16th 1992 came when BOE had to pull the pound out of the ERM because of the financial pressure that had built up from within. This made the pound plummet and cemented two things in history. That day is known today as Black Wednesday and George Soros was crowned ""The man who broke the Bank of England"" by making a profit of US$1 billion in a single day.

As for Bank Negara? Investigations were conducted within my country and the estimated loss of that trade was around US$10 billion. In other words, a lot of our nation's money went into Soros' pocket. Bank Negara was also reported to be insolvent after that loss and had to be bailed out by our Ministry of Finance. They did that by selling shares of MAS (national airline company), Telekom (national telecommunications company) and Tenaga (national utilities company). MAS had been struggling in the airline industry ever since. Both the bank Governor and the Finance Minister were relieved of their duties.

The losses had since been recovered but the whole incident effectively pushed the advancement and development of the country by a few years. Bank Negara had stopped their trading for profits activities ever since and sticking to only regulating the money supply, as it was intended in the first place.

That's a piece of my country's history and how it was tied to the forex trading world and the rest of the world events. Thank you and hope you had a pleasure reading.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

**The Demands of the People** 

For decades we have been ruled by corrupt politicians who have done nothing but steal our livelihoods, drive us away from our homes and rob us of our very identity.

And for decades, we have stood silent, oppressed, and idle giving them one chance after the other to treat us better, but all they have succeeded in is drive this country to ruin and systematically destroy our unity, our pride, and our future only to stuff their pockets and fill their bank accounts.

But now, and for the first time, we the people have risen up as one to take our future into our own hands and change the destiny of our country, our lives and our children.

This time we will not yield and we will not surrender, and we refuse to be suppressed by the empty promises of the politicians who continuously lie to silence us and act like they care to win our trust.

My fellow citizens, we are angry, and we are fed up, and our protests are just and worthy and shall be answered.

We vow that we will not leave the streets and plazas until all our following demands are met:

I. Immediate resignation of the current Cabinet.

II. After swift parliamentary consultations, appoint within 48 hours a transitional Cabinet with no confessional or political alignments, tasked only with holding early Parliamentary reelections within one month.

III. Hold Parliamentary elections without any political pressure, influence or threats of any kind according to the recent proportional electoral law and under international monitoring and supervision.

IV. The new parliament elects a new President from outside any of the current political parties and alignments.

V. A new Prime Minister is named and a Cabinet is appointed from young and qualified people who are not aligned with any of the current political parties.

VI. This new cabinet shall immediately begin to adopt and address, and within two months make sizeable progress in, the following demands:

1. Freeze all suspicious deals and laws that were passed by the previous cabinet(s).

2. Put all the corrupt people from all sectors on trial, including those from the judicial system.

They have a tight sense of family; 19yo, 22yo, and 27yo plus 27yo fiancé are all under one room with the inlaws. My wife is the only one who lives on her own, with me.

I work for the feds and there is a excellent daycare, run by employees of my facility, on site where I work that is both very affordable and good for the kids who go there. Lots of activities, the teach the kids sign language, reading, etc. My wife is a healthcare professional who's starting income is about 160k/year and she's planning on going back to work next week. To help with her schedule and my schedule, we were planning on putting our kids in day care (under 2yo) for TWO days a week, 5hrs a day. Nothing crazy. Our goal is to pay off our house in the next year and a half before the 3rd kid comes. Great. 

Fast forward to last night, my wife is talking to her parents about the situation and the day care idea comes up.

""Everybody pays their house off in 30 years, why do you have to do it differently?"" ""Why do you have to do this to our grandchildren?"" I could continue but you see the point.

I noticed College Ave provides an option to do one time payments with credit cards and doesn’t have any fees associated with it as far as I can see. So my thinking was if we are going to be able to comfortably pay off the loan in the next year, would it not make sense to get a 0% intro apr credit card and make a one time payment for the whole loan amount? Then I can easily pay off the card within the promotional rate and save money on interest. I don’t believe this will count as a balance transfer on the credit card since College Ave accepts Credit Card payments without fees. Is there anything wrong in my way of thinking?",finance

Figured I would post on here and get some advice. I took out a loan on a car a few months ago and over the course of a few months the car shit the bed due to unlucky circumstances (according to the mechanic). 

The issue is now I have negative equity in the car. Additionally I owe the mechanic $5k to fix it up enough that I can trade it in. I had the mechanic fix it up and then I had the car appraised. I’m looking to walk away losing $5k on the car. I also need to figure out a way to pay back the mechanic ( it’s currently paid on a cc).

I don’t want to keep the car any longer as now it’s become a money pit. My idea is this - Taaffe in the car in exchange for a new car and have the dealer pay the mechanic as well. I’ve gotten options for leases and financing the new car. 

My question is this - should I lease the car with the $10k tack on or should I finance the car (they are basically the same monthly payment) though I’m thinking with financing I could renegotiate the interest rate and bring the costs lower. Plus I would like to keep the car to take with me abroad in South America some day. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance
investing,Hungarian government securities with 4.95% interest available for EU citizens,"There's a relatively new government security called MÁP Plusz which pays an annual 4.95% interest rate for 5 years, which is available for EU citizen retail investors. (The same treasuries for institutions yield around 1.2% anually.)

I believe this security has an exceptionally high yield, considering that the average mortgage or lombard loan loan rate is around 2-3% in the country, the current short term interest rate (BUBOR) is 0.21%. This opens an opportunity for arbitrage.

The risk can be considered low, as the government debt ratio is 68% and decreasing, GDP growth is around 5.1%, the highest in the EU.

The only real risk I see is currency risk, but as I see this can be hedged using EUR/HUF currency future hedges, which chip away about 0.65% from the yield:[https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/fx/emerging-market/euro-fx-hungarian-forint.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/fx/emerging-market/euro-fx-hungarian-forint.html)[https://www.theice.com/products/119/Euro-Currency-Pairs-Euro-Hungarian-Forint-Futures](https://www.theice.com/products/119/Euro-Currency-Pairs-Euro-Hungarian-Forint-Futures)What my problem is that I only found these 2 future products, and they are both illiquid. I've used EUR/USD futures often in the past to hedge currency risk, but those had tens of thousands of trades per day, these hardly have any.

So if this could work, I could essentially have an EUR based secure goverment security with the yield of 4.3% for 5 years, which is exceptional.

In exchange for this info, can you suggest an instrument I could use to hedge the currency risk? I'm just a regular retail investor using Interactive Brokers as my broker right now.

personalfinance,Pay off mortage?,"Hi,

My spouse and I are in our late 50's and I'm trying to decide if I should use a portion of our passbook savings to pay off the mortgage.   Here are more details.

&amp;#x200B;

|Expense|Amount|Interest rate if applicable|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Mortgage payoff |42000|3.87(I think)|
|Mortgage/month|1200||
|Passbook savings |56000|really low|
|Expenses/mo:|\~3000||

We used to get a tax break on the mortgage interest but last year we took the standard deduction.  I haven't followed tax law very close but assume we won't have that available any more. 

If we chose not to pay off the mortgage I'd probably max out Roth accounts for both of us. 

We are fully funding our 401Ks and overall our retirement accounts(except for maybe the Roth) are good I think. 

No car payments, but we drive older cars in decent working order.  

My spouse has a credit card bill.  I'm not sure how big it is.  It's a very very sore topic between us so I avoid bringing it up.   :)  I should post a question on r/relationships or somewhere, but not here.  

We both work and could easily live off of one or the other of our incomes. 

At least part of the reason I want to pay it off is for psychological reasons.   Neither of us feel that secure in our jobs, but honestly it's hard to tell if those are rational feelings or just stress. 

We are both mobile and healthy enough.

Both employers have insurance available. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does it boil down to whether we think Roth accounts would outperform the 3.87% we pay on the mortgage? Plus the peace of mind?  We could easily convert the mortgage payments to Roth ""payments"" and still have peace of mind.  Right?

Since my income after tax will only be about $2400-2500, I'd like to know if it would be worth it to refinance some of my private and student loans together and combine them to take advantage of the lower loan rates offered due to the Fed Funds rate being lowered?

 I have excellent credit around 760.

I'm thinking that the Fed Funds rate dropping will likely lower the rates of the creditors and for those with the best credit to under 3.0% fixed so I should easily be able to get around 4% or lower and paying that over the next 5-6 years would save me some money. I would be paying around 500 and may increase my payments by 200 dollars each month so long as other expenses don't come up.

My govt loans total about 21.6k and each loan is 4.66% totaling 7.2k and 3.4% totaling 7.8k and 3.86% totaling 6.6k. I rounded for simplicity.

If we could leave Politics out of the conversation as those who have mentioned to me that they will be forgiven under the next presidency don't understand economics and the tax required to pay that off.

I'd like to know everyone's opinion on this subject. I would also like to know if anyone has gotten a great rate. My current income yearly is around 50k after OT so that may not qualify me for the best rate. If this is the case I can easily pick up a 2nd job and bump that up to 65k/year.

personalfinance,"Grandparents spent outside their means over several years - Trying to Clean the Mess, Please Help","Hi Personal Finance,

I recently became responsible for my grandparents' finances due to my grandfather's illness and my grandmother's lack of technological or financial knowledge. My grandfather has been far too generous to the family and spent well outside his means over the years. Their finances are a complete and total mess. I am trying to help give advice to clean up what I can, but it is overwhelming. This is in Louisiana, a joint debt and property state.

Below are all estimations of the debts within \~tens of dollars and the interest:

Store Card #1: $6,000 @ 27% APR (Over the credit limit by 20%)

Store Card #2: $600 @ 29% APR

Store Card #3: $3,050 @ 28% APR

Store Card #4: $1,000 @ 27% APR

Store Card #5: $1,000 @ 26% APR

Credit Line #1: $10,500 @ 27% APR

Credit Line #2: $3,000 @ 20% APR

Credit Line #3: $1,200 @ 0% APR first 12 months

IRS: $1,000 @ 5% APR

Personal Loan: $6,600 @ 12% APR

Total Credit Debt:  $33,950

&amp;#x200B;

Immediate Expenses:

Home Loan: $142000 @ 4.5% APR (\~$1000 monthly payment)

Car Loan: 30000 @ 2% APR (\~$585 monthly payment)

\~$1500 monthly  misc. expenses (energy, water, phone bills, internet, insurances, etc.)

Total Immediate: \~$3100

&amp;#x200B;

They make \~$7,000/month in retirement net income. When my grandfather passes, I am unsure which funds will be available to my grandmother. She makes \~$800/month from Social Security.  I know she will get a part of his VA benefits, Pension, and Social Security. I expect my grandfather will likely pass by Christmas. We are unsure what the life insurance payout will be or if there for sure is one.  We have been told he may have 2 life insurance policies, but my grandmother has not gotten all the information on that yet. His funeral will be mostly paid for by the VA.

Without making them eat ""pork and beans,"" I have cut a few unnecessary monthly expenses and I am helping them trim as I see fit. I have been more or less ""snowballing"" the debt on the higher interest, lower balance credit lines. So far, I have helped them pay off 4 cards in full over the last 2 months and this is the mess that's left. They also have one small property which is in the process of being valued to sell as soon as possible. It's a little \~1 acre camp (not much, but it will help).

My plan right now is to pay off Store Card #5, #2, and #4 next month and go from there. I am trying to make them pay somewhere around $2000-2500 extra in payments on debt each month, as that is what they have left after what I would consider immediate expenses (mortgage, car, groceries, utilities, insurance, etc...) I am trying to do as much damage to the debt as possible before he passes and there is not as much income. Does anyone have any advice or see something I don't? Should I work on paying off Store Card #1 first since it's over the credit limit?

Thank you!

Usually the ones that just want a one time large deposit for a certain amount of time. I generally stay away from recurring direct deposit stipulations. 

  


What are best practices for moving money between accounts? I like to use Alliant ACH to push and pull and for the fact you can add a lot of third party accounts where other institutions limit you? I understand they have an outgoing ACH limit of $25k so maybe there is a better bank to use for us frequent bonus chasers, especially those doing $50+k deposits?

  


Or do you suggest just sucking it up, paying the fee, and doing a wire transfer? Perhaps there's a bank with either (a) free wire transfers and ability to ACH push and pull as much as you want or or (b) an app with ability to deposit checks via mobile up with no limit? Or maybe mailing checks is how you like to do it?

Hello, this is my first paper preprint:

**Privacy-preserving Federated Bayesian Learning of a Generative Model for Imbalanced Classification of Clinical Data**

Though it is not fully biased toward deep learning, or federated learning on a edge device, I made a new framework for learning a global model in a horizontally distributed setting, especially in a clinical field. 

AFAIK, it is the first trial to apply Approximate Bayesian Computation(ABC) on federated learning.  
(If not, please let me know!)

Without complicated perturbation techniques e.g. Differential Privacy, Homomorphic encryption, Hashing, etc., the proposed method can preserve privacy.

===

As I said in the paper, unless each local site reveals trained weights and the structure of Autoencoder, shrunk data CANNOT be recovered in the central server. Also not possible even if some local sites conspire against the other site to disclose the information.

* But this is my hypothesis and expectation, so I want to listen to some feedback or opinions on this.  
Is it really impossible to make leakage on data shrunk by local autoencdoer?

===

Plus, a global model can be learned in the central server with the minimal information (merely with a distance between local data (perturbed via Autoencoder) and generated data (same dim. with the perturbed one)).

Welcome and thank you in advance for any feedback and questions!",technology

The block of land is $175k and I know we wouldn’t be able to build on it until we paid off the car loans (4.5 years away approx).  A house would cost approximately $350k. Our rental income would increase $5 per week every year and when/if we move into new house the house we are currently in would get approximately the same rental income. When we got the cars we decided to get car loans rather than refinance the houses so that they were paid off faster. As I knew we would draw it out longer and end up paying more. We will have to use our equity on our current homes for the deposit for the land. We will also have additional expenses from the land sitting there of additional rates, land tax, water (connection). 

We are planning on starting a family soon so I will have to go on maternity leave at some point (paid in australia thankfully) but after that there is child care expenses. Unfortunately I don’t really know how much child care really costs as the government rebates are very expensive so if anyone can let me know please chime in!

Our current houses are both also perfect for constructing a 3 bedroom unit at the rear or each (no body wants back yards any more) Cost approx $225k each, rental income $350+ per week each once constructed. However this is a plan for further down the line. 

I have a meeting with a mortgage broker Wednesday so I don’t even know if the banks will lend us the money. I would really like to gauge if others think we are spreading our finances to thin and risking everything in buying the land. The land really is perfect for what we want (acreage, out of town) and I’m scared we will never find another block the same price (blocks normally $180k+ for quarter acre block). 

I am the financial decision maker so the decision is really all on me.

We got pretty far into the process with Quicken and cancelled the loan due to a very low appraisal (houses across the street are selling for over 100k more than they appraised our home), and the seemingly exorbitant closing costs (20k). 

I have 2 questions... 

1. Are closing costs of 18 - 20k reasonable for a mortgage refinance? 

2. We were considering refinancing to a 15 year mortgage but our payment would go up approximately $300-400/month. My spouse and I are in our early 30's. Is it worth the higher monthly payments or should we just ride out a 30 year mortgage?",finance

My fiancée already owns her own home.  She bought it for about $180k and has something like $45k in equity in it.  She's five years into a 30-year mortgage at \~4.6% (she did a 10% down option.  No PMI, but the interest rate was high-ish at the time).  She would like to refinance to a 15 year.

We're getting married next year and need more space.  We're looking at building a new house for around $350k to $400k with 20% down on a 30-year mortgage.

We both make about $100k per year with no debt other than about a $500/month car payment each (and she has her mortgage, of course).  We both have excellent credit scores.

Ideally, what we'd like to do is refinance her house together now (to keep and rent out after we move) and also buy the new house together when it's done being built (say 7-9 months from now), but I'm not sure what the credit implications of this might be.  

I think that the two of us buying her house now and then another house later should be equivalent to her refinancing her house now and then me buying the new house later, credit-wise, but I'm not sure and I was curious--from an interest rate standpoint--what's the best financial decision, or should it not matter?

Thanks!

Edit:  For clarity.  And to summarize: the goal is to keep her current house indefinitely and rent it out.  I would like to have both our names on both the mortgages (so we both own half of each house).   From a debt-to-income ratio hit that my credit will take by suddenly having half-a-house of debt, will that recover in 7-9 months when the new house is done and it's time to close so that we don't have to pay higher interest rates than whatever the best rate is at the time?

Since my wife is currently not working and I took a pay cut, does it make sense to use this emergency money to free up around $372 a month since I will no longer have a car payment?  The interest rate is 2.5% through IFS.  Originally the loan was 63 months but I paid additional principle.  The loan is around 49% paid off and was originally for around 20K.

7000 in checking account

Expenses:

14151 in student loans @ ~4.5% (all around that percent, all federal, about half is subsidized)
13000 on car loand @ 7.29% ( 6 yr loan)

Sorry if I'm not following the correct format as I don't post much. Any thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Sell or Rent the Primary House: Moving from a LCOL to HCOL for work.,"I live in a LCOL area where I have been a homeowner for 2 years. Got a house with 0% down.

I have a 5-year ARM on it, which will have it's interest rates updated in 3 years.

I am moving from GA to WA, so I am nowhere near the property, if I decide to rent out the house. The AC unit (\~10 years old), roof (\~10 years old) and the bathroom will need some work, in the near future, IMO.

How do I go figuring out whether to rent out or sell? I will probably make $10k in profits, if I sell right now and walk away with that profit and a lot of peace of mind. 

However, if I rent, I expect the monthly payments to go up, because of an increase in rental vs primary home insurance. But, I can possibly cover that new payment via rent. If so, how long do I own the house? Till the ARM is re-adjusted? Till the house is paid off?",finance
personalfinance,Is my father screwing me over? Basically tricked me into signing my sister's student loan,"Thanks in advance for any insight you may have.

I am a 33/m, and six years ago, my dad asked me to co-sign my sister's student loan for 1 semester. The loan was for $22,000. When asking me, he said there would be ""no shot ever"" that I would pay a dime of it. I never signed any paperwork, and to be honest, I am not sure I was told the correct amount the loan would be for.

Fast forward to today. The loan is now $24,740, with all but $200 being principle. It is a private loan, through fedloanservicing. I never signed to be a co-signer, but if I were to contest myself being a co-signer, I would be implicating my dad in fraud, which I am not sure is necessarily accurate here.

As a matter of full disclosure, my college education cost my parents $250,000. Some of that was my fault, for sucking in high school, and them not asking for aid when I got waitlisted at the school I really wanted to attend. Some of it is his fault, in my view, for not applying for aid when he was clearly eligible after I had already been settled in the school.

For the past 4-5 years, I have given my dad $150 per month toward my student loan. He keeps telling me that my sister's student loan is going down, when it is not. I tell him that fact, and his responses are always the same: He either tells me ""well, we paid $250,000 toward your school"" or gets mad or just ignores. My mom is totally unable to get through to my dad here.

I asked my dad today if he is OK with me putting the $150 I ACH him monthly for my loan toward my sister's loan, and he said no. He has said no to this every time I have asked over the years, and has always refused to give a reason why.

My dad is 67, in bad shape physically, very overworked and has no will. He owns property around the state in which he lives, rents it out, but I am not at all aware of his assets beyond that. He keeps everything completely opaque. I think he is just overwhelmed and delusional optimistic, but shit happens, he could drop dead at any moment, and no one in the family knows where his assets are. My mom does not make nearly enough as an assistant teacher, and push comes to shove, I would rather eat the loan myself than take money away from her. 

I really wish there was a way to get the hell off the loan. I called fedloanservicing a few years ago and was told there is no way to do so. Curious if anyone has insight into how I should proceed. Sitting him down for a heart to heart is not possible, as I have tried dozens of times and gotten nothing but attitude. I feel like I should get an official will for myself, so they see how tardy they are in getting their stuff in order. But my priority is not paying for my sister's loan.",finance

List price was like $22,500. I was approved for financing for 4.74% for 72 months, $3000 down. Payment was going to be $357 per month. 

So then the finance guy starts trying to sell me the extended warranty, service plan, gap coverage. Monthly payment would go up to $421. I said absolutely not I can’t afford that. Kept saying that, he kept “punching numbers”. Got rid of gap, got rid of service agreement.  Something happened because we were Costco members??? I don’t even know. It was all a blur. Somehow got down to a price that would be $407. My husband was leaning towards getting it because it was a rental car, the guy kept saying how there are 74 computers operating the thing, if they break its thousands to repair. Also they threw in the maintenance oil change thing for “free”.

Aaaaanyway.  We fell for it, agreed to it. Was about to sign everything when he realized he didn’t have our down payment factored in, so the price actually came down to $367. Sure, fine, that sounds fine, let me leave.  But when i was signing the final stuff I saw that the terms of the loan had been changed to 5.99 % for 84 months. 

At this point my kids had been miserably waiting for two hours, I’d changed 4 poopy diapers, the finance guy was like “the difference over this small of a loan is only a few hundred dollars over the term of the loan, it’s better to have a smaller payment for longer” etc etc.

So we signed it, and now I wanna puke. I know it was stupid. 

So, after reading posts, I’m pretty sure I can probably cancel the warranty, and it will get refunded to the lender. Buuuuuut, there is also a 5 day money back guarantee... I’m wondering if I could/should take it back under that guarantee, just so I can get a new loan with my original 4.74 terms for 72 months?

All in all I realize this is just an expensive learning experience, and I’ve also learned to get a babysitter when buying a car.

personalfinance,Young with a small windfall - where do I park it?,"Hi everyone! Hoping for a little financial advice. My grandmother was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness and has gifted me $15k in cash. She asked that I do a little traveling and be smart with the rest of it, so I want to do just that. 

I'm 24 with a good job (and ...decent? spending habits) so I'm excited to use this gift to start learning how to build wealth for the first time. Hoping y'all can impart some wisdom! 

By the numbers:

* Debt: $14k car loan at 3.65% ($300 monthly payments for 5 years)
* Emergency fund: $6k (about 4 months' living expenses)
* Retirement: $27k in a Roth 401k, contributing 8% (my employer matches up to 6%)
* Residual income: Just enough to add $300 or so to my savings monthly and take a few trips, because travel is extremely important to me

From what I've learned lurking here and elsewhere, I think I have a few options:

1. **Pay off debt:** Deplete my car loan, although the interest rate is pretty low and it feels like a pretty unceremonious way to use my grandmother's gift 
2. **Save:** Max out my 401k contribution and supplement any income gap with the $15k while it sits in a money market account
3. **Invest:** Put the cash in an S&amp;P index fund or a CD ladder and let it grow until I'm ready to start thinking about buying a house (maybe 5 years from now)? Maybe put $1-2k in an interesting opportunity like [Fundrise](https://fundrise.com/) to see how it fares?

As for traveling - I'm taking an exciting trip later this year out of my own disposable income, so I want to save/invest/use wisely the entirety of her gift. :) 

Am I missing anything? My first instinct was to pay off the car, but it just seems like there are other options that will provide more long-term benefit with compounding interest or a chance to learn something about investing. Thanks so much for any advice.",finance

I sold a condo before the 08 crash to move for my partner’s new job and rented. (Lucky me!) The relationship didn’t work out but the sale sure did. I work in nonprofits and I’m convinced that lucky house sale was the single biggest creator of wealth I’ll see in my line of work. 

Fast forward a bit. City, job, and new relationship status are all perfect. When we decided to have kids we wanted to stop renting, the rental market here is terrible and we calculated we would save a lot per month by putting our cash into a home. (Plus schools and commute were better) We bought a cheap fixer upper, we live exactly where we want, but in exchange the house needed serious work. It is not in condition to resell without repairs but it’s perfectly livable as-is.

Thankfully with the price sale difference, we kept out 100k from the condo sale for the repairs and still had easy mortgage payments (1070/month at 4.5% interest rate) and the housing market has gone up to give us solid equity. 

Now we finally have the permits and estimates and are getting started on repair work, and we realized it’s all going to cost more than we hoped and want to refinance to properly pay for the repairs. BUT we added a few smaller loans this year to try and keep cash liquid for the contractors AND THEN my spouse just got laid off. 

Should we roll our assorted loans into the home refinance? or keep them separated and snowball them one at a time? Or something else entirely? 

Here’s what we’re looking at:
74k left of the current home mortgage at 4.75% with probably 300k in equity available right now. 
16k left on a car loan at 4.9% over 5 years
14k left on a roof loan at 2.9% over 10 years
11k in initial project expenses on a project credit card with 0% interest for 23 more months 

111k liquid assets
Somewhere around 200k worth of repairs :(
An initial quote of 225k for a mortgage refinance at 4% for 30 year or 3.625% for 15 year with 3500 closing costs. 


We estimate if we can keep the total project less than 250k (so the ~200 +14 +11 so far) we’re bringing the trashed house up to baseline enough that we would break even or better in a future sale. It’s not upgrades - it’s taking it from selling it now as a tear down or gut project to a home that’s in the top 20% of the neighborhood. Kinda like gutting and flipping it ourselves, except we just want to live here. 

TL;dr We need to refinance and I don’t know if I should use it to pay off all the little loans we ended up with getting to this point.",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,"I’m in debt, and want to invest to pay it off, good idea ?","So the general Idea is to invest what I can and assuming my investments are growing at a percent higher than the interest rate on my student loans I should be good

So…. I figure per month I can scrounge up $600 to put toward my debt. To make the minimum payments I have to pay $259 per month to the bank which leaves me $341 from that $600. Now I take that $341 and invest it with a $2000 principal in some safe mutual funds or stocks. Assuming I make 6% (which I feel is very generous) that money will turn into $20’988 in 48 months. By that time, my amount owing will be $21’058. That means, the following month (month 49) I walk into the bank with $600 cash (that i would of been investing) and walk a debt free man. 

So you know, the interest in my debt is +0.5% on the prime rate, which makes it 4.45% right now.


If i didn’t do this, I would have to pay $744 a month to be done in 4 years or pay $600 a month for 4 and a half years. So i am essentially shaving off half a year of paying my debt. Which at $600 a month is $3600 in my pocket as opposed to the banks. Or saving $144 a month over 4 years which is $6912. I did the calculations and I think it is a solid plan.

Let me know what you guys think because I can’t seem to find any information on if this will actually work. I know it is riskier because I am relying on the economy a little here but I figure over 4 years it would be hard not to consistently yield around 6% given that the average online says it common to see 10%.",finance

personalfinance,"22 years old, 7.5k in debt, 44k pre-tax job that offers no retirement account. Need advice on how to approach.","Hello,

I am graduating this December and will be taking a job at a small business that pays about $2500 a month after taxes starting in January. Being a small business, they don't offer a 401k so I assume I'll be opening my own retirement account out of college. The only real benefit is a decent healthcare coverage reimbursement, with things like holidays and vacation spoken for. I have a $5500 unsubsidized loan with an interest rate of 5.05% (grace period for 6 months after graduation though) and a CC with $2,000 on it. With rent and living expenses taken into account, I'll have about $1,000 remaining. I'm not sure how to allocate this $1,000 so I'm looking for advice. 

After reading through the forums, I believe my course of action is to first pay off the CC debt then create a 3-6 month emergency fund. After that, I'm not so sure. Should I open a Roth IRA and contribute the rest to that after my minimum payments towards student loans since my interest rate is 5.05%? Do I put any money into a high interest savings account to have on hand or is that considered part of my emergency fund? I'm also planning a return to graduate school by next semester (August 2020) or the following semester (January 2021) to advance my career. I'm not sure how this would play into where to allocate my savings as I would need a decent amount saved up for that. In the meantime, I will definitely be looking for a job change that offers more money and benefits. Thanks so much for the advice.

EDIT: I should not have mentioned graduate school as in a full program, I meant a part-time year long certificate program that would allow me to take on a slightly-higher paying job that would give me much better experience and room for growth as my current job is low ceiling with it being a family business. This program would cost $5000 for tuition",finance
personalfinance,How CC Balance Segments and Payment Allocation Actually Works,"I saw a ULPT that mentioned that cash advances charge you your Annual Percentage Rate immediately post withdrawal and realized how few people might understand this. I've worked in credit for 6 years, working as customer service and retention for credit cards as well as working as a credit analyst dealing in line increases and decreases. I've worked for 2 major international banks specifically dealing in credit cards. 

How a credit card works is you have 3 balance segments associated with your credit account. There's purchases, cash advances and balance transfers. Purchases are generally the lower rate, cash advances average anywhere from 24.9% APR to 31% APR (although it can be lower if you have good terms) and balance transfer rates are generally special promotion rates, or at your assigned purchase rates. 

When you swipe your card, that balance is added to your purchase rate. So long as you pay your statement balance in full every month, you are not assessed interest on that balance. Now, let's say you go to a bank, hand them your credit card and ask for a $500 cash advance. It's approved and you have $500 cash in hand. When you withdraw your cash advance, you have a $1,200 purchase balance that you were intending on paying in full this month in order to not be assessed interest; *however*, the withdrawal of the cash advance forfeits your grace period and you are now assessing interest on both your purchase segment AND your cash advance segment. 

To break it down, if your purchase rate is 12.9% APR, you are now being charged something called your daily periodic rate. What this means is you're being charged 12.9% APR divided by 365 days in a year. Your daily period rate is .0353% interest, averaging out to about 42 cents per day on a $1,200 purchase segment. You also have a cash advance segment with a $500 balance assessing interest at 24.9% APR. 24.9% APR divided by 365 means that your cash advance segment of $500 is assessing 0.0682% interest which totals out to 34 cents per day.

Both of those calculated interest costs are based on you no longer using your credit card. If you make a payment or a purchase, it'll affect how and what you pay using a payment allocation method (minimum payments are applied to your lower interest rate segment, anything greater is paid to your higher interest rate segment). 

Now, obviously in this scenario, you were intending on paying in full anyways. So, you do. However, since the grace period was forfeited, you're still responsible for the interest assessed during the cycle. As well, with any interest assessments caused by a forfeiture of your grace period, it can take up to 2 statement cycles for you to not be assessed interest anymore. 

Tl;dr: Cash advances cause you to be assessed interest from the get go until paid off on your entire credit card balance, regardless of your past payment history of PIF. Can take 2 statement cycles of PIF to get you back to not being assessed interest.",finance

personalfinance,How would you approach my college situation?,"Hi! I am a 21-year-old college student and right now I am in my last semester at a community college where I am graduating in December and will receive my AA in Psychology. I recently got accepted into a 4-year school's exercise science program, which I could attend for my spring 2020 semester.

My family is dirt poor.. and I mean dirt poor. While this sounds like a bad thing (..and it is), this has allowed me to received more than enough financial help for colleges. I actually made close to 10k off my financial aid from attending community college for 2 and a half years because my TAG covered the whole community college costs and my federal Pell Grant just got dumped into my bank account. If I go to the 4-year school and commute, this luxury actually still somewhat applies, except I will be receiving about $200 a semester left over in my bank account and not over $2k. So, all in all, I still would be able to attend college for free and receive my bachelor's degree for free because of how poor my family is.

I have been working since April 2017 and I have about $6k in my savings. This should be a lot higher, but I have to pay for everything because of my family's situation; I receive absolutely no financial help. My parents provide me with food and a roof on my head, which is more than enough of what I could ask for. However, we live in a very small house and therefore, I have absolutely no privacy. Essentially, I would really like to live on my own and date some women. Living away at the 4-year school I got accepted into would allow me to do this, but that would require me to take out a student loan. The thought of having a loan and having $0 to my name absolutely scares me given the circumstances my parents are in.

Another scenario I have thought about would be to take a gap year and work full time at my job. This would allow me to save an absurd amount of money, but also limit my social life and probably fuck with me mentally. However, if I do this, I'd be able to live on my own at the 4-year school for at least a year without taking out any sort of student loan.

I know the clear answer may be to just commute, get my bachelor's and continue working at my job, but that's why I am posting this. Because it is not so clear to me. I really, really want to progress in terms of learning how to live on my own and having the privacy of my own place. Not only that, but I believe living on my own would improve my self-discipline skills. I get good grades (3.6 GPA) and keep up with work, but I still think I could be doing a lot better and I feel the environment I am in makes that harder for some reason. Also, I'm not sure if I even see myself using my degree for my career, as I have a ton of my own ideas I could work on with the money I would make working full-time (YouTube channel, creating an app with a game I see potential in I could buy for $900 outright, a drop shipping idea, and training to be a pro wrestler as that was always my dream).

personalfinance,Repay 401k loan via IRA contributions after leaving job,"I have a friend who is quitting her job this month, and she just called me because she has a loan on her 401k there with a balance of about $4k and they of course informed her that she'd have 60 days to repay it or they would count the balance as a distribution and she'd owe taxes and penalties on it. 

So far, nothing surprising. But I did some digging and apparently the 2017 tax cut law made a couple of new provisions for cases like these. First, you now have until your tax filing due date to repay the loan:

&gt; “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly extended the window to repay or roll over an outstanding balance on a 401(k) loan when a borrower leaves an employer. Effective for tax years beginning in 2018, the deadline is now the due date of the employee’s tax return for the year in which the distribution occurs, including extensions.” ([CreditKarma](https://www.creditkarma.com/tax/i/401k-tax-reform-loan-repay/))

Second, apparently an alternative to making your payments to your old employer's plan is that you can put the repayment into a separate IRA:

&gt; Plan sponsors may require an employee to repay the full outstanding balance of a loan if he or she terminates employment or if the plan is terminated. If the employee is unable to repay the loan, then the employer will treat it as a distribution and report it to the IRS on Form 1099-R. The employee can avoid the immediate income tax consequences by rolling over all or part of the loan’s outstanding balance to an IRA or eligible retirement plan by the due date (including extensions) for filing the Federal income tax return for the year in which the loan is treated as a distribution. This rollover is reported on Form 5498.” ([IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-loans))

So it _sounds like_ even if her old company plan has no mechanism for loan repayments outside of payroll contributions, she can create a new IRA at Vanguard or wherever and either pay back the loan by contributing to that IRA or (somehow?) rolling over the loan balance into it. If she gets an extension on her taxes she would have until October 2020 to pay off the whole thing.

Can anyone explain in practice how this would work? How much of it still depends on cooperation from the old employer? How is interest handled (presumably she still needs to pay some interest)?",finance

I am currently on a 6-month break from the tech industry and am in position for my return. In the meanwhile I need your advice with the following questions:

1) I have always thought about reducing my MSFT stock and converting into the more diversified Vanguard account. With MSFT at a near all time high should I be converting half or all of this stock into index funds?

2) The liquid money in my online bank is... quite excessive. Given my interest rate is quite decent - should I be keeping this money on hand to invest in the event of a recession? I've always heard cash is king when the market is down and thought that keeping it here is a prerequisite of that.

3) Very much a personal one here. I'm an extremely ""family first"" person. If you were in my shoes to what extent would you financially aid your family? Specifically should I be paying my separated parents rent $1.5k per month each? Should I be paying their credit card bills and groceries? My parents are fiercely independent about paying for themselves but I believe they have normal financial headaches that I feel I could easily aid with.

I had never thought he would have such a large amount and am really scared. I always thought he had very manageable credit card debt but this is beyond crazy.

I want to pay it off so that he is completely debt free but I'm not sure how to go about doing this. I read that we could do a balance transfer onto my credit cards and I would have about 15 months with no interest to pay it off. I'm interested in the no interest option because my religious beliefs forbid taking interest. I think I could pay it off in that time period since I earn about $150k a year. But are there some hidden fees or tricks behind this? Seems too good to be true.

Or would it be better for me to take a personal loan of $50k to pay off his debt with the loan and then pay off the loan and it's interest? I'd rather not do this due to the interest but I'm ready if I have to. I personally have no loans and have fairly good credit (credit karma says 700ish). I feel completely overwhelmed by this debt since I had no idea he had such a large amount. I really need to find a way to pay this debt off in a way that makes us pay very little interest. Could someone please help or guide me on this process?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: 

Thank you all for the help and advice. I think I've had some time to process what my father told me and I've calmed down a bit.

For people asking why the debt occurred - it was because of failed business ventures that just didn't work out due to the 2008 crash and then subsequent ventures that also failed. It wasn't due to gambling, drinking, drugs or any other vices - just plain bad luck. I didn't know about these issues because I have been living away from home for 8 years (school and first job) but now I'm back.

As for budgeting, my father earns no money and is basically retired. He owns a house worth $365k but is having trouble finding a buyer (he put it up for sale a month ago to get money to pay debt). My parents have moved in with me 3-4 months ago (apt cost is $2199 a month near Oakland, CA). So I basically pay for all food, utilities and everything.

This is my plan of attack: Balance transfer debt to 3-4 credit cards (\~15k per card) or put all in 1 card if possible and hopefully get 0% for more than 12 months. After tax and other retirement stuff, I get about $8200 a month and after rent I have basically 6000. If I pay $4,200 a month to the cards and the remaining 1800 can be used to support me, my wife and my parents for food and stuff. At this rate, I should have it paid off in 1 year or a little more.

Let me know if this doesn't make sense or if I missed anything. I'll be very honest I have never had to do any budgeting or personal finance management of any kind until now so I'm worried I'll miss something small and not be able to pay off the debt or worse be charged back interest on the initial amount for the entire year.",finance
personalfinance,Investing Student Loan,"Hello, I am in a fairly unique position where I am offered a $5,500 federal subsidized loan and can pay for college with cash. My thoughts were that I should take this loan and use that to pay for school, and use the equivalent amount that I would've spent in cash to either pay off my car loan or invest in either government bonds or low risk corporate bonds. I have a car loan for a little under $8,000 at a bit over 6% interest which I was planning on refinancing to 3ish% soon, so I was thinking pay off that before thinking about bonds. I think I will get a similar offer next year, so I'm asking for then as well. I have no other debt besides current credit card debt I pay off every month.

So far as I know, this is completely legal since I'm not investing the student loan itself, I'm using the amount that I would've spent on school and instead of putting that to money-making activities. Also, My car loan is 4.5 years remaining, so I imagine the savings in interest would cut that down by quite a bit in equivalency. I would then plan to keep making equivalent monthly payments into either my high interest savings account which is 1.9%, or the bond idea above.

I've thought about this a fair bit, but I ask you all if this is a good idea, or if I am better off not doing it. The potential I could make is a minimum $1,300 over 3 years I think with almost no risk, or very little.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: The interest rate on the loan is 0% while I am in school + 6 months after I graduate since it's a federally subsidized loan, so they pay the interest during this time.",finance

personalfinance,"Have enough money to pay off my truck, but should I?","So I recently inherited money -- $15,000 -- nothing too crazy. I've read the FAQs and Windfalls articles, but my specific question is: Should I pay off my vehicle? My plan was to pay off the truck and then put $300 a month toward student loans instead. (This $300 was previously for my truck payment, and I haven't been making payments on student loans for a few years because of my PayAsYouEarn plan through FedLoan).

Where I'm running into struggles is that my truck loan interest is only 2.7% while some of the loans for school are at 6.5%. I know it's a general rule to pay off higher interest first. Except my total student loan amount is about $40,000, and it feels so desolate to just sink $15,000 into that without really seeing any difference (Essentially... $15,000 disappearing into an abyss). Thus, my desire to pay off the truck.

personalfinance,Should I Balance Transfer,"Sorry for the long post, this is all theoretical I just wanted to bounce it off you guys and see if it's a smart idea or if I'm missing anything important.  

**Situation:** I'm still paying on student and auto loans, about $12k left. My original plan was to pay them down as quickly as possible (currently that's about $1k per month *in addition to the minimums*, roughly $1280 monthly to include minimums).  

Currently in the military (this question isn't military focused but job security is relevant here I feel) and will be for at least the next 2 years (after which I plan to get out). I have a Chase Sapphire Reserve card (no fee, waived for military) that I currently use, probably *not* to it's fullest extent (I travel, but not a ton). I plan on cancelling this when I get out as I won't travel as much and will be charged the annual fee.  

My budgeting is fine, I've got a good emergency savings and I typically have ~$1400 left over each month after all bills (including minimum loan payments), retirement, food, etc. This leaves up to ~$400 monthly (after paying the $1k extra on loans) for entertainment, savings (building up emergency savings even more, recovering from unexpected expenses, etc). Anything not spent goes towards the loans again (the total extra amount fluctuates between $1k and $1.2k or so monthly).

**Potential Plan:** I'm considering opening another card (such as the Citi Double Cash Back) for 2% on all purchases (rather than Chase which is the equivilent of 1% from non-travel/restaurant points, 1.5% if those points are spent *on* travel, and up to 4.5% equiv. if I take full advantage of points gained from traveling and also spent on traveling).  

*If* I open the Citi card and have a high enough limit (my Chase opened w/ $18k and my credit score is better now than it was then), I can transfer my student/auto loans to the Citi card for 18mo of 0% interest. Doing the math, at 18mo of 0% interest it would take ~$667 in minimum payments to pay that off before the 0% goes away. **This means instead of paying all extra I can every month on my loans, around $1300-1500 accounting for minimums + extra payments, I would instead have a minimum payment of $667, but I could then invest the extra $600-800 in my retirement accounts monthly for those 18 months (I'd probably play it safe and only invest $500 extra so I have a cushion as my minimums are higher)**.  

**Question:** Given the above (2 years guaranteed paycheck, dropping from 4.5% and 5% interest rates to 0% for 18 months, etc) do you think stretching my payments out to 18mo at 0% instead of about 11-12 that I am currently doing is a good idea?   

Keep in mind that even with the 3% transfer fees I should pay less over 18 months @ 0% than I would pay for ~12 @ 4.5% and 5%...and that's not accounting for the larger return I should get from higher retirement savings.",finance
personalfinance,Buying house with parents/gift funds/advice,"Semi-complicated scenario here.

So my parents are getting older (late 60s) and one idea we have been discussing is purchasing a large house where we can all live together.  Unfortunately they are having a hard time maintaining and getting around in their split level and the problem is only going to get worse as they get older.

There are obviously non-financial considerations, but specifically I'm here for financial questions.  If I buy a house I want to do it just in my name.  I currently make $100,000 a year with reasonable expectation that continue growing higher and low risk of unemployment (federal employee).  Am I correct that my parents could gift me the down payment, let's say $80000 on a $400000 house, without either of us owing any taxes?  It seems pretty easy for me to qualify and afford a house in that price range with that sort of down payment.  My initial thought was if they bought into the place so to speak with the down payment they could live their without any mortgage contributions.  I also have some liquid cash, around $15000 if needed, currently as an emergency fund, and more in 401k's.  No debts of any kind.

For reference my parents have about $600000 in retirement and own their house worth $200000 roughly.

Any other financial considerations here specific to the scenario I'm missing?  I'm not naive to the non-financial things to consider here as well.  Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Need help with college finances,"Hi all,

Some backstory to explain what's going on: I graduated high school in 2017 and went into University A right after. I filled out my FAFSA and all that good stuff. Throughout the semester, I kept having problems with my financial aid, needing verification. I did everything I could on my own to get it fixed, but ultimately the problem lied with a discrepancy in my parents' filing status and marital status (mom and step father are married, mom filed Head of Household, step father filed Single). Obviously, I can't fix their taxes for them, but they didn't want to listen to me when I told them that it was their mistake and so it never got fixed. I never got any financial aid for that term, and the balance fell on me to pay off. Meanwhile, a financial hold was placed on my account.

Fast foward to summer 2019, and I'm honestly sick of being not in school and rotting away at home, literally paying for my parents' mistake (they either don't realize or seem to care that I'm in this situation because of them), so I made plans to go to another university, Uni B, just so I could still recieve schooling. I came across a similar problem with verification, but was able to get it sorted out this time. Unfortunately, I couldn't go in as a degree seeking student and could only be admitted as a non degree seeking student as University B required me to send in official transcripts from University A, which I can't do cause I still have that hold.

As a non degree seeking student, I can still attend classes, but I'm limited to 15 credits maximum on my account, and, I didn't realize until after I'd been enrolled, but I'm already locked out of almost all forms of financial aid since a large majority of it require that I be classified as degree seeking. Fortunately I was able to get a loan for the term through Sallie Mae so that I'm not completely SOL by the end of the term.

Now, I realize that I probably shouldn't have gone back to school given the position I'm in, because I'm still paying off the original balance from University A. So what I want to know if there's anything I could do to help ease my burden? Or did I really just dig myself further down my grave?

For information:
- University A balance is currently $11,602.39. It actually already got sent over to a collections agency, but is thankfully being not reported. And there's no interest being accrued and charged. I'm on a payment plan paying $263.39 every month.
- University B loan is $6800 with a fixed 8.375% interest rate, though I've already applied $500 towards my account. I've chosen the interest payment plan to keep long term costs down. Funds have not been disbursed yet. 
- I have a 48 month auto loan currently at $9,351.45 with a 9.24% interest rate. I'm only 2 months in.
- I currently work full time (I'm only taking two classes currently. I may not continue schooling into next semester) at $11.50/hr with an extra $1k/yr from a health insurance waiver. About $24k/yr gross.
- I do have credit cards but I always pay them in full so I'm really not worried.",finance

crypto,Can we do password hashing on the *client*?,"The problem is pretty simple: you have one server, many many clients. Or you fear DOS attacks. Whatever the reason, using a slow hash on your server is just too resource intensive. We don't want to reduce the security of the hash, so I thought, how about having the *client* do the work?

The idea is simple. You start with a password:

    p455W0rd

The server sends you the… err, random, salt:

    1122334455667788

You hash the password and the salt *on the client* with a slow hash like Argon2i:

    c1c440e02b813348235c2f1f21c15ccc
    fc0a3a387e16632cfed6c21f4c89dc29

You send that to the server, which then uses a *fast* hash (like Blake2b) on it:

    df184e89344665bac33d0220b08a7727
    9ea515c5496763adba520cf4d22539b5

The server finally compares that to the database entry, and you're in. Or not. :-)

---

So, the database would still contain a hash and a salt, but this time the server doesn't hash the password directly, but 32 pseudo-random-ish bytes, which cannot possibly be brute forced. The only thing that *can* be brute forced is the password itself, so you can get the right intermediate hash. But that requires the slow hashing password we performed on the client!

_(Possible variants: also add the salt to the intermediate hash before we get the final hash. Or use two salts. Or hash the password alongside its intermediate hash. I don't think it would change anything, though.)_

So we'd get as much security as if we'd done the slow hash on the server. Potentially *better* security, even, because the client often has more CPU cycles to spare.

One obvious application would be web sites of course, but JavaScript crypto opens its own can of worms… Until the experts tell us it's okay, or Web assembly is up to snuff, or something, that should still useable on dedicated clients or phone apps.

personalfinance,Need advice on a bad financial situation,"I just want to preface, please don't tell me how stupid, irresponsible, and dumb I am because I've been telling that to myself for four years. I'm almost ashamed of what is going on (hence my throwaway). So about four years ago, I bought a car. I put down $1k. It was a 2007 Nissan Versa hatchback and it was about $9k. My credit wasn't great and so they slapped me with a 14% interest rate, a $364 monthly payment, and they also installed a little device on my car so that if I missed a payment, they could shut it off. I was estranged from my parents during the time and I had very little financial literacy. I know in hindsight that it was a TERRIBLE deal.

personalfinance,Borrowing on house value to invest in shares when interest rates are extremely low,"Hi, I'm looking for advice on what I know is a risky idea. 

I'm 27 and own my first home with my partner. We have a mortgage of \~370,000 and the property is worth 680,000. Our mortagage is 54% of the value of the house. It's an apartment completed about a year ago and we moved in just after completion.  

The current payments for the mortgage take up 32% of our income. I've read about gearing and want to get back into shares. I invested inheritance money a few years back in shares, which grew and subsequently paid for the house deposit. I have considered the idea of taking money out of the house value to invest in shares while interest rates are at all time lows. The interest rates in my country (NZ) are at 3.49% or lower and are falling and expected to fall further and our mortgage is up for renewal in about 6 months. 

If we took out around $50,000 our repayments would then take up close to \~35% of our income, if interest rates held constant, which is affordable for us. We currently save 20% of our income on top of mortgage payments and we have an emergency fund of 7k (growing). 

The interest payments on that 50k would be around 3.5% and by all accounts historical returns on the share market are higher than that interest rate. I know that that could change and the past is not a guarantee of the future. We could still afford the payments, even if share values went down, and we would also recieve dividends. Our home loan would be \~62% of the house value which is not too huge. 

It obviously has a lot of risk, but we have no big financial plans in the near future and could happily pay the repayments for 5-10 years if the stock market went down to re build value if needed. We are both likely to increase our incomes in the next 2-3 years as I complete my PhD and my partner finds her next job. We don't want to leverage to buy more property because it's too much work to maintain for us right now.

Looking for advice or tips on anything I have not thought of here.",finance

personalfinance,"Lump Sum Mortgage Payment, Does it Make Sense?","I know this question gets asked quite a bit on this forum. I also know that 95% of the time it doesn't make sense. However, I think I might be close to that 5% where it might actually make sense, but please tell me if I am crazy. I will be keeping numbers rounded for easy math. 

First, a few things about our situation: No other debt currently - Plan to keep the house another 4-6 years at most - Will buy another house at that point - Have other assets that have a tax burden (so the homeowner's tax credits help) - Married and file jointly

Essentially, we recently came into possession of about $100k from a family inheritance. We have $290k remaining on the principal of our mortgage (first-time buyer) which has a fixed interest rate of 3.5%. We are 30 months into our 15 year mortgage. We tried to pay it off as quickly as we could without overburdening our monthly budget. We worked hard to save and were also very blessed to put about 40% down on the house. So if we used this gift towards our mortgage, we would have basically about $190k left on a $550k purchase price (that was recently estimated by the city at $640k). We do not get charged fees or penalties for paying off early through our credit union. We currently have a mutual fund that is another option to put this money, but it hasn't performed all that well lately (right below the 3.5% interest rate over the past 6 months or so). We are fairly risk-averse when it comes to investments, but I feel like we could be doing better.

My thought process:

I understand that 3.5% is very small and should be easy to beat in the market. However, our fund hasn't performed well in 2019 and I have seen a movement by financial managers to move money to cash lately with uncertainties in markets over the next 24-48 months (which is probably how long we will keep this house). 

We will continue to receive some tax benefits from the remaining mortgage payments and we do not have any other higher interest debts for the foreseeable future to pay down.

The housing market in my area has been arguably the hottest in the country over the past 5 years, and is ripe for a downturn/flattening at some point. Would that have any effect on this decision?

However, does the front-loaded interest schedule really mean that if I pay off the mortgage early (say in the next 3 years), that the interest rate on the principal paid off early ($100k) would have been more like 2/2.5%? 

I am no expert in these matters, so I appreciate any insight or thoughts on the topic!! Thank you.",finance

This is probably a dumb question, so bear with me. 

So, I know that according to the yield curve, as the time to maturity increases, as does the yield to maturity.

However, I also know that an increase in the interest rate causes a decrease in the present value of a bond over longer time horizons. 

What would be the purpose, then, to invest in long-term loans if the present value will just be lower? Doesn't the yield = interest rate? If it's higher, wouldn't that be a bad thing, not a good thing? Why are higher yields more ""attractive"" for long-term bonds?

The plaintiff signed a contract for the purchase of a miner through a company called Coin Miner, and therefore asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit.

There is no precedent in the US courts on how to measure or define the delay and the loss caused by the undelivered bitcoin miners, but the court in the case said that it is “premature to dismiss all the lawsuits now”, and the case is expected to become the first in the United States. a case.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Best Financial Strategy House Purchase/ADU Build,"I'm considering buying this property in a popular small city with a relatively strong real estate market. This property has a great location and big long term potential upside, imo. Description: on the more desirable side of town with better access to the most fun attractions locally. 1/4 acre with a 19 year old mfg home, no garage.  Price: $400K. The idea would be to move in, get settled, enjoy it. 1st major project is to build a garage with an ADU on top, estimated cost: $200K. Eventually the idea is to move the mfg home off to another piece of property to create a rental and build a new home on the property, maybe 10 year plan. Financial resources to get in: $275K plus another $75K to come over ten years at $7500 a year. Goal with these resources is to buy and then get the garage/ADU built ASAP to create the additional revenue stream. Question: so how should I use the money across these two initial goals of buying the property and then building the garage/ADU? My first thought is to put as much down as possible to get to a very low monthly payment. But will that put me in a situation where I have to borrow money at a higher interest rate to build the garage/ADU? So is it a better strategy to put a smaller amount down on the house, say $75K and then hold the $200K and use it to build? Are there other strategies I should consider? 

All input is appreciated. Thanks to taking the time to read this and offer your collective experience and wisdom. Thanks f/personalfinance!!!",finance

personalfinance,"Yet another ""can we afford this house?"" (numbers/info inside)","My wife (32) and I (33) are first-time homebuyers looking to buy in the Fort Lauderdale area of South Florida.  It's a relatively HCOL area.  We both have stable/secure government jobs with a set salary, no bonuses, and a small raise every year.  We both have a 401k-like account through our jobs but are each only putting 3% (max allowed, employer adds ~3.5%).  Credit scores are 795 and 810.  Both have a 6 month emergency fund and, in addition to that, $58650 total cash saved for down payment (15%) + closing (4% estimated).  We've already found a lender and have been ""pre-approved"" and the highest interest rate we've seen over the last month for us was 3.99%.  

House in question: great neighborhood (safe, all residential no businesses, quiet, low crime, lots of cops live there, less than a mile away from $1M+ homes), 3bed/2bath, ~1650 sqft, 1 car garage, screened-in pool.  Roof is ~13 years old, AC is 8 years old, pool pump 4 years.  Has hurricane shutters and garage door, working sprinkler system, pool in good shape.  Inside is not ""updated"" but not in bad shape, current owner still occupying.  Recent sales of similar homes in the area range from $320k-$360k (though those were ""updated"" and have newer roof/AC/etc.).  Current list price is ~$320k.

Now for the numbers:  
Current rent: $1650  
Average monthly **take-home** pay **$6187** (from the last 14 months of YNAB data)  

What we think our max price for the house we're looking at should be: **$305,000**

Breakdown of the estimated monthly costs of this house follows - estimates done using formulas from property appraiser, lender, research, friends with pools, etc.:  

* mortgage: $1236.21 (15% down, 30 year fixed @ 3.99%)  
* homeowner's insurance (estimated): $260  
* Taxes (estimated): $374.17  
* PMI (estimated): $35  
* pool (maintenance + extra electric, estimated): $200  
* **TOTAL: $2105.38** (34% of take-home, ~29.7% gross)

For projected monthly expenses we took our current budget and doubled the electric bill (currently renting a ~1500sq ft 2-story townhome), averaged in yearly things like Amazon Prime and birthday/xmas gifts, included overestimated fun money ($100 personal for me, $300 personal for her, $150 for restaurants/entertainment), a monthly repair budget of $381.25 (1.5% cost of home per year from Reddit's rule of thumb of 1-3%), and every other bill we can think of from YNAB and our personal costs (cell phones, hair cuts, etc.) and we come up with total monthly expenses, not counting the house, of **$2508.96**.

That leaves us with **$1563.66** left over every month.  ~$2k if we don't spend the ""fun money,"" which again we overestimated.  We also do not currently have a car payment or any children.  Her car is 5 years old and in good shape, mine is 14 years old and needs a few small things but is otherwise running fine.  I have ~1600 budgeted for any unexpected car maintenance and have included 75/mo in the calculations above.  We do plan to get a dog and are open to having children but haven't officially decided to ""try"" yet.  We're both also looking to change careers to increase income, but that's not happening in the next 6 months so we're using current numbers.

I know that 305k is above the standard ""gross pay x3"" thing but that price here would get us a money pit or a shack with a missing wall.  We do not want to buy a condo or townhome and we no longer want to rent.  A decent townhome down here is around 200k and the monthly HOA fees can be $400-500 so you may as well buy a house.

So, would you be comfortable offering $305k using the info above?",finance

personalfinance,Valuing a Pension Plan,"Hi PF,

I (27M) applied to the RCMP (Canadian Mounties) last year, have gone through the long application process and am expecting an offer to come sometime soon. In the meantime I am a manager at a factory in a protected industry in Canada (great steady job) and I was just offered a pretty big promotion that puts me in the running to eventually run one of our plants one day.

I have no idea how to properly value the RCMP pension plan.

The RCMP have a pension plan that pays up to [70% of the average of the top five of consecutive years income.](http://rcmp-grc.pension.gc.ca/act/rnsrgm/apr-pe-eng.html) For every year you are a mountie, you earn 2% towards this pension. A regular member salary is currently $86011 annually. RCMP must resign at age 60, so I  would top out at $55047.04 annually in retirement given 32 years service and a 64% entitlement.

How do I go about valuing this pension plan? $55k annually over a 20 year retirement is 1.1 million dollars. ~~Using a compound interest calculator, at a 5% interest rate, It says I would need to save $35,000 a year for 32 years to save up $1.1m. Is $35k per year in extra income a fair way to value this pension plan?  (~~**sorry my math was wrong)** In that case the RCMP is probably the better option,

Most savings accounts offer an interest rate in the 0.01 - 0.03% range which (*I think) is too low and with inflation is actually going to make me lose money.

**Childhood:** I come from a middle class family, where my dad works in maintenance and my mom is a teacher. They are average savers. They're 55 and only have around $350k saved. My dad will have a pension of about $2k/month because he's work for the fed gov't for about 25 years. One thing I'd like to add is that my parents were very good at pushing me to get decent grades, participate in activities, and generally enjoy myself. However, we only went on 2-3 vacations throughout my childhood which is a major driver for why I want to travel as much as possible while I'm young. I recently hiked in Rocky Mountain National Park and I'm going on an international trip in January courtesy of my ignup bonues from Chase credit cards!
____ 

**College:** I received a half-ride scholarship at a local liberal arts school. I got a degree in economics and finance. I also graduated with $50K in student loans. My parents weren't able to help with the cost, but they did let me live at home for 2 years during school. This helped, although rent in my area was around $350 a month so it wasn't a huge boost. I've been smart my whole life, but I do have a tiny amount of regret of choosing the expensive liberal arts, private school rather than a public university. I essentially traded $50k in total school loans for the opportunity to play basketball (D3 and no scholarships for athletics). I could have went to an in-state school 15 miles away for free due to my ACT score. To make matters worse, one of my coworkers I started with graduated from that school I could have gone to for free (and probably gotten paid after some other small scholarships). Oh well, it all works out in the end and I'm content with my decision. Throughout college, I worked at a local retail store earning around $15 an hour. It was hard to find something better that had flexibility around basketball season. 

_____

**Post-grad:** I graduated with a GPA around 3.85 which allowed some flexibility while job-hunting. I actually signed some documents (over email and adobe) accepting a job offer at a mid-tier consulting firm for a salary of $53,000. However, I soon realized that 50-70 hour work weeks would be my reality, and the recruiter saying ""But they cater in dinner for free!"" wasn't a good reason to stay. I went on a summer recruiting retreat with this company and employees would tell us about how they worked from 8 am to 9 pm during crunch time. I decided to take a completely new route. 

_____

**First (and only) job:** I decided to apply for a job with the federal gov't out of Wisconsin. I now work for the US Treasury as a federal regulator in the financial industry. My starting salary was $56k and I've never had to work more than 40 hours a week. After 2.5 years, my salary is now $68k. I should note that I also get per diem and mileage reimbursement when I travel. This probably averages out to about $5k in additional ""income"" each year.  Benefits are outstanding and include a 10% retirement match, free healthcare, free vision, and free dental. I've essentially traded the possibility of making &gt;$100k doing consulting or public accounting for the security net and benefits that comes with federal work. No one who made it through the 1 year probation period as been fired from my district office for more than 20 years (seriously, it's insane).

 Be careful applying for a gov't job in places like Denver, NY, or San Francisco. The geo-pay isn't nearly enough to make-up for the crazy cost of living in those areas. I feel like a gov't job is especially great in LCOL or MCOL areas like mine.

**I bought a house:** Last fall, I purchased a 3 bedroom/ 2 bathroom house. It's a fairly nice house but certainly in a dodgier part of town. I wasn't planning on buying at that time although I had plans to buy a place and rent 1-2 rooms out to help cover my mortgage expense. I wanted to wait until this spring when I had more money saved and was better ready. I looked at 10+ houses to get a better feel for the market. I came across this house and I loved it. The problem was, I only had about $5k in liquid funds. The house was listed at $240k and I offered $240k with the stipulation that the seller paid closing costs (I simply didn't have the cash). She somehow accepted, and I began trying to come up with ~$8k in closing costs required for my 3% down payment. I ended up borrowing $2k from my Uncle, who really helped me out. My parents probably could have swung the $2k loan but it wouldn't have been easy. I paid my uncle back, with interest, over 6 months. So now I owned a house! It was an awesome feeling. My mortgage was around $1,600 including taxes, insurance, and PMI. I started looking for a couple renters for my 2 extra bedroom. In my area, rent is wild so I knew I could have success finding renters to cover most of my mortgage. I ended up finding 2 renters who paid a total of $1,500 each month. I used TransUnion's Smart move website to do background and credit checks on potential tenants, which I highly recommend. So bam, now my rent/mortgage expense is closer to $200/month. We also split utilities 3 ways. I've spent approximately $1.2k in maintenance and repairs over the last year. I have about $11k in equity now. Not really even worth mentioning at this point. Oh, and I already had to refinance, which sucks. My original rate was 5.00% in November of last year (highest peak) and I refied down to 4.00% a few months ago. Cost me about $1,800 out of pocket and increased my loan amount by about $1,000. 

_____

**Monthly budget:** It's not the norm for this sub, but I don't really budget. Owning my home and having renters is absolutely the ONLY reason I get away with this. Basically everything here is a guess. I use CC's almost exclusively (primarily for sign-up bonuses and free travel) so I can get a rough estimate of expenses. Yeah, I know I could be doing much more in the saving department. But in my eyes, I'm living a darn good life while also setting myself up for the future. 

_____

**Estimated monthly expenses:**
Mortgage and utilities: ~$200 (1 bedroom apt rent is about $1100 here. I used to pay $850 when I split a 2 bedroom with a friend) 

Student loans: $400

Retirement contributions: $600 (work matches around $500)

Dining out: $400  -Yep. I travel around 2 weeks/month for work and I also eat out a TON). I could bring food when I travel but damn it's nice to eat at the top rated cafes and restaurants in new cities I frequent.

Groceries: $100 (I typically only eat at home on weekends or on some nights when I'm not traveling)

Car payment: $350 (2017 sedan, paying off in 4 years @ 3.5%. I enjoy having an above-avg car especially since I have to travel for work) 

Car Insurance: $150

Gas: $60

Phone: $60

Gambling: $100 (whoops. Sometimes I win though!)

Breweries, happy hours, dates w/ GF, etc: $100

Travel: almost fully covered by credit card points and rewards now

personalfinance,How do I know if now is a good time to refinance?,"Eta: I gathered numbers on my mortgage, still working on the numbers for my student loans, and I talked to an advisor at Quicken and seems like refinancing is a really good decision for us right now. They can save us about $250 a month and knock out my loans. Thanks for the advice and non-biased doses of reality! 👍🏻

Bear with me - I'm not great at numbers &amp; financial stuff but was hoping for advice.
We still owe probably $65k on our home, our loan is a FHA 30 yr fixed with a pretty low interest rate but I can't remember exactly what it is right now (we bought in 2011 at $72k if that helps). Due to our escrow account being emptied recently, and us not having the funds to completely fill it, we pay a little over $800 a month for our mortgage payment. I *think* we'd have about $100k in equity in our house but it does need some cosmetic stuff done.
We had a decent (for us) savings before kiddo was born but chose to pay off the hospital bills in full so that reduced our savings by about 85% and I'm fighting to hang onto that for emergencies. We've reduced spending everywhere and were just barely making ends meet on one income. I got a raise, and our mortgage went up to that $800+ amount the same month.
The debt we have is the house, our 4 yr old van, another (surprise) medical bill of about $4k, and....my student loan debt which has been an albatross around my neck for a decade now. Yes, I should have buckled down &amp; paid it off by now and I really regret not doing so but it is what it is. The gov has started keeping my tax return because of it, so I know I need to do something about it. I've buried my head in the sand about it for many reasons, so I don't know exactly how much it is. I'd say $25k maybe?
So could we refinance the house &amp; take a cash-out option to get some stuff paid off &amp; fixed up? What questions should I ask of a lendor or financial person to figure out if this is the best choice for us? Honestly, just having the debt paid off would be a HUGE help.",finance

After having been shoved back and forth between agents at Discover, I’ve been told that the wire was rejected on 10/16. However, because of the bank holiday and that prior long weekend, the wire department was backed up on wires. I was given the timeframe of 5 days from 10/16 to receive my money back at the originating bank.

Come today, I was told that the wire had JUST TODAY begun processing, but the wire team was still “very busy” and even AFTER Discover pushes the wire through they have to send it to the federal reserve, get a tracking number and then send it back to the originating bank.


This is gearing up to take much longer than 5 business days, and I’m at my limit. The agent said I can’t talk to anyone in the wire department, and management would relay the same information. They said they’d call me today if they have any more information 

I’m incredibly angry with both banks, but Discover is clearly dragging their feet here and I don’t know how else I’m supposed to speed this process up if I’m basically unable to reach anyone. I’m tired of being told I’d be called back and then nothing, I’m tired of waiting until both wire teams leave for the day, and the fed to close forcing me to wait another fucking day to get anything done, and I’m TIRED of everything being pushed until the weekend, just to have to wait and start this process all over again the next week, as if I don’t have my own job to do.

solar,Question about solar taxes,"I apologize if this is a common question. I did look a little and didn’t find an answer.

We are looking to do a diy install of a 6kw system on our garage roof.  We have been talking to wholesale solar and it looks to be about a$9000 investment.

My question is about taxes. The way we have our withholding set up, we receive a refund of about $2500 each year when we file our returns. With the 30% federal tax credit, would this mean that we would get a refund of roughly $5500 or am I missing something? Obviously, this is a deciding factor. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

We have done our own taxes with TurboTax so me do not have an accountant to ask. Thanks in advance for any help or advice!

Maybe this will help:
We are married with 1 child and own our home. The mortgage interest has never been enough to factor into our taxes. The standard deduction is always the best number.  We put 0 for deductions on our federal tax forms. Our household earns about $100k/year",energy

investing,Federal Reserve Repo Operations is Quantitative Easing,"I keep hearing that these are just overnight operations and only involve treasuries.

They are not all overnight loans. Looking at the Federal Reserves website there is numerous longer repo loans ""term repos"".

In fact, looking at the last 25 Repo operations 25% has been longer than 1 day (not counting the Friday ones that are not paid back until Monday).

October 10 - 2 weeks (42.6 Billion), October 11 - 6 days (21.150 Billion), October 15 - 2 weeks (20.1 Billion),  October 17 - 15 days (30.650 Billion), October 22 - 2 weeks (35 Billion)

Less than 2 weeks the Federal reserve has injected more than 100 Billion (not counting the overnight repos) and I didn't go back further to add more. In addition, they released a statement today that they are increasing the ""term repos"" (next one tomorrow, and then Oct 29th) to ""at least $45 billion."" So this number will be increasing.

I would wager that the trading being attempted is not treasuries and either agency debt or MBS that banks are not willing to take on because of some risk involved and the low interest rate.

Job Income:

\- $150-180k/yr, depending on bonuses and side work

\- 401k: Employer match \~700/mo

Expenses:

\- \~$2700 rent/utilities/internet/etc

\- $50 car insurance

\- $1500/mo discretionary purchases

\- $500/mo student loan

So I live quite comfortably. However, I've racked up a lot of credit card debt. I'd like to save some money paying down. It is just from being inattentive about my spending, not buying clothes on sale, eating out too often, things like that. I also did not receive what is normally a large bonus last year, so my usual strategy of paying the year's expenses in December backfired (I quit shortly after). I've modified spending habits; Mint helps a lot (it was quite an eye-opener to have an app explain to me the truly horrifying amount of money I spent on alcohol on any given month). My debt situation:

\- $12,000 cc debt @ 19%

\- $11,000 cc debt @ 21%

\- $6500 unsecured debt @ 7%

Other facts:

\- Total line of credit is $85,000, so my utilization is actually very low (relevant to interest rates if I borrow)

\- Roughly $14k in cash

\- \~$120k in 401k holdings

\- Young-ish; in my 30s (this is relevant in the case I consider borrowing against 401k)

Obvious advice is just spend less and throw money at it. However, I am not in a povertyfinance situation and want to enjoy my lifestyle and pay down my debt gradually. I could save thousands with a lower interest rate. I have considered:

\- Borrowing against my 401k (low interest rate and pay myself back)

\- Unsecured consolidation loan

Updated Oct. 23, 2019 8:07 pm ET

Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.35% posted a surprise profit for the third quarter, easing investor fears that the electric car maker’s pursuit of growth and record production figures would come at the expense of the bottom line.

The electric-car maker said Wednesday that it would continue to be profitable, but cautioned that new products could affect the company’s margins.

Tesla’s shares climbed 20% in after-hours trading.

The company said trial production of its compact Model 3 car has started at a new facility in China, and production on its new Model Y compact sport-utility vehicle is ahead of schedule, with a launch set for next summer. The China facility is another sign of Tesla’s ambition to become a global force in car production.

Tesla posted earnings of 78 cents a share for the three months ended Sept. 30, upending analysts’ predictions for a loss of 46 cents a share. For the year-earlier quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.75 a share.

A record delivery figure helped lift Tesla’s bottom line, as customers largely flocked to the lower-price Model 3.

But even as Tesla ramps up Model 3 production, sales of its premium cars have declined.

Third-quarter revenue fell to $6.3 billion from $6.82 billion a year earlier, as deliveries of the Model S and Model X vehicles dropped 37%.

Analysts polled by FactSet had predicted revenue of $6.43 billion.

The company said it is on track to deliver more than 360,000 vehicles in 2019, the lower end of its targeted range of 360,000 to 400,000.

Tesla has had back-to-back quarters of record vehicle deliveries this year after failing to meet estimates earlier in 2019. The company needs to deliver at least 104,800 vehicles in the three months through Dec. 31 to meet the lower end of the projected range.

Tesla has made significant gains in its yearly production—a crucial part of Mr. Musk’s strategy to become a mass-market auto maker. The lower end of the projected range compares with deliveries last year of almost 250,000 cars. Tesla will have to finish the year with another production record to meet its target of at least 360,000 deliveries this year.

But even as Tesla gets closer to showing it can consistently produce large volumes of cars, it faces the prospect that market dynamics might be shifting as demand slows. Tesla faces the elimination next year of a federal tax credit to its customers, a change that analysts say could affect demand.

What’s more, industry experts fear overall demand for new vehicles might be about to slump after a prolonged growth period. Demand in China and Europe already is showing signs of weakness and the appetite for new vehicles in the U.S. could be in jeopardy, analysts have said.

New vehicles often help generate sales interest among reluctant vehicle buyers. Tesla said it will produce limited volumes next year of an all-electric semi truck the company unveiled in 2017 and is starting to install equipment for the Model Y. The car maker also said it would soon announce the location of a new factory in Europe.

Tesla, which initially rolled out the luxury Model S large sedan and Model X SUV, has shifted its focus to the Model 3. That smaller car accounted for about 82% of the 97,000 deliveries the company made in the third quarter.

Tesla has said it wants the Model 3 to be a mass-market car and has priced the vehicles accordingly. They cost less than half the price of the premium models.

The starting price of the Model 3, which Tesla has been working to bring down to $35,000 by shedding jobs and closing facilities, is currently listed at roughly $39,000 on the company’s website, excluding projected savings from gasoline and tax credits.

Despite price reductions, Tesla said its gross margins improved through cuts to manufacturing and material-related costs. Its operating expenses are at the lowest level since Model 3 production began, the company said.

Sales of the Model 3 boosted Tesla’s free cash flow, a metric considered important for the company’s health because it supports operations and helps the company maintain its assets.

Tesla recorded $371 million in cash flow for the third quarter, compared with $614 million for the three months ended June 30. The car maker’s cash reserves totaled $5.3 billion

The opening of Tesla’s China facility comes as car sales in the country, the world’s largest auto market, have slumped.

A slowing Chinese economy has pinched sales for major car makers, including in the electric-vehicle market, where sales fell 11% in the third quarter.",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing Mortgage - Need help deciding,"Hi guys,

My wife and I currently have a VA home loan with an interest rate of 4.25%. We currently owe $146,xxx on the loan and I've planned to pay off the home by Dec 2025. If the plan goes on par, we will be looking at spending a total of $169,xxx from Dec 2019 to Dec 2025 with interest and principal. 

I decided to look into refinancing options as the interest rate is pretty high for a VA loan and I was able to get two options without needed credit checks or an appraisal. 

2.875% interest rate with fees totaling the loan amount to $152,500 30 year va fixed

Or

3.5% interest rate with fees totaling the loan amount to $148,500 30 year va fixed

I've been playing with numbers all day and cannot decide which to go with. If I plan on paying it off by 2025, the 2nd option saves me like an additional $3.000. If I go with the 1st option, and pay it off by 2025, I save only like $1,000. The caveat is If for some reason I don't pay it off, the 1st option saves me more money in the long run. 

Not sure what to do. Anyone have any idea?

personalfinance,Refinance Opportunity - Appreciate any advice,"Hi all. I currently have a 30 yr FHA mortgage that began in 2018 at $160,000. As of now, the balance is $154,217. My current lender is offering a refinance into an FHA Streamline which would lower my interest rate from 5.625% to 3.875%. My payments are $1394/mo and would drop to $1277/mo, saving about $117 a month. 

What worries me is starting over into 30 years, after I've paid down approx 20 payments, and am approaching Year 2 of my original 30 year term. Additionally, the balance of the new loan is $166,099.00, and I'm awaiting an answer back on why from the lender. I'm not sure if the lower interest rate is worth the additional $6000 on top of starting over 30 years. I bring only a months payment to close, and since I'm being given a lender credit it amounts to $240 to commit to the new term. 

I know that is cheap closing, and I've read that if the interest savings (say I save $50-60k with reduced rate) are more than the cost to refinance, it's a good deal. But the $117 savings from my old payment to new doesn't FEEL worth a refinance to me, as my primary objective is to pay off the house well before 30 years, and I am willing and already commit $150 additional to my mortgage each month, which right off the bat is more than my potential $117 savings. 

This is my first home, and I want to be smart. The lender called me, and the agent seemed to be sort of selling me the idea, which always gives me that ""be weary"" gut feeling. I understand the 1.8% interest deduction is significant, but is it worth resetting my amortization to 30 years after paying over a year and a half and primarily concerned with getting out of debt ASAP?

ANY advice is GREATLY appreciated. Also to note, PMI is included with FHA and does not drop off from everyone I've spoken to. It will remain on the original loan, and on a refinanced if I chose to go that route.

gaming,A message from a disgruntled wrestling fan (Rant),"Wrestling is something that I gained an interest in proximity to some of my closest friends I've ever had.  Even though the majority of those friends have grown apart at this point, I still hold fond memories of watching PPVs (This was well before WWE Network) as well as mimicking wrestling moves on each other on the trampoline.  
Since many of us also had the common interest of videogames; naturally, we spent a lot of time playing the wrestling video games, which also bring up fond memories.
I personally maintained an interest in wrestling until 2011 or 2012, so the last game I played was WWE Smackdown vs Raw from whichever of those years.  After that I took time away from wrestling as a whole.  It wasn't until WrestleMania in 2017 that I got back into it as a viewer.  Then the next game I played was WWE 2K19. Not Impressed, I thought that there was nowhere to go but up.
Fast forward to the announcement of 2K20, it came out yesterday, my birthday, yet, I didn't get it.  Beyond that, I didn't pre-order it, nor do I intend on buying it.  
For those uninformed on the situation.  Between this year's and last year's iterations the game's development went from being co-developed by Visual Concepts, the studio responsible for the NBA Games, and Yuke's a Japanese developer who has been involved in these games since WWF Smackdown! (2001) and has been making wrestling games for even longer; to where we are with 2K20 with Visual Concepts having full developmental control.
As if this wasn't a big enough deal already, turns out VC had to ""REBUILD"" entire parts of the game's engine.  I am only assuming this part, but Yuke's likely had ownership rights with certain builds within said engine, and took them with them when they departed from the team.  This is why you can see such dramatic downgrades in things like hair physics, the targeting system for multi-person matches, and referees' ability to count a pinfall.
This game is not complete, this game is broken, and it is seriously sad to see these games fall from grace like they have basically over the course of my lifetime thus far.

In closing, game studios, this is for all of you, especially in the case of annual release franchises.  The effect you have on fan's of your games is not something to be scoffed at but be careful to not think you have more power over them than you do.  Yes, we can forgive small bugs, but at a certain point it becomes insulting.  I think that point is well before I can watch Becky Lynch put her title on her shoulder only for it to teleport to the inside of her ass.  I ask studios to trust me when I say this..  If your game isn't ready, tell your fans.  This game is being sold for 60 dollars, and it's not only broken, but incomplete.  The absence of Create-A-Championship (To be added in a patch ""hopefully by the new year"" and SPECIAL REFEREE MATCHES is unacceptable at this point in the industry.  So, tell your fans it isn't ready, delay the release if needed.  Then hold that ground regardless of fan backlash.  Yes they may be outraged at exuberant delays, but not nearly as outraged as they have become in this dumpster-fire of a PR corner that you have now backed yourselves into.  I hope Visual Concepts can get their shit together, and that they can before it is too late.

But on a happier note, Yuke's is still in production on some type of professional wrestling game, so that's good, I'm personally hoping for a brand-spanking new NJPW game! Thanks for reading to the end, you are awesome and beautiful!✌️",technology

Is there anything preventing college students with parent assistance/scholarships for tuition (and therefore no need to take out loans) from taking out student loans and using them for investing?

Check out https://K.im  powered by #bitcoin, #Kimcoin (Built on @Blockstream's #liquid) and #Ligtning $BTC.

He seemed quite educated about crypto vs. pseudo-crypto, about corruption, sabotage tactics coming from high places, that BTC can't scale, prohibitively high fees, why BCH happened and why it does make sense.

Now, he does the complete opposite to what he apparently understood before, just makes me wonder, has he struck a deal with the feds or what happened here? That, or somebody manipulating him? Or maybe just pure old greed won out in the end? This direction doesn't make sense otherwise.



He is also selling his ""Kimcoin Liquid tokens"" on Bitfinex, I mean, really?

**The sudden love for saboteur Blockstream, crippled BTC, unfinished (and unfinishable) Lightning, corrupt Bitfinex and ... Tone Vays, it just seems too bizarre**

&gt; While looking for a scalable solution, we even explored adjusting our product to launch on Bitcoin Cash because it seemed there were clear upsides. The bitcoin cash community seemed interested to invest a very large sum and even adjust their technical roadmap to accommodate our product needs. But we also realized that this wasn’t the way forward.

He mentions all the clear upsides and then closes with ""realized that this wasn’t the way forward"", what? Why? What are the reasons? Does anyone know? Can we find out? Maybe Roger, Amoury etc. would know?

Because this seems like he can't come up with any reasons not to use BCH, it's just mentioned for good measure and given some silly excuse.

Bitcoin,People will follow like sheeps forever....,"**Now hear me out....**

There is something strange going on today.

The collapse of the financial system as we know it is closer than ever now. And all fiat currencies will go down with it.

But what happens next? Will gold&amp;silver step up? Will there be a digital dollar backed by nothing of backed by something? Will Bitcoin become the one world currency? 

Do people really think that the ones that have the power and control over the world will just simply give it up because they ""CAN'T"" stop it? 

Do people really think that bitcoin can't be stopped? 

Are you telling me that there is not ONE way to stop bitcoin?

But the most important question here is;

**Does Anyone REALLY want to stop BITCOIN?**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Satoshi** 

There came the first block in 2009 still holding 1 million bitcoins.  Invented by the good Satoshi. And nobody knows who this person/group is. So much power in the hands of this unknown entity. 

But who cares at this moment......

A new decentrelized money. No more power for the governments, central banks, bankers bla bla bla. 

People have  control over there own money. Buy whatever you want send money to who or where ever you want.

No more money printing, inflating the fiat supply, value loss of money and all those kind of bullshit that bitcoin will prevent.

But I really wonder a lot...Who has the keys to block 0? 

It is so hard to believe that a person was sick of the financial system that we run and invented bitcoin to rage against it.

Invented a money to save humanity from the monsters that run the financial system.

Really?

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Bitcoin &amp; Crypto in mainstream media**

Now bitcoin today does not have many fans. 

The governments are against it. 

The bankers are against it.

The president of the USA doesn't like it. 

And so on.....

This publicly bashing of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general reminds me of a book I read called

***The creature from jeckyl Island***. 

It was about the  establishment of the FED in 1913 to move the power over money away from the bankers. And this idea like today was bashed by politicians and bankers. 

FED: \*Gets established by bankers&amp;politicians\*

Same Politicians &amp; Bankers: This ""FED""is not good for our economy

Sheep People: These thieves ""Politicians &amp; Bankers"" are against this system so this must be something good

Politicians: The people want this system and we serve the people

Fed: \*Gets the power over money and the dollar gets rekt\*

Sheep People: ...........

Does this remind you of something???

Maybe all the bullshit that we are getting served in the media?

I really believe that we are being played. That we are being pushed towards digital money (bitcoin). That this has been the plan all along.

Money that can be monitored and traced. Eventually everyone will see who is sending money and who is receiving money. 

No more cash and no more under the table payments. No more illegal activities and no more money laundering.

It seems that the ones that have the power over money now will be even more powerfull after this money transfer.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Future?**

I own bitcoins. I am not a bear or a FUD spreader.

I firmly believe that one day bitcoin will be the world (reserve) currency.

And so I HODL my bitcoins till we can buy EVERYTHING with bitcoins and NOTHING with fiat currencies.

Because I believe that this will be the case someday. And I believe that this will happen faster than we think. 

I just want to know....

Is there anyone else who feels the same way here??? 

Am i the only one that has these feelings about Bitcoin.

Are we really fighting the system with bitcoin or are we just pawns in the next game?

Bitcoin,What's Really At Stake,"At times I believe people forget that bitcoin is a political protest. I am afraid that over the course of mainstream adoption we have undereestimated how dangerous governments could and would be and what their motives would ultimately be to 'tame' bitcoin. And this control they have comes almost exclusively from their ability to attack custodianship. The point of bitcoin was to politically prohibit this elitist behavior by removing custodianship, yet 10 years later, we are all reliant upon centralized exchanges.

&amp;#x200B;

This has to stop. And the main manner in which it will, is when we have decentralized liquidity. Decentralized liquidity is the determining factor, and in order to do that we need for people to be able to host their liquidity the same way they host a seed for torrenting, in almost the same exact manner. We need to completely remove centralized servers and centralized processsing from the equation, virtually everything needs to be run bittorrent style, but especially liquidity. 

&amp;#x200B;

The average person should be able to host liquidity for a small rebate, and this in turn will create a giant web of millions of people with a net effect of far more liquditity than any centralized server can provide, than any centralized custodian. Without this type of extreme decentralized self custodianship, we will continue to be subjugated by tyrannical governments who want to usurp democracy, as people like Snowden have outlined so clearly, and often while claiming they are preserving it underneath some guise such as the Patriot Act, when the entire time they were doing the opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

The US has been guarding oil and opium for 18 years in the middle east, while bankers use the petrol dollar to enslave the globe to their neoliberal monetary policy, a form of debt enslavement, and they always use any excuse they can to call you a criminal for demanding your democracy and constitution actually be respected.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Higher mortgage down payment vs investing.,"I am 30 years old and I have been living with my parents all my life. I work in IT and make around 25K€ a year after taxes. Since I haven't payed any rent for the last 12 years of working I've managed to save up around 110K€. I have car payments of 200€ per month with an interest rate of 3.99% (1670€ left to pay on loan) and a student debt total of 600€ with an interest rate of 5%.

The banks have offered me a maximum of 150-160k€ mortgage loan on an 2,39%+EURIBOR interest rate with a down payment of 10-20% varying on the condition of the apartment (new vs old vs renovated etc). It has proven rather difficult to find an 2 bedroom apartment in that price range. (Downtown Riga, Latvia)

So I was wondering if it would be worth it to increase the down payment to 35% so I could look for apartments in 200K range? Or should I get rid of my low interest rate debt and find a job that pays more so I could minimize the down payment and invest the cash I have saved?

personalfinance,Severe federal under-withholding. How can I avoid/minimize the penalties?,"TL;DR: I significantly under-withheld federal taxes from my employment income. Can I pre-pay my taxes some other way to reduce the penalties?

Long story short, in 2019, life happened and I wasn't able to remain on top of our (me+spouse) finances. Fortunately we were able to ride the storm without major financial issues or further medical complications.

Now that I got a breather and had a chance to review our finances for the year, I found out that we under-withheld federal tax by a large amount. Even if we start withholding 100% of our paychecks until the end of the year, we will be several thousands of dollars away from the safe harbours. Our only significant source of taxable income is employment, I was supposed to review the W4 earlier in the year but I dropped the ball with everything that was going on at the time.

So my question is, how can I mitigate or avoid the penalties? We already increased withholding to 100%. Can I make some kind of pre-payments?

Edits/Updates:
* While ""life was happening"", our expenses actually went down. Combined with having a lower portion of our paychecks withheld, we do have enough surplus to pay what it takes to get to the safe harbour (100% of last year tax liability) without even breaking into our savings. We just started withholding 100% of our W2. I'll look into how to make 1040-ES payments to cover the remaining portion. Would it help to overpay above the last year's liability?",finance

computers,Need help setting up (partitioning?) my HDD,"Hello, this is going to be a long post so please bare with me. I need help setting up my HDD so that it functions correctly, because somehow I've done it completely wrong. Also, I apologize for any formatting issues I am on mobile.

So for some backstory, I've always gamed on PCs growing up, but usually on complete toasters. Earlier this year (April) I finally built my own gaming PC. The PC itself works flawlessly and does everything I want it to, except for my HDD. 

I have a Samsung 860 EVO 500g SSD and a Seagate barracuda 2TB HDD. When building my PC at the start, my goal was to have only my OS and a couple select games to be on my SSD with everything else to be put on the HDD. 

So when I assembled the PC completely, I had seen a guide on youtube (I can't remember it off the top of my head, but can look for it later) on how to install the OS onto my SSD, and said guide told me to unplug my HDD, so that the only functioning drive was the SSD. I proceed to unplug the SATA cable from the HDD from the Mobo. The install goes swimmingly and everything appears to be in order, so I re-plug in the SATA from the HDD back into the Mobo. 

Out of my giddyness to get gaming, I never actually checked if my HDD was in order and functioning and just began installing games. It wasn't until 2 weeks later that I realized everything has been installed onto my SSD and I was running out of space. My PC somehow doesn't recognize my HDD at all, because it doesn't show up in my PC settings under storage, only the SSD.  

So this is where I really screwed the pooch. I did some ""winging-it"" with very minimal, actual research. I somehow turned my HDD into just a storage device instead of an actual, functioning disk drive. I only knew this, because after I did my tinkering I moved all the game files from World of Warcraft onto the HDD, and so when I went to launch WoW, it did nothing, nothing happened. So when I moved the all the game files back to my SSD, it worked fine, completely normal. 

So here I am, months later and completely fed up with having to uninstall games to make room for other/newer games on my SSD. How do I set up my HDD to work like it should?",technology
personalfinance,"Paid 10k in federal income taxes in 2018, got 9k refund. Is that... normal?","I know it's not tax season, but I'm trying to adjust my withholdings  due to my huge refunds each year and am just trying to double check things. In 2018 I made just over 70k on a single income. My wife stays at home with our 2 young children, and we have no second income. We live in a small house, have a decent \~50k in savings, have about 100K in a 401k and earned some interest on that. Nothing really out of the ordinary. We used the standard deduction in 2018.

Forever, I've always had my W4 set to filing as single with 0 exemptions, which is why my refund is so big. Over the last few weeks, I adjusted it to Married with 5 exemptions (the federal tax calculator recommended like 15, but I didn't want to get too aggressive).  This change cut my federal withholding in my paycheck by more than half (from about $350/paycheck to $130/paycheck).  The calculator told me I should still get a small refund of $500 or more even with 15 exemptions, so I should definitely be getting a refund still with only 5.

It just strikes me as odd that after the refund, I only paid something like $1,500 in federal taxes for all of 2018 for my entire family of 4. Is that normal? We are moving into a much larger house soon with bigger mortgage and way higher property taxes, so I'm freaking out a bit because I don't want my taxes to bite me (this house will already be tight until my wife starts to work again).  We'll still likely take the standard deductions each year, and for the next couple of years I will continue to be the sole income for the family.

personalfinance,Should I sell vested RSU’s to pay off student loans?,"Hi,

I have been working full time for a few years now, and have about $16,000 in student loans at the moment. I have been making regular monthly payments ($440 a month, including interest, which is $64 a month), with an interest rate of about 4.5%.

From my previous job, I have about $14,000 in RSUs (after tax), that are sitting around. The price for that company (Salesforce), hasn’t changed much in the last year or so.

I’m wondering: should I use the RSUs to pay off my student loan?
My fear is that the stock price will rise, and I could lose out of a few thousand dollars (it’s about $30 below it’s all time high, which, if it rebounded, would raise my total RSU price by about $2,000). Or is it better to just pay it off now, and invest the $440 a month id be saving instead?

Some points you may have questions about:
- Yes, I do have savings. I am looking to buy a house in the near future, and would like to keep that untouched for now. 
- I do have investment experience, and tend to put most of my holdings in ETA funds, S&amp;P 500, older Fortune 500 companies with healthy financials and dividends, and a handful of tech companies I personally favor and have confidence in.",finance

Throughout the year I pick up other little gigs working for other people I know doing manual labor work. Usually pay very reasonably and in cash. Honestly I get a little depressed when I'm not filling my time with work, so I figure, I might as well be happy and have money.

So all in all, I put away basically a little over $1000 per month in income.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of all my liquid cash, I have it in various savings/checking accounts.

13K in a CIT savings builder account 2.1% APY

10K in a CD 2.55% APY for 6 months, matures in November.

4K in a local banks savings account, 4% APY (this was a special rate, now only valid through the middle of this November)

3K in Robinhood, Honestly, I have no clue what I'm doing. I've broken even. I do it for fun.

3K in a fidelity IRA, I only own FAMRX. I do plan on transferring another 3K here from my other savings beore the end of the year.

Then my hobby of doing Bank promotional bonus comes in here,

1.5K in a Chase Checking, earned $300 for a direct deposit, can close the account for like 2 more months,

Various other less significant amounts in many other accounts in order to get bonuses. This year I expect about $1.2-1.5K in bank bonuses.

≈ $120 in my Prudential 403B, all invest in a Vanguard 500 Admiral fund.

I have about $150 in visa gift card I keep forgetting to spend.

My schooling is all paid for, scholarships have covered about 80% of it, the rest my family has generously agreed to pay for as long as I put effort in.

In terms of my spending, its basically minimal, pretty much 100-200 of my own personal stuff a month from going out with buddies. When ever we go out I pay the bills using my credit cards and get the cashback because my friends do not have credit cards. They then reimburse me with cash. Also I have not been in a relationship so, unlike many people my age, I'm not hemorrhaging money on dates and what not.

I guess my goals are very general basically I want ""fuck you money"". I feel like I really not old enough to really have a grasp on a specific number, except as much as possible. For some reason 100K sounds like a really nice number. I would probably get a finance boner if I ever opened a savings account to see that lol. An aspiration I have is to one day to buy rental properties. My home life is very stable, my family and I get along fantastically. I would like to peruse a career with the federal government as an agent, in literally any capacity. After that I would like to hopefully go through the gov/corporate revolving door and get a nice job at a defense firm or somewhere. I may even consider joining the armed forces after college if I do not get any positions I am happy with to get a security clearance.

personalfinance,Car Rental in FL Charging me 5x the Original Cost for Late Fee; Wasn't Late...,"tl;dr Rented a car from Avis for a long weekend, a week later was charged 5x the agreed amount for a 10 day rental, Avis support won't help and the CC dispute didn't take. How can I get Avis to acknowledge their mistake?

tl;sr Back in August I rented a car from Avis out of MCO, signed the form for $121, and when I was done I dropped off at the same location before noon. Full tank, no damage, right on time and left the keys on the dash (this is what they instructed me to do) - even confirmed with the desk that nothing else was needed. Bada bing bada boom.

The following week I get a bill for $634! The bill claims I dropped it off 6 days later, missing fuel, tons of charges etc.

So I emailed support, called support (they tell me to email again)....call again....long story short all emails I send are ignored, all calls are a loop of uninterested reps who always eventually tell me to email proof and the bill. I dispute with the bank and in the meantime pay the $121 I agreed for the rental.

At this point, I think it's crazy Avis can instruct a customer that all they need to do is drop off the car in the lot, then fine the customer for not proving they did just that. But I agreed to email Avis what I have...essentially a plane ticket I departed on that day from MCO two hours after drop off, a charge from the gas station that day, a GPS tracking screenshot of my departing time, and the bill with the false charge. All emails; mercilessly ignored.

Credit company comes back a month later and says I still owe the remaining $513 because Avis provided the following proof: The bill. How could a bank possibly think a copy of the bill I'm fighting is proof that I owe the bill I'm fighting? Baffled, I send the CC company a stuffed envelope of the same items I sent to Avis. Another month later (leading to today), I can see they charged me the $513 again on my account, and I know I can expect the same 'proof' in the mail soon...

Am I wrong here? I feel that I did everything by their rules and am still being penalized for it. Avis can claim whatever they want without proof, and I just have to suck it up because I wasn't recording on a GoPro helmet the whole time. Even if I was I'm convinced they'd ignore me until I got too tired of arguing. Either way I have no idea how to fight a company that won't listen to me, and it's a lot of money for me to toss away because Avis' dishonesty in their billing - so I turn to you, Redditors or Reddit. Any advice?

UPDATE: Problem was solved. I found that a few other people had success emailing executives at Avis and I found a few of their email addresses. I got a response from Larry De Shon's office pretty quickly apologizing with a refund and a $50 credit after I explained the 'lapse' or customer service across all fronts. Happy it got settled, but still completely unnecessary for a standard car rental.",finance
personalfinance,PMI or 0 Student debt?,"Should home sale proceeds go towards zeroing student debt or 20% down payment?

Basic background, wife and I make around $180-200K combined.  Currently student debt of $74K, mortgage debt $130K.  We are looking to upgrade to a bigger better home, our bank said our ceiling is around $800K, we are aiming for $500K or less.  Current home has a realize value of minimum $260K.  Leaving us with roughly $115K in profit upon home sale.

My question here is are we better off holding our loans at 5.25% interest for 5 years and pulling back on our lifestyle or, payoff the full student loans, put minimum down at 3.5% with $105/mo PMI?

The current mortgage + loans is about = to our new loan if we pay off the loans. If we don’t our mortgage is about $1,500/Mo more than we pay now.

I feel like this is a no brainer and lean towards the lower mortgage interest rate with PMI knowing we can always pay extra over the first few years to get out of PMI.

Either way I’d like to ask what the community view is here?

Additional info we have no other debt besides car leases totaling $700/MO for two car.",finance
personalfinance,How does interest rates on debt and return on investments affect where to put my money?,"I recently got into a discussion about the best way to allocate my money. I currently have a monthly surplus off $500 to $750 a month. I also have $40k in debt. That debt is student loans and a mortgage, with interest rates at 4.5% or less (depending). But, for simplicity's sake, we'll just say 4.5%. At what point do we take an investment opportunity over paying off those loans? How much does inflation affect this decision? Like, if my money has more spending power now, shouldn't I be using that spending power?

On the surface, it sounds pretty simple. Every $500 toward my debt will essentially lock in $1.87 in savings per month (and it capitalizes)! So, any investment that can return me more than $1.87 per month should be taken, right? Lets assume its sure thing. Lets assume I can get a return of 5% on that money. What would I want to take into consideration here?

One point I made was that paying off the debt doesn't actually provide me with any liquidity. If, at any point, I need money, having paid off $6k in loans doesn't mean shit. BUT, if I need $6k that I had invested, that money is at least semi-liquid. Even if the return isn't as good as 4.5%, there is some value in having $$$ you can deploy quickly, right?

Anyway, I thought I had money figured out and now I'm getting all up in my own head. Can anyone tell me how to handle my surplus in a way that benefits me most in the long run?",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

devops,The Complete Overview of DevOps Cloud Native Tools Landscape,"Cloud native technologies are revolutionizing the way applications are delivered. They serve as an excellent complement to [DevOps](https://blog.cherryservers.com/devops-full-picture-an-intersection-of-culture-processes-and-tools) by providing the tools and platforms to enable automation and scalability. However, even for those in the industry, understanding what cloud native is (and isn’t) and navigating the entirety of the cloud native landscape can be a challenge.

Fortunately, the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) is helping to standardize the cloud native space and making cloud native more accessible. Their [Cloud Native Landscape interactive map](https://landscape.cncf.io/) provides us with a list of tools and services that enable cloud native computing. Here, we’ll take that a step further and break down each section of the current cloud native landscape. By the end of this piece, you should have a firm grasp of the different aspects of cloud native computing, as well as an understanding of many of the most popular tools to implement them.

## What is cloud native and how does its

## landscape look like?

One of the more admirable things the CNCF has done is [give the term “cloud native” an authoritative definition](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md). It should help us avoid much of the ambiguity surrounding other terms commonly used in the industry, such as the confusion around [the differences between DevOps and Agile](https://blog.cherryservers.com/how-is-devops-different-from-agile-development-methodology). To paraphrase the CNCF, cloud native tech enables organizations to build and run apps in a scalable and dynamic way. Technologies like containers, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs are important parts of cloud native.

The cloud native landscape is the list of tools, services, and platforms that make up the current cloud native ecosystem. Many popular [DevOps tools](https://blog.cherryservers.com/5-devops-tools-you-should-know-in-2019) can be found in the current list. They are broken up into categories based on the functionality they provide and the layer of the cloud native stack they reside in. As opposed to enumerating every tool in the list, in the sections that follow, we’ll explain each category and review some of the most popular tools available.

## App definition and development

The app definition and development category of the cloud native landscape focuses on components directly involved in enabling application functionality, communication between microservices, application data storage, and image creation.

### Databases

Databases have long been a fundamental aspect of application development. In a traditional LAMP/LEMP stack, the database needs to reliably, securely, and quickly enable [CRUD](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25949/create-retrieve-update-and-delete-crud) operations for the app. Typically, some sort of DBMS (Database Management System) like MySQL, Postgres, or MariaDB was used.

With traditional databases, all the files and resources had to reside on the same host for proper functionality. It’s this requirement that created a challenge for cloud native computing. Databases for cloud native apps cannot have a single point of failure and needs data to be spread across multiple servers. It is something distributed databases do very well.

[Distributed databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database) enable more resilient and modular application development in the cloud. Data is stored by replicating and duplicating it across multiple discrete servers. By doing so, cloud native developers can increase performance and durability of their systems.

Some of the most popular tools in this category are:

* [**Apache Hadoop**](https://hadoop.apache.org/)\- Technically, Hadoop is the framework used for distributed processing while [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) is Apache’s distributed NoSQL database management system.
* [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/)\- You may be familiar with MySQL if you come from a background of spinning up LAMP/LEMP stacks for web applications. [MySQL Cluster CGE](https://www.mysql.com/products/cluster/) is the organization's distributed database offering focused on enabling scalability and high availability (HA).
* [**TiKV**](https://github.com/tikv/tikv)**-** This open-source distributed NoSQL database provides two key benefits: transactional APIs and [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) TiKV is incubated by the CNCF as well.

### Streaming &amp; Messaging

Microservices architecture is the cornerstone of both DevOps and cloud native computing. It allows different services to communicate with each other, maintaining data consistently and avoiding data corruption.

Streaming services and message brokers are the middleware of cloud native. They formalize the way distinct nodes communicate with each other in the microservices-enabled system. [AMQP](http://www.amqp.org/) is one of the most commonly used protocols here, but there are others such as [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) and [STOMP](http://stomp.github.io/).

Each service and protocol works slightly differently, but the underlying principle for messaging is the same: message or event “producers” send information to an intermediary (the broker) that makes delivers it to “consumers” or event receivers to act on the information. There’s a bit of debate on what does and does not constitute streaming, but in a nutshell streaming is simply the ability to do messaging at scale. For a deep dive into the topic of streaming and messaging, check out Roger Rea’s [Streaming Analytics: To Stream or Not to Stream? article](https://www.rtinsights.com/streaming-analytics-to-stream-or-not-to-stream/).

Popular cloud native streaming and messaging applications include:

* [**RabbitMQ**](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)\- A popular open-source message broker that supports a variety of messaging protocols.
* [**Strimzi**](https://strimzi.io/)\- Allows Kafka (Apache’s distributed message streaming platform) to run on a Kubernetes cluster.
* [**Beam**](https://beam.apache.org/)\- A portable and extensible programming model that allows processing batches or streams of data and running them on a variety of execution engines. It supports popular programming languages like Java and Python.

### Application Definition &amp; Image Build

Creating application definitions ([great explanation by Puppet here](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2018.1/creating_application_definitions.html)) and building images are a vital part of automating the development pipeline (which is a key component of DevOps). Reliable images ensure deployment processes can be scaled and reproduced, enabling automation and HA.

Services in this category make it easier to manage containers and clusters at scale. If you think about how containers and microservices work, the use case for these services begins to become clear. Microservices and containerization are all about breaking down large monolithic apps into smaller chunks. It is great for resilience and scalability, but it leaves you with many images that need to be configured, maintained, and ran. Application definition and image building tools make it simple to define multi-container applications. Using Docker Compose, as a specific example, you can spin up multiple Docker containers as a single service.

Here are some of the most popular cloud native tools in the application definition &amp; image build subcategory:

* [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)\- Containerization is one of the most important aspects of cloud native and Docker is the leader in the containerization market. Docker Compose is used to define multi-container Docker apps. Compose uses YAML files for configuration and allows instantiation with one command.
* [**Helm**](https://helm.sh/)**­**\- Kubernetes can get complex at scale. Helm allows you to install, upgrade, and define (using YAML files) Kubernetes apps. While Helm may not be a household name yet, it is maintained by the CNCF and has the support of industry giants like Google and Microsoft. It is also quite popular on GitHub with 13,000+ stars as of this writing.
* [**Packer**](https://www.packer.io/)\- Packer makes it easy to automate the creation of machine images. It also comes with out of the box support for images compatible with a variety of platforms and is extensible. New platforms can be added to Packer by way of plugins.

### Continuous Integration &amp; Delivery

CI/CD is at the heart of DevOps processes. Building quality software quicker is what most DevOps teams that leverage cloud native tools strive for. We’ve covered CI/CD in-depth in our [What is DevOps](https://blog.cherryservers.com/devops-full-picture-an-intersection-of-culture-processes-and-tools) post, so I’ll only give a crash course here.

Continuous integration (CI) is all about making sure developers are working with the latest code build. The code in development cannot drift too far from the main branch, otherwise the hell will break loose. CI helps to ensure bugs, are addressed quickly and keeps the main branch stable, ready to be deployed at any time.

Continuous delivery (CD) is the next logical step after implementing continuous integration. CD automates code delivery pipeline by running different suites of automated tests and deploying your code to QA or staging environments. Some companies go further, by implementing continuous deployment. The only difference is that it automatically deploys your code to production after all the tests have passed.

Here are the most popular CI\\CD tools that are listed in the cloud native landscape:

* [**GitLab**](https://about.gitlab.com/)**-**GitLab is a GitHub alternative that is growing in popularity. The idea here is that you can minimize complexity by baking source code management, CI/CD, application monitoring and security into a single holistic solution.
* [**Jenkins**](https://jenkins.io/)\- The Jenkins automation server application is probably one of the first tools that come to mind when you think about CI\\CD. Trusted by many DevOps teams, as well as being highly extensible and scalable, Jenkins is a popular choice for CI\\CD in the world of cloud native.
* [**Drone**](http://try.drone.io/)**-** Drone is a popular open-source continuous delivery system built on top of Docker. It uses YAML configuration files and is compatible with any environment that can run within a Docker container.

## Orchestration &amp; Management

Cloud native application built in a DevOps-driven organization is inherently scalable, automated and resilient. It means the tools used to orchestrate and manage cloud native apps must be able to work at scale and trigger automated workflows.

In a nutshell, this category of tools is all about making microservices work together in harmony. That’s what the tools in these categories help you do.

### Scheduling &amp; Orchestration

Deploying and managing a cluster of containers is one of the major operational tasks required to create a resilient, loosely coupled, and easily scalable cloud native application. Operating containers in a cluster also helps you enhance operational agility and mitigate the single point of failure problem: you no longer try to avoid failure, but rather prepare your application to handle it with minimal consequences.

If your application consists of just a few containers, tools in this category may be unnecessary. Scheduling and orchestration tools become valuable as cloud native applications scale. The benefit of these tools is that they abstract away the complexities of managing a large number of containers. As opposed to managing your application at the container-level, they provide you with a framework to deploy, rollback, load balance, and configure self-healing functionality at scale. For a more in-depth intro to the topic, check our [Why you need Kubernetes and what can it do](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/#why-you-need-kubernetes-and-what-can-it-do). While that piece is specific to Kubernetes, many of the principles can be generally applied.

There are a variety of options for cloud native container scheduling and orchestration, but the three major players are:

* [**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/)\- Kubernetes or K8s is the most popular container orchestration solution. K8s started at Google and was released as an [open-source tool in 2014](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/2c4b3a562ce34cddc3f8218a2c4d11c7310e6d56)
* [**Docker Swarm**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)\- Docker is the leading container runtime, so it makes sense that their orchestration tool would be a popular and trusted option. Swarms consist of multiple Docker hosts that operate in a cluster as managers or workers.
* [**Mesos**](https://mesos.apache.org/)**-** Mesos is Apache’s orchestration tool that abstracts away infrastructure resources and enables the creation of highly scalable distributed systems. Architecturally, Mesos is an abstraction layer that orchestrates CPU, memory and storage resources of physical or virtual machines.

### Coordination &amp; Service Discovery

There are thousands of stateless microservices in a cloud native application. Their lifecycle is unpredictable since microservices applications are built with auto-scaling and self-healing in mind. Coordination and service discovery tools enable the dynamic configuration and discovery of such microservices that are otherwise hard to handle. Using these tools can reduce redeployments and help with the implementation of stateless services.

The reason these services are useful for cloud native apps is that each discrete microservice may have a different impact on application performance and resource consumption. This requires services that are “aware” of one another. With coordination in place, failover, load balancing, and performance issues can also be addressed. For a practical example of the need for coordination and service discovery, check out [the work Andy Redko did with Apache Zookeeper](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/11/coordination-and-service-discovery-with-apache-zookeeper.html).

Some of the most popular coordination &amp; service discovery tools are:

* [**ZooKeeper**](https://zookeeper.apache.org/)**-** ZooKeeper is a tool from Apache. It is meant to maintain centralized configuration, naming, and grouping of your services. As a distributed system management tool, it is easily scalable and provides redundancy to your system.
* [**Eureka**](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka)\- Netflix is a big contributor to the world of DevOps tools and cloud native computing. Eureka is an open-source service registry they developed to handle large-scale load balancing and failover.
* [**etcd**](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd)**-** etcd is an open-source key-value store that aims to provide cloud native services with configuration and services information in a simple, secure, fast, and reliable fashion.

### Remote Procedure Call

Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) allow applications to call a procedure that is not in the same address space. It is a core part of cloud native computing because it allows discrete microservices to communicate without residing on the same system.

RPCs are by no means new. Sun RPC a.k.a Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC) was originally developed in the 1980s. Similarly, Windows Systems having been using RPC for years. The reason RPCs are so attractive in cloud native world is that they enable language independent and low latency client/server communication. For more on the benefits of RPC, and gRPC in particular, check out The New Stack’s [Google’s gRPC: A Lean and Mean Communication Protocol for Microservices](https://thenewstack.io/grpc-lean-mean-communication-protocol-microservices/).

Popular RPC tools include:

* [**gRPC**](https://grpc.io/)**-** gPRC is an RPC framework designed to run in almost any environment. It is one of the most popular development tools for communication between microservices. gPRC is used by major organizations like Netflix, Cisco, and Square.
* [**Dubbo**](https://dubbo.apache.org/en-us/)\- This Apache offering is a high-performance Java RPC framework. In addition to RPC functionality, it offers intelligent load balancing, an extensible plugin design, automatic service registration, and runtime traffic routing.
* [**Tars**](https://github.com/tarsCloud)\- This RPC framework is based on the name service and the Tars protocol. Today, it supports the Go, C++, NodeJs, PHP, and Java programming languages.

### Service proxy

If you’ve ever had to troubleshoot an application, you’re likely familiar with the difficulty of drilling down to the core of the issue. Is it the app? Is it the network? Such approach may even lead to fingerpointing and make solving problems take longer. One of the core benefits of using a service proxy is being able to decouple network and application problems easily.

Drilling down a bit further, service proxies handle communication between instances in service mesh topologies. Not only do service proxy facilitates network communication, but it also improves observability and facilitates performance tweaks.

Some of the most popular cloud native service proxies are:

* [**Envoy**](https://www.envoyproxy.io/)\- Envoy was created by the Lyft team to serve as a distributed proxy, communication bus, and data plane. The project took inspiration from popular open-source projects like NGINX and HAproxy. It is now used by many respected names in the world of cloud native including SalesForce, Pinterest, AirBnb, and Uber. (were you a little surprised to see Uber using Lyft technology? Score one for the benefits of open source!).
* [**Skipper**](https://opensource.zalando.com/skipper/)**-** Open-source HTTP router and reverse proxy Skipper is designed to handle large amounts of HTTP routes dynamically. It can also serve as a Kubernetes Ingress controller.
* [**NGINX**](https://www.nginx.com/)**-** Much more than just a web server, NGINX provides robust proxy functionality and load balancing. It can also serve as an API gateway…

### API gateway

APIs are an important part of enabling the scalability of cloud native apps. API gateways make API implementation easier by providing a single point of entry for API calls. It makes load balancing, security, and monitoring more effective and simple to manage.

Tyk does a good job of enumerating the benefits of API gateways to microservices in [this piece](https://tyk.io/blog/microservices-api-gateway/). The short version is that API gateways streamline interservice communication, minimize attack surface, and enable service mocking to make testing easier.

There is a bit of an overlap between this and service proxy categories. Apart from NGINX and Envoy, two of the popular API gateways for cloud native apps are:

* [**Kong**](https://konghq.com/)**-** Bosting latencies of less than a millisecond in a world where speed is of the utmost importance, Kong is a very popular API gateway for connecting microservices.
* [**Tyk**](https://tyk.io/)\- Trusted by giants like CapitalOne, Cisco, and Starbucks, Tyk is a popular API Gateway that boasts impressive performance stats. According to their site, on a simple virtual machine with 2 CPU cores and 2 GB of RAM, their API gateway can handle approximately 2,000 requests per second while keeping latency under 85 milliseconds.

### Service Mesh

As cloud native services scale and the architecture becomes complex, a service mesh can help you handle network-based communication of your system more easily. This [Red Hat article](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/microservices/what-is-a-service-mesh) provides a good crash course on the topic, but in a nutshell: a service mesh is a network of proxies that takes the burden of communication off of microservices. These proxies are often referred to as “sidecars” because they are effectively attached to, but still discrete from, the microservices themselves.

Some of the most popular service mesh tools are:

* [**Zuul**](https://github.com/Netflix/zuul)\- Another Netflix contribution to the cloud native ecosystem, Zuul is a gateway that provides functionality including monitoring, dynamic routing, and security.
* [**Istio**](https://istio.io/)\- One of the most popular service mesh projects on GitHub, Istio enables secure communication between services and provides the ability to apply policies to traffic. It also includes robust tracing and logging capabilities for all services.

## Runtime

Even in the cloud, there’s always someone else’s computer behind the scenes. That means hardware resources like storage, compute, and networking must be somehow provided to the cloud native application. The basics are still the same, but in a cloud native world, you need to abstract away from the underlying hardware. Manual processes and tools that are tied to a given server or physical location become impractical with cloud native.

These tools and platforms are geared towards the distributed, hyper-scale, high-performance demands of cloud native.

### Cloud native storage                

There are several big players in the cloud native storage space, including Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store), Azure Disk Storage, and Dell EMC. However, we’d like to focus on open source solutions, since those are preferable in many cases and CNCF (rightfully) tends to have a cloud native bias.  


Cloud native architecture places unique demands on the storage of data. Solutions must be scalable, resilient, and distributed. The ability to dynamically scale and automatically recover storage is a must at scale. Similarly, cloud native storage solutions should avoid platform lock-in and enable storage across multiple cloud service providers.

 Here are a few of the top open-source cloud native storage options:

* [**Rook**](https://rook.io/)\- Rook is a storage solution for K8s. It adds a layer of resilience, automation, and scalability to cloud native storage by focusing on self-healing, self-scaling, and self-management.
* [**OpenEBS**](https://www.openebs.io/)**-** OpenEBS is one of the biggest CAS (Container Attached Storage) solutions available. It is K8s native and runs completely in userspace. Two of the biggest benefits of OpenEBS are avoiding cloud platform lock-in and its quick &amp; easy install process.
* [**StorageOS**](https://storageos.com/)\- StorageOS is a platform that delivers persistent storage built to run on any infrastructure. With a clear emphasis on extensibility and usability, StorageOS boasts compatibility with “any orchestration”, “any application”, and “any infrastructure”.

### Container runtime

“Container runtime” is an oft-misunderstood term. Container runtime is software that executes containers and manages container images on a node. As Daniel Walsh put it in [his post on Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/18/1/history-low-level-container-runtimes), container runtime manages container’s lifecycle by utilizing cgroups and namespaces of the kernel. It’s an overloaded term that is often confused with Docker itself.

Given that, you may be expecting this section to be just about [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). After all, it was once a monolith application that, apart from many other things, also managed container runtime. From the first glance, Docker abstracts away kernel resources and builds logically separated containers on top of them. What else do we need? Alena Varkockova did a good job answering this question in her [Medium piece](https://medium.com/@alenkacz/whats-the-difference-between-runc-containerd-docker-3fc8f79d4d6e). In short, as the container market matured, Docker application was separated into distinct microservices that now provide specific functionality (e.g. [containerd](https://blog.docker.com/2016/04/docker-containerd-integration/)).

So, beyond Docker and containerd, here are a few more container runtime projects worth noting:

* [**Firecracker**](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/)**-** Traditionally, the tradeoff between containers and virtual machines has been viewed as one between being lightweight &amp; fast (containers) or logically isolated &amp; theoretically more secure (virtual machines). Firecracker aims to solve that problem by offering workload isolation and the speed of containers in a single solution.
* [**gVisor**](https://gvisor.dev/)**-** gVisor helps layer security into Docker, containerd, and K8s. It helps serve as a lightweight container security tool for cloud native apps.

### Cloud native network

Automation, scalability, and resilience are key aspects of cloud native networking. One of the big potential “gotchas” of cloud native networking is ensuring network resources are released and reallocated when a given container is destroyed. By planning your cloud native network strategy properly you can avoid such problems, and create a robust and scalable service.

Cloud native networking tools enable scalable and automatic allocation of network resources. This, in turn, enables orchestration and management of your network resources at scale.

A few popular cloud native network projects are:

* [**Container Network Interface (CNI)**](https://github.com/containernetworking)\- CNI is a project focused on plugins for network interfaces on Linux containers and the specifications and libraries for writing them.
* [**Flannel**](https://github.com/coreos/flannel/)\- Flannel effectively enables subnet allocation and layer 3 networking for K8s. While this may seem simple, getting layer 3 right at scale can become complex. Flannel helps automate the process.
* [**Cilium**](https://cilium.io/)**-** Think about the myriad of challenges you could run into looking to use a traditional firewall like iptables with microservices. The visibility simply isn’t there. Cilium is an API-aware network security tool for Docker, K8s, and other container frameworks that helps address this issue.

# Provisioning

Manual infrastructure provisioning doesn’t scale well. To effectively scale out your application, the underlying infrastructure must be defined in the configuration files that would reside in a version control system. Having this done enables you to treat your infrastructure as code and automate its provisioning. As a result, you have an auto-scaling cloud native application.

Each of these subcategories dives deep into enabling provisioning of containers and microservices in an automated and scalable fashion.

### Automation &amp; configuration management

Tribal knowledge and configurations details that only a few chosen team members know do not scale. Due to this reason, configuration management is the key DevOps process. By implementing IT operations practices like infrastructure as code, DevOps teams benefit from reproducibility, uniformity, and increased visibility in change management.

Cloud native automation and configuration tools allow configuration management at scale. Reproducible configuration files make it easy to deploy new servers with pre-defined ruleset or modify existing infrastructure at scale. Additionally, infrastructure as code helps to minimize differences between development and production environments, making your code run as expected once in production.

Some of the most popular configuration management tools include:

* [**Ansible**](https://www.ansible.com/)\- Ansible greatly simplifies configuration management and significantly reduces infrastructure complexity. Ansible Playbooks make otherwise challenging administrative tasks easier to roll out at scale.
* [**Puppet**](https://puppet.com/)\- Puppet is a holistic infrastructure automation and delivery tool. It enables automation of server configuration tasks, and [Project Nebula](https://puppet.com/project-nebula) is specifically targeted to cloud native apps.
* [**Terraform**](https://www.terraform.io/)\- Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool, that allows you to create declarative configuration files where you can map services from multiple cloud vendors, and automate multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning.

### Container registry

Container registries are simply repositories for container images.  A centralized and authoritative repository of container images helps build cloud native applications more rapidly. It allows you to quickly pull a known “good” image and use it as a building block in your application development. For many, a public registry like [Docker Hub ](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-hub)is sufficient. However, there are times where a more robust solution is required.

Companies use the container registry if they want to have more granular control over where the images are hosted. In simple terms, think of container registries as an on-prem or self-hosted version of Docker Hub.

Two popular container registries include:

* [**Docker Registry**](https://docs.docker.com/registry/)**-** Docker recommends using Docker Registry if you want tight control over where your images are, you want control over your image pipeline, and you want to integrate image storage into in-house workflows.
* [**Dragonfly**](https://d7y.io/en-us/)\- Dragonfly is an open-source file distribution system originally developed by Alibaba. It is built to be used with containers and K8s.

### Security and compliance

“Security is everyone’s responsibility” is a common refrain in the world of IT, and this is particularly true when it comes to cloud native application development. Since cloud native often means “everything” resides in the public cloud, there is plenty of room for error that could prove costly. With the ever-present threat of data breaches and the increasing importance of compliance to regulations like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), maintaining a strong security posture and adhering to regulations is more important than ever.

There are a variety of apps focused on enhancing the security of cloud native apps and making the process of integrating security easier. Here are some of the most useful:

* [**InSpec**](https://www.inspec.io/)**-** InSpec is a compliance solution from Chef. InSpec enables “compliance as code” by transforming security and compliance requirements into tests that can be automated.
* [JetStack Cert-Manager](https://www.jetstack.io/open-source/)\- Certificate management can be complex even for smaller web services. At scale, it can become a real challenge. Cert-Manager is a certificate management controller for K8s that keeps certs up to date and attempts automatic renewal before expiration.
* [**Clair**](https://coreos.com/clair/docs/latest/)\- Vulnerability scanning is a big part of keeping web services secure. It holds true whether they are cloud native or not. Clair is a tool for static vulnerability analysis of Docker and [appc](https://github.com/appc/spec)

### Key management

The principle of [least privilege](https://www.us-cert.gov/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/least-privilege) and [zero trust](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/zero-trust-security-what-is-it/) are popular approaches to security that many infosec professionals tout. A single compromised key can lead to a catastrophic breach. Therefore, it is no wonder securing encryption keys is fundamental to sound information security and identity management. In a cloud native world, identity and access management tools should scale easily.

Here are some popular key and identity management solutions for cloud native projects:

* [**KeyCloak**](https://www.keycloak.org/)\- KeyCloak is an Identity and Access Management tool that allows you to secure apps with minimal code. As opposed to authenticating directly against a given app, users authenticate using KeyCloak. KeyCloak supports Kerberos, social login, user federation, SAML 2.0, and more.
* [**ORY**](https://www.ory.sh/)\- ORY Hydra is an open-source Access Management tool that enables OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. ORY Keto enables the creation of access management policies with granular rules based on specific attributes.

# Observability and Analysis

Feedback loops are vital to continuous improvement. If you are not monitoring and analyzing each aspect of your application, you may miss out on key areas of improvement until they impact users. The right tool can help you detect problems early on and build more robust applications. Think about it this way: if there is a memory leak, how soon would you want to detect it?  

Additionally, DevOps tools allow you to monitor performance and trigger actions based on predefined conditions. It makes your system self-aware, being able to react to sudden changes more rapidly. If any given container is in poor health, proper monitoring can prevent significant performance impacts by quickly detecting and replacing broken containers.

Some of the more popular observability and analysis (or as I like to call it: monitoring) tools for cloud native are:

* [**Nagios**](https://www.nagios.com/)**-**Nagios has long been a major player in the on-prem monitoring world and has now effectively made the shift to cloud native. Nagios allows for centralized logging, alerting, monitoring, and notifications based on the data captured from your containers, K8s, and infrastructure.
* [**Zabbix**](https://www.zabbix.com/)\- Zabbix is a highly extensible open-source monitoring solution. It can monitor cloud services, applications, network resources, servers, and more. With over 300,000 installations, it is now clear that many organizations trust Zabbix, which has successfully rolled over into the world of cloud native and DevOps.

# Closing thoughts

That was our walk through the cloud native landscape as it relates to the cloud native stack. In addition to what we covered here, the CNCF also calls out a variety of [cloud native platforms](https://landscape.cncf.io/category=certified-kubernetes-distribution&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category) to choose from to run your cloud native apps, a list of  [Kubernetes Certified Service Providers](https://landscape.cncf.io/category=kubernetes-certified-service-provider&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category) and [Training Partners](https://landscape.cncf.io/category=kubernetes-training-partner&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category), and [serverless technologies](https://landscape.cncf.io/format=serverless). However, what we covered here is the focal point of cloud native: the cloud native stack. It is worth noting that you won’t necessarily need a tool from each category to deploy cloud native applications effectively, but as your business grows the right technology becomes increasingly important.

personalfinance,Help with my financial plan for 2020,"Hi all long time lurker first time poster.

I have been in a new job as a contractor (55 an hr) for a few months and will be accepting a salaried position for 90k going into 2020 and I want help deciding how to best use my money between different accounts/debts. Currently I am 24 and my hard monthly expenses are about 1700 including my car payment but not including my loan payments or my fun budget.

Debts:

Student Loans:

40,000 at 5.25% - I am currently on a fixed payment plan here paying 1010 a month to pay it off in 4ish more years.

19,000 at an average of 4% (none more than 4.5%) - I have just been paying the minimum on these at about 120 a month.

Auto: 

17,000 at 3.9% - I pay 360 a month on this on a 60 month loan (53 months left I believe). Before you shame me I drive a lot and wanted a new car because I value the comfort and it had all the features I wanted and I can afford it. (But you can't afford it! You have debt! Great thanks reddit got it.)

Retirement Accounts/Savings:

401k - about 3,000 between two accounts currently put in 15% but have only been at this job for a few months and had to wait 3 months to contribute. When I convert to salaried I will get 6% matching and will obviously at least contribute that much.

IRA (previously a 401k that got rolled over) - 4000, currently don't contribute to this at all. 

HSA - about 2000 between 3 accounts (need to consolidate these) but I contribute about 200 a month to this currently.

Savings/Emergency fund: 10,000 by the end of the year. I am saving hard because I only had about 1k before this job.


So, I have a few plans on how to use my money and just wanted some opinions. Keep in mind I do value being debt free as quick as possible but I know with low interest debt it CAN be beneficial to just invest the money. That being said I think that tackling debt may be better JUST IN CASE of a potential recession.

Option 1: Tackle the 19k part of my student loans since I am on an already large fixed payment for the 40k. Then contribute what I can to my 401k (maybe like 15ish%). 

Option 2: Tackle the 40k section of my student loans and contribute less to 401k (just 6% or so) since they are technically the highest interest debt I own. This sounds like a lot but after doing the math I would only have to contribue another 2k a month to these loans to achieve this which is slightly more difficult but possible.

Option 3: pay off my car and then put whatever else I can at my loans and contribute about 15% to my 401k. This is very similar to option 1 but probably the worst because I am not in a hurry to pay off a depreciating asset with the lowest interest rate.

Bonus: for options 1 and 2 I could also split contributions to IRA and 401k and do 6% 401k and some amount to IRA to be more diverse.

Option 4: Pay my fixed rate debt (auto and 40k loans) as normal. Pay some amount more on the 19k and contribute much more to investment accounts. Maybe like 15% to 401k and 10% to IRA. Also kind of a mediocre option but if people REALLY think the average return of 7% would outweigh the interest rates then I would consider it.

For all of these options I am not factoring in emergency fund contributions so I could also continue to contribute to that if I want to but I don't think it is necessary.


What do you all think? Currently I am considering option 1 to be the best because it doesn't lock up my money as much and keeps me somewhat diverse with more retirement contributions. Or I could buckle down and do option 2 and be way less debt free.

Edit: I switched my suggestions because I had them backwards. I personally think option 1 is best.",finance

One of the best ways to make sure the easy gains of the past 10 years haven’t made you complacent is to look back at the Crash of 1929.

Ninety years ago this week, the worst stock-market crash in U.S. history began. Almost everything today’s investors think about that pivotal event is wrong—and anyone who believes it’s irrelevant is wrong about that, too.

Everybody “knows” the market collapsed in 1929 because euphoric speculators bingeing on borrowed money drove stocks to absurd heights. That isn’t true.

Didn’t leading forecasters warn that a crash was coming? Not exactly.

Did anyone predict how long it would last and how bad it would get? Not even close.

Doesn’t the 1929 crash prove that if you hold stocks long enough, you’re bound to come out ahead? Only if you have the patience of a tortoise and the emotions of a stone.

Down, Down, Down

The Crash of 1929 was the worst loss in U.S. stock-market history. Stocks didn’t surpass their pre-crashhighs for a quarter of a century.

On Oct. 23, 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.3%. Then, with losses of 12.8% and 11.7% on Oct. 28 and 29—“Black Monday” and “Black Tuesday”—stocks crumpled as if they’d been felled by strokes of doom. (To get the idea, picture the Dow diving more than 6,100 points next Monday and Tuesday, or by nearly a quarter.)

The Dow peaked at 381.17 on Sept. 3, 1929. It finally hit bedrock at 41.22 on July 8, 1932, down 89.2%. In less than 35 months, a dollar invested in stocks shriveled into barely more than a dime.

What caused the collapse? To be sure, some stocks were expensive. According to Barrie Wigmore’s 1985 book “The Crash and Its Aftermath,” National City Bank of New York peaked at 120 times earnings and 13 times book value, a measure of its net worth. (Those multiples are based on a reconstruction by Mr. Wigmore.) This week, Citigroup —the direct descendant of National City Bank—traded at 9.6 times its last 12 months’ earnings and 0.9 times book value, according to FactSet.

And some investors believed fund managers had magical powers. The Magazine of Wall Street argued on Sept. 21, 1929, that it was “reasonable” to pay 150% to 200% more than a fund’s net asset value “if the past record of management indicates that it can average 20 percent or more.”

But most stocks weren’t that overheated. Many major companies traded at 14 to 19 times earnings around the market’s peak in September 1929. Profits were growing far faster than stock prices. Industrial stocks began 1929 priced at about 15 times earnings; by September, they traded at slightly above 13 times, the economist Irving Fisher pointed out in his 1930 book “The Stock Market Crash—and After.”

The hottest stock of 1929, Radio Corp. of America, peaked at 73 times earnings and more than 16 times book value, according to Mr. Wigmore’s reconstruction. How does that compare to today’s technology darlings? [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. traded earlier this week at 73 times earnings and more than 16 times book value, according to FactSet.

To this day, no one is sure why stocks crashed in 1929. The collapse of a British investment firm? Unlikely. A flood of newly issued stock? Probably not big enough. Speculators on a debt-fueled buying spree? Lending standards on borrowings to buy stock were stricter in 1929 than in earlier years.

The likeliest culprit is tight monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. But why stocks collapsed in late October 1929 when rates had been rising since 1927 nobody can say.

The economic forecaster Roger Babson did predict the crash, but he was more lucky than right.

“Sooner or later a crash is coming which will…cause a decline of from 60 to 80 points in the Dow-Jones,” Mr. Babson said in September 1929, although he had also urged clients to get out of the market in 1926 and predicted crashes in 1927 and 1928.

Mr. Babson turned bullish in late 1930 and, by May 1931, said investors should go all-in on stocks. The Dow went on to lose roughly 70% more.

Mr. Babson wasn’t alone. No one foresaw how long and terrible the bear market would be.

“Stock Market Sanity Returns,” declared a headline in The Wall Street Journal on Oct. 26, 1929: “Hysteria Departs as Financial Leaders Find the Situation Is Sound.” Two days later, the Journal reported, “Stock Market Passes Crisis: Banking Support Restores Order After Heavy Wave of Forced Selling.”

In a newsreel from Oct. 30, 1929, still available online, Mr. Fisher, the nation’s leading economist and a Yale professor, proclaimed: “It now looks as though the bottom of the market had been found.”

The market found the bottom, all right—84% lower and almost three years later.

“I look for an era of ten to twenty-five years of…good increases in sound common stocks,” wrote financial pundit J. George Frederick in his 1930 book on the crash, “Common Stocks and the Average Man.”

“Good increases” ended up taking a lot longer than that. The Dow didn’t surpass its 1929 high until Nov. 23, 1954, a quarter-century later. That doesn’t include reinvested dividends, but most investors surely took their dividends as cash in those days.

Not many investors even stuck around long enough to break even. A 1954 survey by the Federal Reserve found that only 7% of middle-class households said they preferred to invest in stocks over savings bonds, bank accounts or real estate.

No one who lived through the crash of 1929 would agree with the view, advanced in the late 1990s, that stocks become riskless if you hold them long enough.

Investors should always regard the stock market as sailors regard the sea—a means to an end, usually benign, but potentially lethal. Catastrophic losses are rare, but their risk never goes away.

To be a long-term investor in stocks, you have to be prepared to lose more money for longer than seems possible. Anyone who takes that risk lightly is likely to sell out, in the next crash, near the bottom.",finance
personalfinance,Trying to figure out if it's worth it to get rid of PMI,"Recently refinanced at 3.375%, $307k principal on a $330k house.

Even with the PMI, the effective interest rate is 3.732%, which is lower than my other investments are earning right now (let's just say 5.0% avg dividends on my stocks).  Does it make sense to pay down the principal to get rid of the PMI?

The mortgage site estimates $43k needed as of right now to drop PMI.  I could probably pump that much extra into the mortgage within 5 months time (still spreading around the money from selling my old house plus my bonus is due in March)

Or, assuming my index funds can keep earning 5% dividends, should I just direct all extra cash there?

personalfinance,UK advice - best way to invest money for our LO?,"My 7 month old baby was left £4000 in my grandmother’s will and my own father has offered to match that. My husband’s father also wants to give him some money but hasn’t specified how much yet. But roughly I think all together we’ll be looking at around £10,000 to ‘invest’ (?) for our LO.

My dad wishes that we will set up some kind of high interest savings account in our LO’s name that would be ‘locked down’ until he was say 18, at which point he could use it for a new car, uni fees, towards his first property etc. - whatever he wants to do with it basically. He did this for both my brother and I when we were little, but we were born in the 1980s so our savings accounts enjoyed pretty high interest rates and this was a good decision.

However, my husband thinks this won’t be as worthwhile for our LO. Interest rates are at an all time low so if we were to ‘lock in’ to anything now, the interest would struggle to keep up with inflation for the next 18 years, let alone actually make any money. 

We are planning to buy our ‘forever home’ next year, with the intention of selling both of our properties and throwing all our savings at it with the intention of getting the biggest deposit and therefore best LTV ratio we possibly can, in order to make our monthly mortgage as low as possible. Essentially to get the best house we can possibly afford on the lowest monthly mortgage we can get away with. 

So husband thinks we are better off asking my dad/his dad if we can take the money meant for our son and roll it in to the deposit we will eventually put down next year, the idea being that the money we will save each month in lower mortgage repayments will be siphoned off each month in to a savings account - we could probably afford to set aside £100 per month for the next 18 years, which would probably mean that our LO ends up with more money long term than the initial roughly £10,000 he’ll have now.

It’s worth saying here I know so little about money and all this kinda stuff makes my head spin. Is there anyone able to weigh in on this in an ‘explain it like I’m 5’ type way and let me know whether my husband has a point? 

Or if you have any better suggestions about what to do with this money?

I promised to discuss some stuff about macroeconomic approaches to forex, and well, with some delay here I am. Again, here I introduce the very same disclaimer. This is a professional approach, not coming from retail. Take everything with a grain of salt, and exercise proper due diligence with your approach. Sincerely hope you get something out of this post.

**An inconvenient, forex truth**

You've been there, struggling and suffering for a while. You have experienced the pain that the markets can unleash on you. You have left positions on the red for longer than your sanity could possible hold. You have opened positions that moved to the green, but you did not take any profits and you let that position slowly die and possibly causing huge loses. Now here you are , in October 2019, possibly as a breakeven trader, still suffering and trying. You have researched hundreds of indicators, if not thousands. You thought you have all sorted out with your RSI , stochastics and TDI. Yet you have switched between strategies more than you have changed your underpants in your whole life. Spent too many hours looking at the screen, wondering what the hell you are still missing.

And the incovenient truth is that you want the glitz and the glamour, and the caviar, but **you are not willing to eat the shit.** And this is the shit: How are you expecting to make any good money on a field where you dont know virtually anything about it. Nor the substance that you are trading, nor what moves it. How are you actually expecting to beat guys that breath and eat economics?. You know literally nothing about volatility and liquidity, about interbanking flows , about puts and calls, market microestructure and price delivery mechanisms both on OTC markets and CME , what is GDP , how is calculated and why is critical. CPI, NMI, GDP to debt ratios, UST, repo markets, shadow banking, carry diferentials, how and why commodities alter certain currencies. EM vs G10 currencies, pegged vs unpegged. Balances of Payments.... When you hear ""greeks"" you are thinking about the Iliad or Athens. You know nothing about business and credit cycles. Valuation anchors, return to the mean, standard deviations, fair values. I could go on and on and on. **Does this make you uncomfortable?** ***It should.***

You have dozens of the best students that the world can produce, coming out of the London School of Economics, or from IT degrees in Harvard and MIT, all moving into freaking huge financial institutions, building complex system, doing incredible research . Funded to an extreme you can not imagine. Working in partnership with the IMF and Central Banks all aroundthe world. PhD's dedicating their lifes to such complex systems and situations....... and yet here you are, insolent and ignorant piece of s\*\*\*, you that have been trying to make your ""RSI"" or ""stochastic"" work for 2 months, trying to beat this multi billion-trillionaire infrastrucure. **Do you start to realize where the f\*\*\* do you stand? Do you really believe even for a freaking second that you can beat them on their game? Using RSI or Ichimoku? EAT.THIS.SHIT.**

And its not that technicals are not necesary. They are. But believe me, I (and most pro's that I've ever engaged with) spent less than 1/5 of the time actually managing trades and looking at price charts. If I'm not scalping , my day starts with me reading around 12 to 15 research papers coming from the main financial institutions, glued to my Reuters terminal reading more reports, looking at polls, updating my macroeconomic models with the latest data, performing calculations related to options...... only then, with a fundamental trading idea, I will move to evaluate technicals to see if the timing is good.

**I want to learn, how shall I procede?**

You want to build a lasting and enjoyable relationship with the market? **EAT THE SHIT**, and do all that is under your control to actually be able to open The Financial Times and understand what they are talking about. It will take you years, and for the education, hundreds of dollars. But this is how it goes if you want to get real. This is career, not a hobby. This is simply the way to be consistent. **EAT THE SHIT.**

personalfinance,"Purchasing a home, is this too much?","I wanted to run by my home purchase scenario for any advice, am I getting into too much?  Prior to this, we had a home at $250k with payments of $1,450/month.

I entered into a contract to purchase a home for $365k (net seller credits) at 3.625%, a historic home from the 1850's (2,400 sq ft) on a 10-acre lot, gorgeous place.  3 car garage &amp; other amenities.  Mortgage payment will be about $2,050 after escrow.  Closing costs are covered by seller. 

I currently make $92k a year as a federal worker, GS-13.  I will have a $3,100 step raise in August 2020 &amp; 2021.  Additional $3k raises are spaced 2 years apart after that through 2025.  
My net pay after benefits, 5% TSP contribution (employer matches to 5%), and all taxes is $2,533 per paycheck, so $5,066/month.  Family is myself, wife, and an 18 month old.

I will be receiving $33k in proceeds from the sale of my other home.  Putting $19k down on new home, and $9k to payoff credit card with 9% APR.  I should have $5-6k in savings after.

Our fixed monthly bills are:
$157 Student Loan (thru 7/2021, $1,597 balance at 6%)

$420 Vehicle (thru 9/2021, $9,467 balance at 2%)

$352 Student Loan (thru 6/2024, $16,804 balance at 6%)

$100 Cell Phone

$80 Internet

$40 Parking (1 day/week work in office)

$13 Netflix

So $1,934 net to use for electric, propane (heat, water, and stove), fuel, groceries, etc.  I will be asking the owners about the utility bills for the new home this afternoon.  

Vehicles: I pay my vehicle insurance premiums in full.  $640 annual for car &amp; truck, $276 annual for motorcycle.  I have a $700 bill coming up for new tires on the car.  Vehicle maintenance is minimal, I do my own oil changes at $20 each.  We keep our vehicles until its no longer feasible.  I work from home, so truck doesn't get used much.

Credit Cards: My 9% credit card with $9k on it will be paid off.  I have a $13k balance with 1.5% until 7/2020 that I need to work on paying off.  Its being paid at $265/month right now.  

Future expense: I intend to raise my TSP contributions back up to 10% in the next year, either with my raise or sooner.  That is an additional $177/paycheck, or $352/month.  I reduced from 10% to 5% a this summer to help  cover our mortgage and current rental at $1,100/month.",finance

solar,residential solar credit and child tax credit,"This is a bit of a long shot but perhaps someone here can answer. We had a $40,000 residential solar system installed this year and are thus eligible for a $12,000 tax credit. We also have two young children so are eligible for $4,000 (2x $2,000) in child tax credits. Our federal tax liability (before either credit) will be around $12,000. In a normal year (without the solar credit) we would take the $4,000 tax credit and our resulting tax liability would be $8,000.

What is the order in which the two credits are applied? If the solar credit is applied first (case A), our tax liability drops to zero and then the child tax credit is applied. This is the tricky part - only $2,800 of the child tax credit is refundable (meaning even our tax liability were zero we would only get $2,800 back, not the full $4,000). I suspect this is the order they would be applied in because the solar credit is not refundable (although it can be carried over, which wouldn't matter in this case because we'd first apply, and use up, the entire $12,000). If the child tax credit is applied first (case B), we would get the entire $4,000 tax credit and then use $8,000 of the solar credit and carry over the remaining solar tax credit ($4,000) to 2020.

As I said, my suspicion is that case A applies here. Case B would be fine as we'd be getting the full $16,000 eventually ($12,000 this year and $4,000 next year), but with Case A, our tax credit would drop to $14,800 (we lose the $1,200 non-refundable portion of the child tax credit). $1,200 isn't a huge deal but it is essentially free money. If case A applies, we would plan to harvest some capital gains (sell stocks with a long-term capital gain to the extent necessary to create $1,200 in additional federal tax, repurchase the same stocks at the same price, thereby taking a step up in basis and would be subject to less tax later on) to essentially take a free step up in basis.

personalfinance,Should I buy a car from savings or getting a loan?,"Wife and I make around $100k a year total, we have $close to $50k in savings as we should.  My adult son has a 2015 he is looking to sell off.   If I give him blue book value, it might run around 10k.  

My savings rate is around 2.09.  If I get a bank loan it will probably run me at best 4.50 (according to my Credit union's rates which are usually better than most prevailing rates).  Time is of the essence so saving an additional 10k may not be in the cards in the time frame we are looking at.  My motivations are to help my son with the sale, acquiring a newer car and rotating the older car to a younger child and considering the car has been driven little and I trust the seller it's a good investment for a car.

With compound interest what it is, keeping the 10k gives me 1089.00 in interest over 5 years, paying a car loan at that interest rate over 5 years means I pay 1186 in interest.  So my net loss is basically $100, which seems minuscule.  However this of course doesn't take into account a variable savings rate.  It might go up, it might go down.  The auto loan would be fixed.

So should I get a loan and keep my money in case of another emergency, costing me a small amount of cash?  Or should I take the money out of savings and pay in cash and own the car outright?",finance

personalfinance,How can I maximize earnings on a lump sum of money over the next two years?,"Hey all!

I have a lump-sum of money I need accessible over the next two years, so I can't invest it, but I want to maximize earnings on it. When I say accessible, I mean I will be adding funds, but I may also need to withdraw funds occasionally (within the federal limits of withdrawals per month), outside of my normal finances of daily living/received from work.

I'm not sure if this is the appropriate place to ask for advice on my thought process, but I looked through some of the resources and information provided on here, and this is what I've been considering:

The amount is enough to deposit to Chase and receive the $350 bonus offer from opening a checking and savings account; it appears I need to keep these accounts open for 6 months without closing in order to maintain this. The other requirements and service fee avoidance requirements are not an issue for me to maintain. I'm assuming this would be my primary action.

After 6 months, I would close the checking account, keep the savings account with the minimum balance ($300) required to avoid a service fee, and open a high-rate savings account at a federal credit union; I made note of some in the resources on this sub. That way, I can maximize the savings rate.

I know an alternative to the federal credit union would be to ""shop"" for other opening offers, but I don't really see that as an efficient use of my time, and would consider it a win to just get the one opening offer. Additionally, I'd keep the Chase savings as an air gap account. 

Does this make sense as an efficient and effective way to maximize earnings? Is there anything else I should consider? I'm not worried about tax implications as the bonus offer and interest rate won't change much, and as far as I know, my credit score shouldn't be affected (right?), but is there anything I'm forgetting to consider? This kind of money management isn't illegal, is it?

I really appreciate any and all input!",finance

personalfinance,"PDL and FMLA questions- moonlighting, holidays, and bonuses (California, not SanFran)","I thought I would try starting with /r/legaladvice but got nothing there. 

I have to say that trying to figure out PDL and FMLA (paid and unpaid), was complicated enough, and then there is CFRA, NPLA, and they all seem to be overlapping programs. 

My wife and I both work for the same engineering firm. We have tried asking out HR person these questions, but they are nigh useless. Our HR person started at the company over 30 years ago when it was only a 2-person partnership and we've grown to over 25 persons and two offices since that. The boss's business attitude is very much good'ole boy style, or even downright old fashioned. Our company policies haven't been updated since the company was formed over 30 years ago and does not even begin to address anything like FMLA. When we question the boss he answer is simply whatever the State mandates him to do and nothing more, which we then have to explain to him what the State mandates. We've kind of learned to ask for forgiveness than permission with him. 

We are pretty positive she meet's all the Federal / State requirements to qualify for FMLA, PDL, etc in number of employees, hours work, dollars paid into SDI, etc. 

1. My wife is scheduled to start her PDL the Friday before Thanksgiving. SDI will pay partial income as part of PDL starting 4-weeks prior to the due date. It is our company policy that Thanksgiving and the following Friday are paid holidays, as well as Christmas and New Years and 1/2 day for each Eve. Our normal pay period for that time is from the 17th through the end of the month, so some of the days she will work are on that pay period. Is she entitled to receive holiday pay as part of that pay period? If we were to delay the start of her PDL till the Saturday afterwards, would she be entitle to receive holiday pay? Our doctor is telling us new mother's tend to run about a week late from the due date anyways so delaying it a week isn't that bad. 

2. We are paid 2 weeks after the time period we worked. For the work period of Nov 1-16, that check will be issued on Dec 1st, likewise the work period of Nov 17-30 will be issued on Dec 16th. Will receiving these pay checks, at these later dates, during PDL interfere with PDL eligibility? It also means when she finally returns to work, it will be about a month from when she returns till she gets paid again. 

3. Normally we receive performance bonuses on Jan 1st. She has meet all requirements to receive this bonus. Trying to talk the boss into issuing it early will not happen. For years I have been trying to get him to move the bonuses to before Christmas, but he won't budge. Will she be eligible to receive a performance bonus while on PDL / FMLA? Will receiving the bonus affect PDL? Is it unethical for the boss to pay me her bonus even if the sum of our incomes are already on our taxes? While we have no policy about bonuses, just how things have always been done, there was one instance where someone quit in December and the boss did not give them their bonus and I think the boss might try that being such a Scrooge. 

4. The last 6 months my wife has been moonlighting as a gym coach in the evenings. My company does not have any policy regarding moonlighting. Can she continue to moonlight while on PDL or FMLA? Not while on PDL but yes while on FMLA? Not while on paid FMLA but yes on unpaid FMLA?",finance
personalfinance,Great opportunity and no idea how to secure it.,"Hello all! So as the title states, and I will try to be brief on the description, there has been an opportunity presented to myself and my fiance.

Fiance has been offered the ability to purchase points within a corporate environment on a new acquisition. The company she works for is strong and a well known brand. The problem is we do not have the funds.

The buy is upwards of $30,000USD. The financial report depicts that it can easily return double that, payout is yearly starting in 2021. We have no where near this amount of money

I have been looking into a secured loan but we just bought our home about 3 years ago and don't have the equity.

My credit is decent/good (used to be terrible but this place has helped tremendously)  but my debt to income is to high to get this much unsecured. Her credit is terrible (a work in progress thanks again to this sub)

We can't pull from retirement plans without termination of employment due to the rules/regulations. This is one of those opportunities that helps set you for life and brings you out of being a struggling upper-lower class/lower-middle class and guarantees your kids college. Again I can't get into the details but the company she works for isn't going anywhere and only ever does well.

I digress. What options do we have? I have talked to my credit union and they don't look like they can help, spoke to places like lending tree with their insane interest rates the monthly payments wouldn't be feasible on our budget. The whole point of buying in is to show financial responsibility so we can't ask her company. Never mix money and family so that is out. Anyone want to buy a kidney? (JOKING) In all seriousness is there something I am missing that could make this viable.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I get that this is causing some concern in this community. Because my knowledge and understanding of terms and potential legal issues is vague my summary is vague. I can assure you the companies are above board and what is being offered is similar to a NSO/PSO. My lack of understanding is why this sounds ""bad"". My question is more ""I am 90% sure this is not a bad investment, how can I option this?"" Again I apologize for the confusion and truly wish I was more clear on the subject so i could be more clear with the community.

Edit 2: Thank you all for the words, well some of you, and to those that PMed me for more information to help us make a better decision. We found a way to secure the loan on someones advice. I'll let you know how it goes.",finance
personalfinance,New Job! Do I pay down cc debt/student loans then invest in 401K?,"Hi Everyone!

Thank you for taking the time to read this! I am currently setting up my budget, so any advice given is very appreciated! Here is some background regarding my finances:

**Debt**

1. Combined credit card debt of \~$5,800 at 15%
2. $41,000 in federal student loan debt at 5% (currently paying the minimum on a 10-year monthly plan).

**Question**

Since this is my first job, I am leaning towards the avalanche method towards paying all my debt. My gross income is $60,000, and I plan to go back to grad school in the next 1-2 years (hence why I am leaning towards the avalanche method).

My current employer matches my 401K contributions at an $8,000 cap (6%). Therefore, if you were in my shoes, would you lean towards the avalanche method of crushing the debt, or budget to invest for the 401K? I currently live at home, and my monthly expenses are budgeted for $500 a month. I'm in my mid-twenties, if its relevant. Thank you! \[Edited for formatting purposes\]",finance

We've built a community to educate people from any technical background on the importance of privacy, and privacy-friendly alternatives. We evaluate and recommend the best technologies to keep you in control and your online lives private.

We've been busy. Lately, in addition to [a complete site redesign](https://www.privacytools.io), we've begun hosting decentralized, federated services that will ultimately encourage anyone to completely control their data online. We’ve started social media instances with Mastodon and WriteFreely, instant messaging instances with Matrix's open-source Synapse server, and technical projects like a Tor relay and IPFS gateway that will hopefully help with adoption of new, privacy-protecting protocols online.

I wanted to open a mutual fund. In the app, I see my investment referred to as a brokerage account. Is this just semantics or did I fuck that up somehow?

It's been 3 weeks and it still displays my funds in short-term reserves. Are investments made in a cycle or qued? 

My ideal scenario is to put the majority of my savings into this account. Do I do that through the buy option? Can I do it weekly?

personalfinance,Should I refi my Mom's mortgage or move out,"This is going to be lengthy I apologize ahead of time....

Currently I live at home with my mom in NYC. She lives upstairs and I live downstairs. My mom is not in the best of health and she's older, I'm 27. Downstairs is a MESS it needs major renovation however it would be too expensive to do out of pocket. I'm getting to a point where I'm fed up with living like this and I want to either move out or have the renovation done.

I'm leaning toward the renovation and I think the best way to finance the renovation is by refinancing the mortgage in my name. My credit score is pretty good, (750+) I make 90k and I don't have too much debt (&lt; $20k). My mom's credit score is bad, below 600. I'm wondering if the best option would be to refinance the mortgage for more than the current amount and use the difference to do renovation. I would also get my name added to the deed if I were to do this.

I understand I would have to worry about the capital gains tax but honestly in the long run, I see myself living in the house with a family on both floors or rent it out to another family.

I guess what I'm really asking is- what should I do?",finance

personalfinance,Stock Portfolios in relation to Loan Approvals,"Does anyone know the reason why if you have a stock/bond portfolio it's never included in the decision making process by loan underwriters? 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember vividly I had one rejected for student loan refinancing even though I had about 80% of what my loan balance was in my brokerage account. I thought that was kind of amazing considering with the press of a few buttons my loans could almost completely disappear. Then I remember when I purchased a car recently and again had enough in my brokerage to pay it off at least 3x and yet they didn't even care about what I had in assets and instead threw a 7% interest rate at me.. (I have a 750 credit score) so I was kind of surprised by that.. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, point being it always seems like loan underwriters never even give stock/bond holdings a look and I don't get that.

personalfinance,Advice on renting from parents,"I have a situation that I need some advice on, so here's some background numbers of information that I have.

My husband and I currently own a 1 Bed 1 Bath condo that costs about $1500 a month in total (heat, utilities, etc included). We bring in a total of about $175,000 a year, with our only debt being the mortgage, so we have our expenses under control. However, we are considering starting a family and looking for a bigger home eventually. We are ok renting out our current home eventually and my husband has been helping his parents rent properties as well.

My parents currently live in a 3 Bed 2.5 Bath home that costs around $2500 a month. They recently fulfilled a dream of theirs and bought a $1.2 million mansion, which will cost them probably around $6000 a month on mortgage alone (calculated from today's interest rates on a 30 year mortgage). My parents do not plan to sell their current home, but they are also not handy people nor do I think they have the desire or ability to be good landlords. They strongly prefer the arrangement where my husband and I move into their current home, since they trust us as their tenants and obviously we would not expect them to address problems the way most tenants would. My husband is fairly handy and can handle most issues or find the right people to help.

My parents plan to charge us around $3000 a month to live in their current home, because they still need/want some income from their current home to help pay for the dream home. While that is a fair number for their location and size, it's not a number that my husband and I considered when looking for a new home, since it would double our current housing expenses. I don't want to rip my parents off, yet I think their home is a little too pricey for us, even if we can afford it.

I started considering alternative options that might allow both parties to be happy. I've listed a few below with the pros and cons, but I was wondering if there were any benefits or flaws, or even an entire solution that I didn't think of but the Reddit community would. Anyways, here are the scenarios I came up with:

1. We don't move to my parents house and let them find tenants to rent their current home.

PRO: We don't have to pay a higher housing expense than we want.

CON: Parents have to be landlords when they don't want to, and we have to find another future home.

2) We buy my parents current home.

PRO: My parents have plenty of cash from the home sale

CON: We may not be able to afford a loan for this and I think it's a very inefficient use of money since there will be tons of fees and taxes?

3) My parents transfer over the property and mortgage to us.

PRO: Parents don't have to pay 2 mortgages, we don't have to pay any additional rent

CON: My parents may have issues with the dream home financing if they suddenly lose an asset like their current home

4) My parents transfer the mortgage to us, but keep the property in their name. (I read this is possible but not sure?)

PRO: My parents look great in terms of dream home financing since they just dropped a mortgage

CON: I'm paying a mortgage on a home that my parents own.

5) We rent my parents home at their specified rent.

PRO: My parents look good in terms of dream home financing

CON: We will be paying much higher housing expenses to help my parents pay for their dream home.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I'm leaning towards 4. My husband and I have a goal of lower monthly costs, but my parents goals (clearly) are about living a large home. It's always a tricky situation when mixing business with family, and I just want to know that I've explored all my options before choosing something that will probably end up being a big decision in me and my family's life. I'm hoping a mortgage adviser has some trick up their sleeve...or it may just be an incompatible situation. Let me know your thoughts or if any critical information is missing!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: So I may have given the wrong impression - my parents make about $300,000 together, so they should definitely be able to afford their new home. I think they just want some income from their current home, so they look better to the lender? I don't feel like they are trying to take advantage of us, but aren't considering our perspective in their plans. I agree that 4 probably can cause trouble, but does taking over the mortgage and property (option 3) sound like a bad idea?",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan payoff options,"Hey r/personalfinance! Wanted to get your input on something.

&amp;#x200B;

As many people, I have been trying to knock off my student loans.  That's been a top financial priority for me.  Been paying them too many years, and have paid too much interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have a comfortable emergency savings, plus some extra cash, and I have been investing into my retirement accounts (10%), while paying off my student loans.  Now I'm at a point where it is feasible for me to actually end these damn loans once and for all.  Here's what I could do (please, here me out).

&amp;#x200B;

Take current cash in hand (about 80% of my emergency savings, plus extra cash I have), and take out a loan against my retirement to cover the rest.  Obvious first reaction is, ""don't do that to your emergency savings! Don't do that to your retirement!"" I'm early 30's, and have a stable job (as long as something critical doesn't come up).  My current loan interest rate is 5.05% with about $430/month in payments.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're not familiar, with the retirement loan, you pay back at 1.75%, all of which the interest goes right back to your investment account (you're basically paying yourself the equivalent of a government bond, as the account is meant to be an investment).  My payment would be taken right out of my paycheck, at less than what I'm paying my current student loan at (and there's no penalty for paying off early).

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

\-Reduced monthly payment

\-Not paying interest anymore, besides the 1.75% that goes right back to me

\-No more student debt! (Granted, it's shifting money, but at least I'm paying myself back)

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\-Opportunity cost for the amount I take out in the loan, which could be more than the 1.75% I'm paying myself

\-Taking a hit on my emergency account (I can prioritize that over the next couple of months to regain that amount, but there is an inherent risk).

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 28th, 2019","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 28th, 2019.

# **The Fed and Apple earnings will make or break market’s return to record highs in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/25/the-fed-could-be-what-makes-or-breaks-the-stock-markets-push-into-record-territory.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks will try in the week ahead to break the all-time highs set earlier in the year as a slew of S&amp;P 500 companies get set to report.
*****
&gt; Stock prices are bumping up against their highs, but whether they can burst through and hold gains may, for the near term, depend on what investors hear from Jerome Powell in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; In a week stacked with major events, the Fed’s two-day meeting is likely to be the high point. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to make its third quarter point interest rate cut Wednesday afternoon, followed by comments form Fed Chairman Powell. Those comments could be his most important message of the next few months, as investors watch to see whether he holds the door open to future rate cuts, or signals it’s time to pause, as some economists expect.
*****
&gt; “Our view is they’ll be done after this. We’re not expecting a cut in December, and we’re not expecting cuts next year. The economy, in my mind, looks like it’s stabilizing, and there should be more evidence of that in the next couple of weeks. focusing on the labor market is the key thing,” said Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management. If the labor market holds up, expectations for rate cuts should decline. “I do think the dissenters are arguing they shouldn’t be cutting at all.”
*****
&gt; But Matus’ view is just one of many on Wall Street. Some economists expect another cut in December, while others expect one or more cuts next year, depending on how they view the economy. Goldman Sachs economists laid out a case where the Fed will clearly signal that it plans to pause after Wednesday.
*****
&gt; All of this could make for volatility in stocks and bonds, depending on which market view prevails in Powell’s comments. “It’s going to be choppy going into the Fed,” said Andrew Brenner of National Alliance. In the past week, yields were higher with the 10-year Treasury yield touching 1.8% Friday.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.2% for the week, ending at 3,022, just below its closing high. On Friday, it briefly traded above the July 26 high of 3,025. The Dow ended the week with a gain of 0.7%, at 26,956, and it remains about 1% below its closing high.
*****
&gt; In addition, the earnings calendar remains heavy with about 145 S&amp;P 500 companies releasing earnings, including Alphabet Monday and big oil Exxon Mobil and Chevron Friday. On Wednesday, earnings are expected from Apple, which is setting new highs of its own.
*****
&gt; # Big economic reports

&gt; On top of that, November kicks off Friday in what looks to be the most important day for economic data of the new month. Besides the critical monthly employment report, there is the key ISM manufacturing report, expected to show a contraction in manufacturing activity for a third month.
*****
&gt; Both reports could be distorted by the GM strike, which is expected to result in an October employment report with fewer than 100,000 jobs. According to Refinitiv, total non farm payrolls are expected to be 90,000, while manufacturing jobs are expected to decline by 50,000. That would include the impact of GM workers, but also the employees of the many suppliers and services that support the car company’s manufacturing operations.
*****
&gt; “The jobs number will be big, but the ISM could be bigger. If that turns up, like Markit [PMI] suggested, that could be a big deal,” said Leuthold Group Chief Investment Strategist James Paulsen. On Thursday, Markit flash PMI manufacturing data for October was higher than expected, and still has not shown a contraction.
*****
&gt; “If it turns up, I think that’s to affect a lot of people and how they feel about things. That could take on a whole new dimension of what happens to Wall Street earnings estimates,” he said.
*****
&gt; Manufacturing data has dragged, due to the impact of tariffs and the trade war, and some big companies have taken a hit as a result, like Caterpillar which on Wednesday reported weaker than expected earnings and sales. Caterpillar also cut its outlook, in large part due to weakness in China. Caterpillar shares were slammed but on Friday, the stock was bouncing back by 3.5%.
*****
&gt; # Stocks at ‘inflection point’

&gt; Quincy Krosby, Prudential Financial’s chief market strategist, said the fact Caterpillar was able to come back at the end of the week was a positive for the market, which she says is now entering the late year seasonal period where stocks typically do well. At the same time, she said news for the market looks like it’s about to get “less bad.”
*****
&gt; ″″Less bad’ is not a full fledged agreement with China. Less bad is a truce. It means that Dec. 15 extension in tariffs does not happen,” she said, adding the market appears to be at an inflection point with investors expecting an agreement of some type between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping when they meet in November.
*****
&gt; ″‘I’m not bullish. I’m not bearish. I’m optimistic. This market has been led by the defensive sectors. You’re starting to see that move into consumer discretionary. It’s telling you the market is seeing growth, albeit it not stellar growth, but when it gets ‘less bad’ you’re going to see that it’s being reflected in this inflection point in the market,” said said. “We’re seeing a move more and more into the cyclical and growth sectors, and by the way, we’re seeing a steepening of the yield curve.”
*****
&gt; The yield curve represents the difference between the yields of two different duration Treasury securities. When the curve inverts, the yield on the shorter duration security, in this case the 2-year has become higher than that of say, the 10-year. That is one part of the curve that was temporarily inverted, and if it stayed inverted it would be a recession warning.
*****
&gt; The 10-year has been moving higher, and the 1.80% level will be important if the yield can stay above it.
*****
&gt; “If it pushes through 1.80, you’re going to take the inversion out, by the bond market, not the Fed,” Paulsen said. Paulsen said it would be a sign of confidence in the economy if yields can push higher.
*****
&gt; The Fed taking a pause may add to that sense. “I think most people think one more cut and done,” he said. “The bigger news will be what [Powell] says in that press conference. He can go pretty off script sometimes.”
*****
&gt; # ‘Greater optimsim’ in market

&gt; Paulsen said stocks could be in a good period, and earnings news seems to be already priced in. “The data by and large has been okay. You have earnings that are okay, and there’s no sense of imminent recession. It just seems there’s greater optimism,” he said.
*****
&gt; Of the approximately 200 S&amp;P companies that reported by Friday morning, more than 78% have beaten on earnings per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to decline by 2% for the third quarter, based on estimates and results from companies that already reported.
*****
&gt; Paulsen said there’s some sense in the market that Brexit will not end in a worst case scenario, but it is something to watch in the week ahead as British lawmakers decide whether to hold an election.
*****
&gt; Jack Ablin, chief investment officer with Cresset Wealth Advisors, said he thinks Brexit would be a bigger deal than the trade agreement for the world economy, if it goes poorly, with the U.K. leaving the European Union with no deal. “A no deal Brexit is likely to take 2 percentage points off of British growth...It would take 1% off European growth...I think that’s significant,” Ablin said. “I think investors are underplaying it because it’s so binary. It’s hard to position for a binary outcome. If we get some resolution there, to me, that has the biggest impact for the markets.”

# Bullish Halloween Trading Strategy Treat Next Week

&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 25 years. From the tables below:
* Dow up 19 of last 25 years, average gain 2.1%, median gain 1.4%.
* S&amp;P up 21 of last 25 years, average gain 2.1%, median gain 1.5%.
* NASDAQ up 21 of last 25 years, average gain 2.7%, median gain 2.3%.
* Russell 2000 19 of last 25 years, average gain 2.2%, median gain 2.5%.

&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course “Sell in May”. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac that most of the market’s gains are made from October 31 to April 30, while the market goes sideways to down from May through October.

&gt; Since 1950 DJIA is up 7.5% November-April and up only 0.6% May-October. We encouraged folks not to fear Octoberphobia early this month and wait for our MACD Buy Signal which came on October 11. We have been positioning more bullishly since in sector and major U.S. market ETFs and with a new basket of stocks. But the next seven days have been a historically bullish trade.

# Normally a top month, November has been lackluster in Pre-Election Years

&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000’s (since 1979).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef59a01a84a6391160b8624e5d05acf0/795865009b4c2002-94/s400x600/2d11d5ae114446e6162b685da1210ec1c8e83e73.jpg))**

&gt; In pre-election years, November’s performance is noticeably weaker. DJIA has advanced in nine of the last 17 pre-election years since 1950 with an average gain of 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 has been up in 10 of the past 17 pre-election years, also gaining on average a rather paltry 0.3%. Small-caps and techs perform better with Russell 2000 climbing in 6 of the past 10 pre-election years, averaging 1.2%. NASDAQ has been up in 7 of the last 12 pre-election year Novembers with an average 0.9% gain. Contributing to pre-election year November’s weaker performance are nasty declines in 1987, 1991 and 2007.

# Q4 Rally Is Real. Don’t Let 2018 Spook You

&gt; Understandably folks are apprehensive about the perennial fourth quarter rally this year after the debacle that culminated in the Christmas Eve Crumble in 2018. But the history is clear. The fourth quarter is the best quarter of the year going back to 1949, except for NASDAQ where Q1 leads Q4 by 4.5% to 4.0%, since 1971.

&gt; Historically, the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Election Cycle is the three-quarter span from Q4 Midterm Year through Q2 Pre-Election Year, averaging a gain of 19.3% for DJIA and 20.0% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and 29.3% for NASDAQ since 1971. Conversely the weakest two-quarter span is Q2-Q3 of the Midterm Year, averaging a loss of -1.2% for DJIA and -1.5% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and -5.0% for NASDAQ since 1971.

&gt; Market action was impacted by some more powerful forces in 2018 that trumped (no pun intended) seasonality. Q2-Q3 was up 9.8% for DJIA, 10.3% for S&amp;P and 13.9% for NASDAQ. Q4 was horrible, down -11.8% for DJIA, -14.0% for S&amp;P and -17.5% for NASDAQ.Q1-Q2 of pre-election year, especially Q1 gained all that back.

&gt; Pre-Election year Q4 is still one of the best quarters of the 4-Year Cycle, ranked 5th, for average gains of 2.6% for DJIA and 3.2% for S&amp;P since 1949 and 5.4% for NASDAQ. Additionally, from the Pre-Election Seasonal Pattern we updated in last Friday’s post, you can see how the market tends to make a high near yearend in the Pre-Election Year. So, save some new unexpected outside event, Q4 Market Magic is expected to impress once again this year.

# 2019 May Be One of the Best Years Ever

&gt; “Everything is awesome, when you’re living out a dream.” The Lego Movie

&gt; As the S&amp;P 500 Index continues to flirt with new record highs, something under the surface is taking place that is making 2019 extremely special. Or dare we say, “awesome”.

&gt; First, let’s look back at last year. 2018 was the first year since 1969 in which both the S&amp;P 500 (stocks) and the 10-year Treasury bond (bonds) both finished the year with a negative return. Toss in the fact that gold and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil were both down last year, and it was one of the worst years ever for a diversified portfolio.

&gt; “As bad as last year was for investors, 2019 is a mirror image, with stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil all potentially finishing the year up double digits for the first time in history,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, it has been a great year for stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil. Of course, there are still more than two months to go in 2019, but this year is shaping up to be one of the best years ever for these four important assets.

# An Early Look at Earnings

&gt; We're now in the thick of the Q3 earnings reporting period with 130 companies reporting since just the close last night. As shown in our Earnings Explorer snapshot below, earnings will be in overdrive for the next two weeks before dying down in mid-November.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/explorer.png))**

&gt; Through yesterday's close, 248 companies had reported so far this season, and 75% of them had beaten consensus bottom-line EPS estimates. However, just 63% of stocks have beaten sales estimates, and more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance. In terms of stock price reaction to reports this season, so far investors have seen earnings as relatively bullish as the average stock that has reported has gained 0.60% on its earnings reaction day. Below we show another snapshot from our Earnings Explorer featuring the aggregate results of this season's reports and a list of the stocks that have reacted the most positively to earnings. Four stocks so far have gained more than 20% on their earnings reaction days -- PETS, BIIB, APHA, and LLNW.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/epsstats.png))**

&gt; We provide clients with a beat-rate monitor on our Earnings Explorer page as well. Below is a chart showing the rolling 3-month EPS and sales beat rates for US companies over the last 5 years. After a dip in the EPS beat rate earlier in the year, we've seen it steadily increase over the last few months up to its current level of 64.46%. That's more than five percentage points above the historical average of 59.37%.

&gt; In terms of sales, 57.87% of companies have beaten top-line estimates over the last 3 months, which is much closer to the historical average than the bottom-line beat rate.

# Banks - On To The Next Test

&gt; It has been a pretty monumental two weeks for the KBW Bank index. Since the close on 10/8, the index has rallied just under 9% as earnings reports from some of the largest US banks received a warm welcome from Wall Street. The index is now once again testing the top-end of its range, one which it has unsuccessfully tested multiple times in the last year. If you think the repeated tests of 3,000 for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 18 months have been dramatic, the current go around with 103 for the KBW Bank Index has been the sixth such test in the last year! We would also note that prior to last year's fourth quarter downturn, the same level that has been acting as resistance for the KBW Bank index was previously providing support.

&gt; In the case of each prior failed break above 103 for the KBW Bank index, sell-offs of at least 5% (and usually 10%+) followed, but one thing the index has going for it even if the sixth time isn't the charm is that just yesterday it broke above its downtrend that has been in place since early 2018. The group has passed one test at least! From here, if we do see a pullback, that former downtrend line should provide support.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/102319-Banks.png))**

&gt; Turning to the KBW Index's individual components, the table below lists each of the 24 stocks in the index along with how each one has performed since the index's recent low on 10/8 and on a YTD basis (sorted by performance since 10/8). In the slightly more than two weeks since the index's short-term low, every stock in the index is up and up by at least 4%. That's a pretty broad rally!

&gt; Leading the way to the upside, State Street (STT) has rallied nearly 20%, while First Republic (FRC), Northern Trust (NTRS), and Bank of America (BAC) have jumped more than 13%. In the case of STT, the rally of the last two-weeks has also moved the stock into the green on a YTD basis.

I don't make enough to make any real payments and because of the interest rate the amount of money I owe is going up even as I make the minimum payment. (payment is about 50$ and after I make the payment the intrest adds like 100 a month or something.)

At work so I can't get into all the details rn, but basically they didn't teach anything. The teachers ignored us. Then I was told all the loan and grant money I had was drained, (it was supposed to be enough to get me through 2 years) and when I called they just kept cycling me between two lines.

personalfinance,What should I put my bonus towards in order to help my credit score the most?,"Hi all,

I was just told at work if I get a project successfully pushed I will receive a bonus. This bonus is a nice chunk of change and could help me immensely and I wanted some insight on what might be the best option to do with it based off of the outcome I want. I recently graduated in May and my student loans are reaching the end of the grace period. Unfortunately, I have a nice chunk of student loans from a predatory lender. My payment might as well be a mortgage and although I can pay it every month, my goal is to refinance and get a lower interest rate and lower payment. 

The only issue with that is I need to get my credit up, unfortunately I had to buy a new car unexpectedly recently and it hurt the work I had put into my credit score for my student loan refinancing. I am hoping to put this bonus towards some debt I have (whether it’s the student loans, car, or the little bit of credit card I have)  but I was wondering if putting into one or the other would raise my credit score more. This bonus could pay off all my credit card debt and have some left over one of the other two. It could also cover multiple of my smaller loans from the predatory lender, but not pay off my car period. I lean towards the loans or the CCs just because  that would eliminate or lower a monthly payments for debt payments. But my number one priority is getting that higher credit score. Do any routes have a higher chance of raising my score?",finance
personalfinance,Personal loan to payoff car and credit cards?,"I am considering getting a personal loan to payoff $10k in credit card debt on my Discover Card and the remaining 7k of my car loan. I plan to payoff the car and then immediately sell it and use that money to pay off even more debt. I rarely drive (maybe once a week) and don't need the car. I'm doing this because the monthly payments are becoming too much for me and I need to release some of the financial burden. The monthly payment for the Discover is $288 and the monthly payment for the car is $300. If I sold the car I would cancel the insurance saving me another $100 a month and gas and parking expenses. 

The personal loan would be for around 17k with an annual interest rate of 26% meaning a total finance charge of about 13k and monthly payments of $487. In total paying $487 a month would be $300 less a month than what I currently spend paying off small debts. 

Does this sound like a good idea or am I being impulsive?",finance
personalfinance,Can I afford to go to grad school and start a family?,"I want to go to grad school to become a social worker, with the ultimate goal of becoming a LCSW and working as a therapist. This is largely because I want to make a decent wage in a position I enjoy, while also working a flexible, part-time schedule to that I can be present for my future kids. I have done my research and believe that, based on demand and prevailing wages in my area, I can earn about $35-40,000/year working as part-time social worker (which is about what I make when I work full-time at my current job). 

However, I'm 25 and currently in about $22,000 of student debt from undergrad (these are loans I took out when I was still considered a dependent and not eligible for any grants). These are all federal loans with about 5% interest. I graduate with my bachelors in December 2020 and because I'm old now, the rest of my undergrad tuition and books will be covered by federal and state grants. I currently have $1,000 in savings and will have all of my credit cards paid off by the end of the year. Then, I will put my credit card payment money towards paying down my student loans while I'm still in school. I have $500 per month budgeted for this, but it will jump to $1,200 per month for the summer when school's out and I'm able to work full-time. So, when I graduate, I will have about $13,000 in student loans to pay off.

My partner is ahead of me financially because his parents paid for his tuition and living expenses in cash so he never had student loans, so he is debt-free and currently working on building up his savings, but he is also taking on a larger share of our living expenses while I work part-time through school.

My partner and I are living without a car and don't need one right now, but I might need one to succeed in grad school. When we eventually buy a house, we will definitely need two cars because we will not be able to afford a house anywhere with useful public transit. I have no idea how much cars cost to own because I've never had one. 

Grad school tuition will cost $30,000 (2 years) from start to finish if I go full-time and don't work, but jumps to $45,000 (3 years) if I go part-time and also work. I don't feel confident that I can work part-time through grad school and earn enough money to cover enough of the tuition to make that extra $15,000 and year of interest worth it. I plan to apply aggressively for scholarships but I'm not optimistic. 

I want to meet all of the personal finance benchmarks -- putting 20% or more down on a home, owning our vehicles, having healthy savings, being debt-free -- but this feels impossible to do on a start-a-family timeline. Due to medical issues I've had in the past, I really don't feel comfortable with having my first kid later than 30-32. I guess this is what I get for not finishing undergrad until I'm 26.

My question is: It feels like I'll never be able to get my life together in time to have kids. What does a young couple *really* need to do before starting a family? Should I give up forever on grad school and expect that some other job that will pay me well to work 20 hours a week? 

Any input is appreciated, thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,"Cash-out refinance or ""Buy"" vehicle from spouse with financing - possible, reasonable?","Hi all, long time reader first time poster.

My husband and I got ourselves into a stupid position - namely about $50K of CC debt.  We've aggressively slashed our expenses, cut most discretionary spending, and traded my husband's car in to eliminate his car payment and save on gas.  We're throwing every extra dollar at the debt using the avalanche method.  

We considered selling my car to get something cheaper as well.  It's a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, and we currently owe approximately $12K at 3.99% (payments \~$590/mo).  We bought it new, so we know it's been perfectly maintained and it has zero issues.  KBB trade-in value is \~$22K with the options it has.

 We do a lot of off-the-beaten-path camping in places that a standard passenger car can't go.  This is a non-negotiable part of our lifestyle.  We've cut all of our other recreation, and camping is cheap to free.  We both have high-stress jobs, so we do need a way to ""get away"" and destress.  Typical campsites just make us more stressed, because people are loud and obnoxious, hence the ""off the beaten path"" primitive camping.  So I need to keep something comparable in size / performance.  However, everything I'm seeing on the used market has either been driven hard,  has way more miles than I'm comfortable with in a used car, or is priced at more than we currently owe on this jeep.  Therefore, we have decided to keep it.  


**On to my question:**

Currently, the Jeep loan is in just my husband's name and he is the registered owner.  We've looked at refinancing, but we can't seem to find a lender that will let us cash out the equity so we can throw it at the higher-interest CC debt.  It's possible we just don't know where to look.  Alternately, is it possible (California, if that matters) for me to get a loan to ""buy"" the car from my husband for $22K?  Would the lender question the fact that I'm buying it from my husband?  At purchase loan interest rates, I could lower my payments by $100+ per month (I'd probably do a 60-month loan and then just throw the extra money at the car loan once the CC debt is paid off) and pay off another $10K of the high-interest CC debt.  

We both have steady, stable jobs and there is little danger of us losing our jobs and being unable to pay our debts anytime soon.  Our actual expenses (excluding CC debt, but including the car loan) can be paid on either one of our salaries alone.  We simply succumbed to the allure of lifestyle creep as we got new jobs, and lost our minds for a few years with travel, etc that we'd never been able to do before.  We've learned our lesson successfully reined that in - we just need to get out of the hole we dug ourselves into.

As I said, we've determined that getting rid of this vehicle is not something that we're willing to do at this point, but I'd appreciate any advice on whether it's possible / reasonable to get the equity out of this vehicle so we can pay down the CC debt faster.  If I have to owe money, I'd rather owe it at &lt;5% vehicle loan rates vs 12% - 18% CC rates.

personalfinance,Need Some Convincing with Student Loan Refinancing,"I am deciding whether or not I should refinance by student loans. Any responsive comment is appreciated.

$15,500 at 5.84%

$13,000 at 6.21%

$9,000 at 5.41%

$4,000 at 4.5%

MEFA quoted a refinance interest rate of 3.9% for a 7-year repayment plan.

I have exactly 7 years remaining on my loans after this month.

Is it a no-brainer to refinance? I think I ""only"" save between $2,500 and $3,000 at the minimum based on my current payments, although I could save more if I added $200-300 more per month with the unallocated funds.

personalfinance,What to put savings towards once we get married?,"Hello,

I will be getting married in about 6 months.  My fiance and I make about the same amount of money, although she has about 150k of student debt, and about 450k mortgage, which I am currently paying rent for.  Eventually (maybe 5-6 years at most, we would like to get a single family home together instead of the townhouse she has now.  We have not decided whether or not to rent the current place or sell it.  My savings is about 1/3 maxed out 401k, 1/3 company stocks that I get as compensation,  and 1/3 cash that I set aside.  My idea originally was that I would save the cash for a down payment on a future house.  Since I thought that would happen in the relatively new term, I haven't invested that part of it, which will be about 160k by the time we are married.  I am wondering what would be the best option for that money, to help pay off the mortgage,  the student debt,  invest it, or continue to save for a house.  The interest rate on the house is in the ballpark of 4%, and the student loans are about 3.5%.  From a psychological perspective, it would feel good to not have student debt.  However, from a numbers perspective, the mortgage makes most sense.  Either one of those leaves a down payment being a lot smaller on a house.  And assuming I go with the student loans, how do I rationalize the fact that most of the hard earned money I have been carefully saving for years just evaporated?  I was thinking in that case to just divvy the payments on a future house in an uneven way to reflect the student loans.  Obviously that money will still be shared, but it won't seem as much like giving it away.  Maybe I am just being too selfish.  Thanks for any input!",finance
personalfinance,"If you use Ally HYSA for emergency fund purposes, consider their No Penalty CD for more security with no loss of flexibility.","The Feds likely to decrease interest rates yet again next week. If you have $25k or more in one of their savings account you can transfer it into a ""No Penalty"" CD they offer with just a few clicks.

At time of writing it offers 2.0% compared to the 1.8%, and being a CD that rate is locked in for 11 months.

The reason I'm highlighting this option over a regular CD is after the first 6 days you can redeem it, a long with ALL interest earned up to that point, with no penalty for early withdrawal.

If you do have an emergency and need access to it, it's just as easy as a few clicks back.

In the off chance interest rates go up in the next 11 months you can also cash it in and reopen a new one at the higher rate.

personalfinance,Post-bachelors gap year: Save or Pay Debt,"Hi all,

I am planning on trying to go to get my master’s degree after this gap year. My question is, would it be better to pay off as much of my undergraduate student loan as I can or should I save it for living expenses during my graduate program?

Current income: 2K/month
Current expenses: 1.8K/month
Current debt: 
     Roughly 17.75K in subsidized, federal (4.5% interest estimate)
     Roughly 7.75K in unsubsidized, federal (5.5% interest estimate)
     Roughly 25K in private loan (5.5% interest)

Would it be worth it to pay anything beyond the minimum payment on these loans since I’m going to try to defer them while in my graduate program?

Thanks!

personalfinance,Considering buying a vehicle what interest is acceptable?,"I'm looking at vehicles right now and intend to buy very soon. I'm trying to keep it under $10k. I recently found a car I really like but the interest rate is 16% through the people they finance with. I immediately got disgusted and told them that was unacceptable. My credit isn't perfect but it's not awful. I have three late payments on a credit card from 3 years ago and I have a fully paid off car I never missed a payment for on my record. According to credit karma it's a 660. I have submitted an application with my credit union but my past experience with them leads me to believe they will not give me a loan for a older higher mileage vehicle. It is appearing to me that in my current situation I will either have to go to a big dealer, like Toyota or Ford and get something newer and more expensive, or I will have to get something newer and more expensive to get my credit union to accept it. I do not like either of these options because I don't want to break $10k I don't drive a whole lot and consider anything over that target to be wasteful. But I don't want to get screwed on interest. I suppose my question is am I getting to hung up on the interest rate?

personalfinance,Capital One Savers - Switch to Performance Savings,"Capital One recently launched a new type of Savings account, [Performance Savings](https://www.depositaccounts.com/banks/capital-one-360/offers/), while discontinuing the old 360 Savings and Money Market accounts. If you have either of those legacy savings accounts, **switch to Performance Savings.** This new account type is better than both, but Capital One by default lets you keep the old accounts and does not automatically convert for you.

**Why is it better?**

* Performance Savings offers 1.9% APY over the 1.0% APY of 360 Savings (matches the 1.9% of Money Market)
* Performance Savings has no minimum, unlike the $10k minimum of the Money Market
* The article linked above provides more details

I don't work for Capital One and don't care if you switch from elsewhere. There are probably better interest rates elsewhere. However, I just personally found this out while trying to open a new savings account and was a little annoyed I was not getting the max interest available on my older savings accounts. I want to make sure all of you are earning higher interest as well.

I keep a lot of savings accounts, one for each of my near-term financial goals categories (e.g. emergency fund, home &amp; auto, vacations, charities, gifts, etc.), so it took me about an hour to convert them all over. Switching just one account [should take 5-10 min online](https://www.capitalone.com/bank/savings-accounts/online-performance-savings-account). Transfer your funds as the last step in the process, and you're good to go. Deleting the old account is a separate matter. I think you have to [call](https://www.capitalone.com/support-center/bank/360-contact), but let me know if there's a simpler way. I haven't tried that yet.

**Repost check:** I searched and found a few posts here related to Capital One Money Market and even Performance Savings, but nothing showing the need to switch to the new type.

personalfinance,Should I file FAFSA as an independent or dependent? Also should I file taxes?,"Hey Everyone: 

I'm trying to determine the best way to fill out my FAFSA (federal app for student aid) - either as an independent or dependent of my parents. 

I'm filing this for my 6th/ final undergrad year at a public university, I will be 23 when the upcoming academic year starts &amp; graduating at 24. I do not live at home/ rely much financially on family, but have been filing my FAFSA as a dependent up until now. My expected family contribution is usually close to $0  and I qualify for the Pell grant, Federal work study and other supplemental grants. However, I worked at an internship and earned about 13k, my total earnings this year (from part time jobs + internship) amount to about 16k. I also think age 23 is the last year I can be a dependent.  So my questions:

* Should I file taxes for my internship income? Do I need to file taxes to submit the FAFSA as an independent student? 
* Is it better to file the FAFSA as an independent or dependent based on my situation? Which option is likely to get more aid?

Ultimately I need to ensure i will still qualify for the pell grant, federal work study and other supplemental grants that usually comprise my aid package.

personalfinance,Factors that Impact Mortgage Rate,"I'm 26 and likely around 8-10 months away from purchasing a house.  At that point, I will have enough cash on hand for a down payment, closing costs, and six months emergency fund.  I didn't see anything about this on the wiki, but what would impact my mortgage rate?  I want to take this time period to put myself in a position to get the lowest rate possible.

Obviously there are some larger scale factors outside of my control like overall interest rates, but I'm not sure how things that are in my control that prove I'm ""less of a risk"" factor in and the extent they factor in.

My credit score is 810 and credit card balances are paid in full every month.  I have a car loan ($350/mo) which will be paid off in 9 months.  Would making sure I have that paid that off before I apply for a mortgage decrease my rate?  I'm not sure how much DTI factors in.  Is it more of a check - yes you're below the threshold on both front end and back end, so we'll approve you?  Or if you have an exceptionally low DTI you'd get lower rates because you're more likely to pay back?  

Student loans are $250/mo and I'm in no rush to pay them off because I still owe $23k and the rate is only 4%.

I'm sure having a sizable emergency fund would make me look like a lower risk, but since I'm not familiar with mortgages, does lower risk truly equal lower rate?  Obviously in the bug picture, a 20% down payment means lower risk than a 5% down payment, but that's covered by PMI.

Edit: The downpayment will be 20%.",finance
personalfinance,Building net worth for late starters,"1.5 years passed since my arrival to the US and the previous question ( https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7o2dcb/financial_advice_for_a_foreigner/ ) related to personal finance.

My brokerage account increased from 41.5k to 169k. I cannot build precise breakdown of balance growth because it was dirty mix for tax refunds, vested stock bonuses, discount stocks via the company ESPP plan and realized/unrealized short/long-term capital gains and unused paycheck surplus.

Monthly after-tax budget for spending including both necessities and discretionary expenses is $6.6k. Everything above goes to the brokerage account. Unused peanuts of monthly budget (usually between 0.3-1.1k) go to the savings account towards vacations.

There is also $3k on my Health Savings Account but it is used only for nothing more than medical checkups since we live a healthy lifestyle and do not need prescription medications against consequences of poor lifestyle.

One of mistakes was financing a pleasant European car. Luckily, I negotiated the final car price closer to bottom of KBB fair price, brought my own loan pre-approval at 4.5% for 5 years (with one month of the US-based credit history when FICO score was not even available) and added a GAP insurance via insurance company instead of dealer. The loan was initially aggressively paid and later refinanced twice to 4.11% and then to 2.99% for 3 years. I now pay exactly monthly payment without extra principal as return on investments is substantially higher than the loan interest rate. Had I chosen to buy a cheap used car the net worth would have been already above 190k.

I am looking for ways to accumulate net worth with good realistic rate of return. The address we rent has one the best public elementary, middle and high schools but real estate prices here are far beyond our means. It may be an option to pay rent for apartment in this awesome neighborhood and purchase some cheaper rental property somewhere else for folks not in need of the best school.
Option 2: throw away idea of buying real estate and just keep building net worth in liquid assets. Capital gains for average stock market return will exceed annual rent two years from now if I save comparable fraction of income the next year.

Do you have more ideas how to hoard assets so that their value grows over time?

I took out a $5k personal loan at a Credit Union two years ago to pay off 2 credit cards. I have kept the one with the 21% interest rate paid off, but I now owe just under $8k on the one with 17.99%. I am a few months ahead on my personal loan repayment, and might be able to get the balance to about $1200 by the end of the year if my roommate repays me for their share of our bills for the last 9 mos.

I will likely need to buy a car in the next year or so, depending on how my 1999 sedan does this winter, but I do not want to go from no car payment to big car payment with all this debt still in the queue.

My current plan is to pay off the Credit Union personal loan, and reapply for another loan through them to pay off and retire the credit card now that I don't need it to cover bills. While paying down that debt with a lower interest rate, I will chip away at the higher-interest student loans I have (the highest student loan interest rate is only 6.5%).

Banking,Bank Deducted Returned Deposit From Wrong Account,"Location: WA State - though this seems more broadly Federal/US banking regulation related

Background:  About five months ago, my sister and her husband had an unexpected plumbing emergency.  They were in the early stages of buying a house and were freaked out about using their credit card to pay for a plummer.  I put the charges to deal with their issue on my credit card.

My sister paid me back promptly.  I just forgot to deposit the check for several months when she finally nudged me to do it before the check was no longer valid.  I did last week into my savings account.  I got an email a few days later that my credit union (which is federally insured, etc) couldn’t honor the check.  The reason being was that my sister got distracted while writing the check and the pay to and summary amount don’t match.   Without meaning to, she wrote me a check for $5 dollars instead of $500 dollars (the pay to line was missing the hundred part).

What Happened:  After depositing the check, my bank contacted me by email to tell me that they could only deposit the amount written on the pay to lines so they were accepting the check for $5 instead of $500.   They withdrew the additional $495 from my checking account and let me keep the $5 the check was mistakenly written for.  My sister has already sent me a new check, so that’s not issue.

The bigger problem is that the check was deposited into my savings account and the $495 deduction was taken from my checking account.  These accounts aren’t linked other than my name is on both of them.  The nearly $500 deduction nearly sent me into overdraft.  My balance in my savings account remains at the new balance for when the check went through (and somehow cleared).

The Additional Complication:  The bank’s online system had been down (as it happened for a new product launch into their newly digitally reimagined online banking product).  So, I didn’t catch the deduction for a several days.  To make matters worse, my balance was showing as a substantial negative number for 3 days due to the multiple glitched out, not working ‘new‘ changes they imposed.

The Resolution:  I contacted my bank by telephone and also online customer service chat to find out why my bank was showing a negative balance over several hundred dollars.  The woman on the phone sheepishly explained that balances were broken as the result of the roll out and most everyone was showing negative when they weren’t.    She at that point reviewed the returned check with me.  I didn’t think much about it until I realized that the amount of money the bank had returned for the wrong check amount was $495.  

The Problem(s): 

The bank took the returned check funds from my checking account when the check never hit my checking account, was deposited only into savings, and their own records show such.  The only thing linking these account is my legal name.  

The glitches in the online banking system made the site unusuable for several days.  Balances were wrong, the site would crash, etc.  They finally seem to have it right but only the in the last 2 days but it made it that much harder to discover the dedication decision after the fact given the 2 days of lag time.

&amp;#x200B;

The Question:  

It looks like my bank just got lazy and withdrew the wrong amount from the wrong account.  I pointed out this error to them (via email) and I’m waiting for a response.  IT will probably be a couple days for their response.  In the meantime, I’m not sure taking money out of the wrong account (checking v. savings) is either standard practice or legal?  

I’d like the bank to fix this it in the meantime, what can I file to make sure my greviance form a regulatory agency is heard.  They went though some leadership changes, are a credit union, and were pretty good to deal with but service has really declined for over the last year.  I’m considering filling out a complaint as it shouldn’t take this long for them to respond to emails and they didn’t catch a savings withdraw vs. a checking error.  Both of these things seems fairly serious, how do I go about filing the right paperwork is filed above them so a complaint is put on the record about their business practices?  Which complaint form should I use?

I am not the best at finance/planning (pretty late to this adulthood thing considering my age), but I am decent at being frugal and save where I can (or attempt to anyways). What should I be doing with my earnings from an economical standpoint?

I know I should kill my debts (especially school) first. I have been paying slightly above the minimum payments, for a few years now while I am working. Is it better to just to dip into my savings and payout the school loan in full, rather than slowly paying it out because of accruing interest? Car will be paid for within another year or two at the rate of payments, or should I just wipe this out as well? Or should I pay off the higher interest school loans and continue to make above minimum payments on the lower ones?

The only reason why I am a bit hesitant to pay off the school loans in full, is that I was looking to purchase a condo/small townhome by myself within a few months or so (current house we live in is already on the market via my folks). So I'd still like an ample amount of savings for a 20% down payment of maybe a $140k-$170k condo/townhome plus cover the other costs of home ownership (mortgage, HOA, closing, furniture, utilities, future repairs etc.)

personalfinance,Should I pay my debt or my mom’s debt?,"For backstory: when I entered college, my mom had to take Parent PLUS loans out on my behalf for my tuition. As a result, we made a deal: she would pay on these loans until the grace period of my loans were up, at which point I’ll be expected to pay both my loans and her loans. It’s a fair deal, because technically she didn’t have to take loans out for me.

Between then and now, we both fell on some pretty hard times. I graduated with a degree in applied mathematics but I’m not sure what exactly I can/want to do with it, so I’ve had to take a $14/hr job to pay my loans. Likewise, my mom’s had a rough go of jobs and also had to take a job that doesn’t pay much more than I’m getting paid, and with the rest of her bills accounted for, she only has $74 extra. So, whereas she was intending to pay her loans to help me until I could get a better job, she’s now stuck and I need to pay both loans. Again, it’s a fair deal (in fact, she has a separate loan payment that’s about to finish in a year and after that, she will start helping to work on her loans. So in a year’s time, it’s both of us working on her debt, but for the next 12 months it’ll be just me).

Now, for why I’m posting: I’m 21. I don’t want to be a victim of a student debt horror story and be unable to dig myself out until I’m 40 like my brother. I’ve done my research on the payment methods and I’ve decided that the avalanche method will best suit me for the long run. The thing is, my highest-interest loan right now is 5.05%, only .5% more than my other loans. Meanwhile, my mom has a 7.45% interest loan that is much more than the rest of my loans. 

My question is: using the avalanche method, is it wise to put the excess towards my debt, or my mother’s? I’m conflicted because one is my *legitimate*, legal debt, while the other is my mother’s on my behalf. I view putting the extra on my loans instead of hers as building my personal credit, something I’ve never really done until now. However, would paying extra on her loans be able to boost her credit score and open up the possibility of refinancing her loans, lowering the payments and interest rates for me?

TL;DR: using the avalanche method, would it be a better idea to put my extra money towards *my* student loans (which are less money and have a lower interest rate but are in my name) or my mother’s Parent PLUS loans (which are more money and have a higher interest rate, but are technically not my loans and thus don’t affect my credit)?

EDIT: To clear any confusion, I would still be paying the minimum on *all* the loans; I just wanted to know where I should put extra money. I will put extra on my mom’s higher-interest loan first. As for my job, I unfortunately start this job tomorrow and I feel it would be just as dishonorable to quit my first few months, so I’ll have to thrive on $14/hr for now. Thank you everyone",finance

personalfinance,"61k in student loan debt, trying to get debt free in 2 years","I recently graduated in May with a total of just over $61,000 in loans (7 Sallie Mae loans and 3 Federal loans).

I found a job and began working immediately after graduating. My gross pay is $45,000 a year with potential commissions (it’s a sales gig). I have no other debt (I own my car, no credit card debt). 

Since starting in June, I saved enough money to pay one of my 3 federal loans off in full. I chose that one because it was unsubsidized, and it was small enough to just get rid of in one blow. I’m following Dave Ramsey’s debt snowball plan, so I’ll be tackling each loan smallest to largest while paying the minimums on all of the rest.

Last Friday I made my first round of minimum payments on the Sallie Mae loans (the federal loans stay in grace until December). So, the minimum payment was $593.

I can comfortably live on $1500 a month (probably even less, and that’s taking into account rent, food, utilities and car insurance). So if I live a simple life for a while I could potentially throw an additional 600-800 at my loans per month. Additionally, my family is awesome, so I anticipate a decent chunk of holiday cash, as well as a guaranteed $5,000 from my dad every year for extra assistance. Come March/April of next year I should get my tax return, so that’s another big chunk.

I don’t really have any specific question here, I just wanted to share where I’m at currently to show that we all start somewhere. For those of you who have had a similar experience to this one, I’d be interested to hear your story, and how fast you were able to get out of your debt!",finance

personalfinance,Switching banking institutions,"To start off my girlfriend and I have been together for a while and we use a joint account to keep all of our shared finances above board. It is a little more work but it keeps both of us honest and is a great way to make sure things dont fall through the cracks and we will continue to do this until we get married I believe. 

Now we have just bought a car together and we will be getting an auto loan from a local large credit union which we were very impressed with. The staff was helpful and actually helped my girlfriend refinance her student loans which have been making her terrified since finishing grad school. Overall the credit union made us feel rather comfortable and has a large base and approval in our area. We have talked a bit about how much we liked the credit union and we are considering moving our accounts together to this credit union.

The question I have is what decisions should I factor in when deciding on transferring accounts between institutions? Are there numbers I should be looking out for in interest rates? Or is it something that if I like the coffee and furniture at one place better then the other that's a justifiable reason to switch?

Right now in total we have accounts in 2 institutions which includes my savings account personal checking and joint checking at my bank institution. And my girlfriend has a personal checking, personal savings, credit card, and all of her private student loans (which we are moving anyways) at her institution. She does have a bit of cc debt with the card from this institution but not enough for either of us to be worried and even if we switch other accounts she does plan to keep this cc account open as it is her longest open credit line (which I'm not sure matters for credit scores as she does have other lines open). It does seem like a lot to move hut we do really like the institution and just want to get a better idea of what we should be looking for before moving.

Any and all input is greatly appreciated!",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin, Libra, &amp; Central Banks: A Conundrum","The prospect of a recession in the US and Europe is being priced in to markets everywhere (as of October 2019). Some countries are already in the midst of financial chaos—think Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey. As is usual in the face of such worries, the gold price has lifted. So has Bitcoin—up substantially YTD. 

Bitcoin critics are numerous, and have long been vocal in their claims that the project is criminal, or will fail, or that it offers no lasting value. Despite this, the market remains robust, and to date the Bitcoin blockchain has performed perfectly since its inception over ten years ago. New features to improve access, utility, and performance are being developed, and this track record, along with the blockchain’s complete transparency, which makes it a poor vehicle for criminal use, is an effective recruiting sergeant. The network metrics show that Bitcoin is increasingly popular. Several large financial corporations now offer their clients exposure to the crypto market, and to Bitcoin in particular, through plain custody as well as derivatives. In light of future financial uncertainty, most commentators expect further value flows into cryptos, and especially Bitcoin, which enjoys the majority of the sector’s liquidity and capital value.

With the discussions about Facebook’s Project Libra very much in the news, we are at the point where central banks are now considering how to respond to the advent of natively digital money. Whether the banks tokenize their own currencies directly, or adopt a mutual coin—perhaps in concert with other central banks or through the IMF—it seems certain that within a few years millions of people will be interacting with the financial system through programmable money rather than the “dumb” fiat we’ve all been using for centuries (and which will certainly continue, in parallel, for years to come). There will be numerous problems to overcome, to be sure, (for instance, many of the profit centers of commercial banks are obviated by crypto and so-called De-Fi [de-centralized finance] at a stroke, so such a momentous move must be carefully planned), but the advantages and efficiencies are substantial—too great to ignore. 

Switching to a digital currency regime does throw up some interesting issues. 

For example, at present, very few ordinary people do any “carry trading”—where you borrow in one currency to invest in another. The exchange rate risks are obvious and you have to be on your toes. But anyone using a tokenized currency can easily swap their depreciating national-currency tokens for another kind that is scarcer and which appreciates. This means that people could keep their wealth in a coin that appreciates (e.g. Bitcoin), and spend in their local currency (euros, dollars, etc, that depreciate) with their wallet making the required exchanges on the fly (if exchange is even necessary—many merchants will simply accept the appreciating currency). In other words, a sovereign digital currency that slowly depreciates (as they traditionally do) will inevitably be exchanged for one that is deflationary. Because the costs of doing so will be close to zero, and users’ wallets can make any necessary exchanges on the fly, the risk of loss due to exchange fluctuation is also close to zero. 

There are other questions that digital currencies throw up, such as how central banks avoid putting retail banks out of business. Doubtless the Game Theorists are having a ball.

As a result, the adoption or introduction of digital currency means that the existing monetary policies of sovereigns will have to change—and will surely have to be much more aligned with other nations. The standard 2% inflation target, for example, will have to be dropped. Seignorage by commercial banks will no longer be possible in the conventional way. The implications for structural debt are obvious and alarming. 

In short, governments are likely to be extremely cautious about adopting digital currencies, because although the advantages are substantial, the potential downsides are severe. The debate about whether and to what extent private institutions should be allowed to determine monetary policy or the money supply will intensify. The chances of any government ceding control of these levers to private hands look extremely unlikely in the current landscape. 

So for the coming few years at least, Bitcoin is the go to coin for people wishing to hold some of their wealth in a digital token. There is the possibility that one or more central banks will begin to hold some BTC as part of their reserves. This would obviously have a large effect on the market, so any such measures would probably be taken very gradually and secretly. There are good reasons why central banks—probably acting in concert—would buy BTC, not least to allow them to control this vital section of what will be a larger digital currency market in the future. Moreover, purchasing a controlling stake (which would be much less than 50% of the available coins) now would be a relatively trivial expense (perhaps 50 billion USD). Doing it in 5 years’ time might not (&gt;500 billion USD).  

If Libra doesn’t launch, then something very like it will, and it may be Chinese. This fear alone will probably drive US regulators to give Facebook a path to operation. And once we’re all using Libra to pay for everything, in any country, where will we put our savings, in this zero-rate environment? What instruments will offer the best return? Bitcoin may have a long way to go yet.",cryptocurrency

cybersecurity,I Am Looking For Your Cybersecurity Horror Stories,"Greetings. I have a request for all the cybersecurity pros out there. I am looking for your horror stories for my podcast, Security In Five (r/SecurityInFive) .

Being in the industry for 20 years I know behind the scenes how things really work, the decisions that are made and not made and the reasons why. I also know how most breaches occur from internal failures from negligence, Naïvety , or pure ignorance. Now, I am looking for yours.

The stories I am looking for are ones that I can spin into an educational message but also reveal reality.

Here are some examples of stories -

\- Arguing with the Chief Architecture Officer that internally across 3,000+ databases, active directory and hundreds of internal web applications in a Fortune 100 company has zero SSL deployed. The reason, the CAO said it caused too much overhead on performance and they were behind the firewall.

\- Arguing with a Director on a project who came up with an idea, that almost went forward, to send all the internal Active Directory passwords to a 3rd party company in case the Siteminder Federation authentication broke, the users could login directly at the 3rd party with their internal credentials. Nightly feed to the client, all internal accounts, clear passwords. (this one actually made it to a project decision step)

\- Simply discovering a breach, covering it up internally and telling no one during the fix.

Those are the reality shocks I'd like to hear. Fully, 100% anonymous. No names, no companies or descriptions that would identify the company. Any names of people submitted I'll change anyway.

Send them to [bblogger@protonmail.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/ac6sk6/i_am_looking_for_your_cybersecurity_horror_stories/mailto:bblogger%40protonmail.com) and maybe if they are legit sounding enough I'll get enough to do an episode series on them.

The truth hurts sometimes and the real behind the scenes stories need to be heard.

personalfinance,How to get a refund for an invalid charge from my cable company?,"I cancelled my Optimum (cable company; I had internet service from them) account a few months ago. When I first opened the account, I rented their modem. In September 2018, I bought my own modem and returned theirs. I have a receipt proving this.

I recently received an $80 bill from them. At the time, I assumed it was just my last month's service bill and just mailed them a check (dumb, I know), but I later learned it was for an unreturned modem. In addition, they debited it straight from my checking account before they received my check, since I guess they still had it on file.

So, in summary: I paid them $160 when I should have paid them nothing. I have called them 3 times and am getting the run around. It sounds like they are taking my word that I have a receipt proving I returned the equipment. Supposedly, I'm going to receive a refund in 7-10 days, but it sounds like it will only be for $80.

How should I handle this? At this point, I'm fed up and considering just disputing the payments with my bank. Would that be wise? Or should I at least wait to see what happens in 7-10 days?",finance

personalfinance,Should I wait to get a car or just go ahead?,"I did read the FAQ but like most FAQs it's not specific to my situation. Here is the deal. 

I am getting a new job (that pays double what I am getting now) and I REALLY need a new-to-me car. My new job is within my degree and it is something I am really excited about. I start in about a week. My current car is on its last legs and it is a money sinkhole to fix. It needs new brakes including the discs, it has a check engine light on, and has expired tags. The new job is further away so I want a car that won't implode when I need it the most. 

I have young credit so it is below 600. I can't get a cosigner so I am stuck with some of the higher interest rates (until I refinance latter in the life of the loan). 

I did budget and under the new job, I can afford a car payment of around $200-$250 (Around 5% of my gross monthly income). This budget did include putting away money for an emergency fund, other debts paid back faster, and a little spending money for stupid stuff I want to do. I can post the budget if you want to take a look. 

I have $3,000 to put down and for other fees. So put together allows for a $10,000 loan at about 3 to 4 years depending on the interest rate. This is a little under 20% of my gross annual, but I am ok with that. I want specific things in my car and I understand I have to pay for some of that. 

I would be going to a credit union to get pre-approved so I have negotiation power at dealerships or have a loan set up for private sale. I am getting only a used car. 

Now the question is should I start the car buying process now while transferring jobs or wait a few months? I really need a new car but I don't want to struggle to get a decent loan because of my employment. Thank you for all your replies.",finance

personalfinance,Need Advice on finances moving forward,"Personal finance is not something I usually chat with too many friends about so I just thought Id ask here for some general advice. 

Background: 

Married with 2 children (age 2 and 4)

Age: 38 and wife is 33

Location: California 

Gross Salary: $210k (combined dual income, both federal employees in healthcare, net a little over $10/month combined)

Retirement Contributions: Wife max TSP, I put in $16k/year ($35k combined + $10k matching/year), Both max Roth IRA ($11k/year)

529 Conbtributions: $6000/year

Debt:

$360k mortgage @ 4% 30 (27 left) year fixed (PITI is about $2500, pay about $2700/month, no HOA)

\*No other debt. 2 cars paid off. We plan to buy a 7-8 seater SUV, but timeframe unknown. Could be anywhere between the next 1-5 years. We are both fortunate to never have school loans or credit card debt. 

Assets: 

$200k cash (emergency fund in mostly high yield savings/CDs)

$25k after-tax investments (various stocks, mutual funds)

$190k (Vanguard roth IRA)

$250k (TSP, old 401k/457)

$30k in 529 plan

Other: Bought/sold home in 2017. Home value is about $565-575k. We both also use to work for the state so have CALPERS account. She is vested with 5 years so can obtain pension at 55 (12.5%). I only have 4.5 years so I could cash it out or go back to the state again one day. We also have pension through FERS. It’s likely at least one of us will stay as a federal employee. 

Jobs have room for growth for income potential of about 10-20% in the next 7-8 years (without taking into consideration of potential annual cost of living increases). That 10-20% would obviously be much higher if we get yearly cost of living increases/raises during that timeframe, but historically we had a lot of pay freezes, which almost happened again last year. For 2020 it appears 2.6% (less likely 3.1%) may happen. 

With that being laid out I know we have excessive cash that could be better used. Debating how much of it to put into mutual funds and stocks. Debating if it’s worth being more aggressive with or mortgage? It would be nice to pay it off in half the time for piece of mind, but I know I can get better returns with investing. We want to purchase an investment property one day. When that happens we don’t know. We regret not renting at least 1 of the 2 previous homes we sold, but it is what it is. 

Anyway how would you move forward from here? Next year I plan to just max my TSP. I think we are behind on retirement for our age. Our goal is to max TSP and roth IRA as long as possible, ideally all the way through retirement. We are still able to save a little, but kids are expensive and we still love to travel and enjoy life a little even though we try to stay frugal. A huge impact on our saving/spending next year will be if we decide to go private school or not. If we don’t, we could save another $8k/year and then $15k/year when the 2 year old starts. Currently the cost of daycare/preschool is about the same so it will be a wash. Is $500/month towards 529 plan enough for 2 kids? 

I know we are doing pretty decent compared to most people, but I guess when I read what some others are doing (especially on boglehead), I feel like we are way behind or not doing enough. I personally could have done more earlier in my career and have significantly more in our retirement, but can’t turn back to clock, that’s why I want to max everything out to catch up for now.",finance
personalfinance,Points Changed in Final Disclosure,"Our original loan estimate came in with a 3.375 interest rate at .366% of points.

Long story short the original guy wasn't pleased and we got sent another estimate with the original numbers.  The reasoning was the appraisal came in lower than the estimate said (620) while the estimate was for 660.  I have no idea where 660 came in because we bought it at 605 and I told them it was about 630 when they asked.  660 is insane and knew that wasn't going to happen.  Our PMI increased slightly which I knew would happen (something like $30 per month since the LTV went from 84 to 89).

Now where I live there’s a USDA loan where I can put zero down with a fixed interest rate (which I currently have at 3.75%). With my profits I will be able to pay off loans on 2 vehicles and my wife’s credit card. The difference from a 20% down monthly payment and 0% down is roughly $280 a month. The amount I’d save on riding myself of three payments would be around $500.  I would also have enough left over to make any updates on the new house as well. 

I have a small amount saved up that I use as my emergency funds, only about $3000. So I can’t put much other than the profits of the sell to a down payment. Would it be a bad decision to buy this house without a 20% down? Also, I am aware of the PMI on this type of loan, it came out to about $55 a month. 

Also I might be curious if anyone had any insight on the future of the current housing market? Does a hike in minimum wage have a chance to make the market increase?",finance
personalfinance,Car has been in the shop for warranty repairs for 3 months now,"I own (Financing) a 2006 jeep commander.  I purchased the car 2 years ago along with a 3 year warranty. from a large family of dealerships located in Colorado. I mostly use it to go back and forth to work but also work grubhub about $200 a week. The car has run pretty well and most of the problems it has had have been fixed under warranty but it has always been a fight to get them to do it. recently (July 25th) I brought the Jeep in to get some suspension components replaced. Usually there is a rental car to take so I am not out of a vehicle. I was told they would not provide one. I explained the warranty contract and showed them where it states that a rental car will be provided. They still refused, they said that what was going to happen is when the repair gets authorized and the parts arrived they can get me a rental. So I settled and let them diagnose my car and I would return the same day and continue to drive my car until it is authorized to be repaired. 

I called every day for the next three weeks getting different answers, finally I went in and talked to the service department manager (Zack) and explained my situation. He apologized and we set up an appointment (august 23rd) for my jeep to come in and they would fix it the same day so i would not need a car rental. I was having battery issues that day so I had it towed in early in the morning and left the keys in the night drop box. Later that day I gt concerned that I had not heard from anyone so I called 1/2 before they closed, no answer. The following day I  Finally get a hold of Zack He says they are still working on my jeep and it will be done today even gives me his cell number.  No word for the rest of the day and same scenario I call and get no response I txt Zack and he does not respond. Finally Zack txts back sunday night and tells me to go to enterprise in the morning and get a rental they will cover everything. Monday morning I get my gf to drive me there and pick up a rental. I have to pay $50 deposit and im told $2.50 per day which at the time seems ok because my jeep should be done very quickly. 

August 23rd I ask for an update, ""the motor has failed"" I am completely confused because I brought this in for suspension work and haven't had any motor issues at all. He says not to worry its covered under warranty it should take two weeks and i already have a rental. Over the next month I  go back and fourth with Zach trying to get this done asap. I also found out that the dealership is well understaffed and he is the only service writer all the others could not pass drug tests. September 25th I find out that the rebuild of the motor has failed and I will need a new crate motor. I provided him with my service records and receipts to get it submitted again asap. 

October 10th i finally hear that the new motor is ordered. That is the last I heard from Zach. Continue calling 2x a week to try and get more answers but all i am told is that they will call me back or they are working on it. Friday I actually got off early and decided to head in hoping for good news. I found out Zack had walked away from the company and 2 new people from another store were temp transferred to help. Zack had never done any of the paperwork for my jeep and did not submit anything.  The motor is there but still not approved. Up until this point I have remained calm and respectful to everyone because I have respect for other people and I know its no fun to get yelled at. After the update I asked to speak to a manager, He was not in but would be in the following day. I returned early in the morning, The manager they wanted me to talk to had called in. So i asked to speak to the general manager. 

The general manager is a nice guy listens to the scenario and is very understanding. The first thing he wants to do is offer to buy the jeep and get me into something else. I have been thinking about getting a new truck for a while so I told him im open to the idea but it would have to be the perfect deal. So i tell him my conditions they would buy my jeep for what i owe plus 1k and i would buy from then a used truck 4x4 crew cab and less than $300 a month. He does not have any trucks that would work for those numbers but does want me to buy a new dodge journey instead. I test drove it and explained that I am too tall for that car and it just does not work for me he then tells me that my payments would be $496 a month. I told him I do not want this deal at all.

TLDNR: Jeep not fixed dealer dropped the ball for 3 months and as of now I will owe over $150 in rental charges for a car i hate driving and cannot use for my 2nd job and down close to $1600 in lost wages. Also diminished value of the car, countless hours trying to get this fixed.

The jeep was put on the lift today and they will submit pictures to get this approved soon, I do not want a brand new car i cannot afford. alternatively I know my jeep needs new tires and a new windshield would I be out of line in asking for these items or should i get a lawyer.",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my VA loan that is less than a year old?,"My wife and I our first time homeowners and recently purchased a home as part of our military move (she is active duty).  We bought the house back in February and locked in what at the time felt like a pretty decent rate of 4.25%.  We made sure that we were keeping our house expenses reasonable, though the house we ended up getting is right at the top of our 33% of income budgeted for house payment.  We both have full-time jobs and excellent credit, 750+.


So we get settled in and just in like the last month started getting bombarded with mail saying we have passed the VA waiting period and can now refinance our house.  We of course ignore these and treat them as the junk mail that they are.  However we are getting like 4-5 every single day and pretty much all of them are saying there is a VA refinance program we should be taking advantage of that would drop our interest rate, and monthly payment significantly.  Like interest rate to between 2.5-3.5%, and a cut in monthly paying by about 35%.  Sounds too good to be true, so my gut assumption is that it isn't.  But it would be great to lower the interest on our house, which has actually gone up in value since we purchased it.  So I thought I'd share the question with the wisdom of the collective and see if any of you fine folks had knowledge about this that I just don't?

Also if I were to consider refinancing, I would NOT use one of these mailer companies.  I would definitely shop my own banks to do so.

personalfinance,Should I take out a personal loan to consolidate my CC debt,"So  I have about 10k in CC debt from irresponsible CC management from my College days. I also have about 25k in student loan debt and a 17k Car loan. I make about 67k a year. I have never missed a payment or been late Currently, I can make my payments but just the minimums. At the rate I am going the soonest I would pay them off is 13 years. I am 25 years old and I simply don't want to be bounded by this debt for that long. 

I was approved for a $9500 loan through Upstart with a 12.49% interest rate and would pay $301 a month for 36 months. I am currently paying about $382 in minimum payments at an average APR of 24% 

Here's one more catch. I still intend to use my CC's BUT only for work expenses which I get reimbursed. I do have a couple of travel rewards cards and cashback cards that I would like to enjoy the perks of. I intend to pay off that old debt. As well as my Student loans (Pay off 2028) and Car loan (Pay off est 2024). 

The plan is to pay the bills that I currently have on autopay (Phone, internet, car insurance, etc) on my cards (Spread across the ones with the best benefits) and set up an autopay to pay off the balances each month.  I will remain focused on paying off all debt! But also want to balance keeping a good credit score. I don't want to run the risk of having my accounts closed due to inactivity which would hurt my credit age (hence using the cards for work expenses and auto payments). 

Would this plan work? Or am I kidding myself and this is absolutely stupid?",finance

personalfinance,A 24 y/o with a question about beginning my FIRE path.,"A little about me. I'm 24 years old, and I work as a surgical nurse. I have a passion for travel, and intend to reach FIRE in the pursuit of living a mobile life.

I currently have $32,000 (deferred, but accruing) in student debt, $5,800 (11.29% APR) and $3,000 (0.00% APR) in revolving debt, and $6,500 (5.49% APR) worth of installments. My monthly expenses including rent, utilities, subscriptions, minimum financial obligations, and ect totals $1200. I could probably shave off 50-100 per month in this area.

I currently net $2,300 base pay per month, with an extra $200-$600 per month based on call pay and overtime. I have been offered a travel assignment making $2017 per week, $8,068 per month. Some of this is tax free, and I expect to net $6762 per month and I expect to save $10,000 by the end of the 13 weeks. I will need to find another assignment at the end of March.

I am attempting to purchase a multi family unit and I'm currently enrolled in the NACA mortgage program, and expect to have little difficulty becoming approved. This is a program that offers you a loan with no closing costs, no down payment, no PMI, ect. The only mandatory expenses total at most $4,500. I will have the opportunity to buy down the interest rate, 1% of the loan buys down the 30 year (3.35% APR) by 0.25%, or buys down the 15 year (2.75% APR) by 0.5%. I intent to apply for a grant or two.

**My dilemma rests here;** I am trying to determine the most reasonable way to go forward. I would like to pay down my debts, but at the same time, come spring, I will have an opportunity to purchase a rental property at close to 0.0-0.5% interest. I'm looking at buying a property at up to $250,000 in either a college (3-4 units) or suburban (2-3 units) district, and want to know why I should pick one over the other. I would be an owner occupier for the life of the loan, but intend to take 3 month travel assignments 9 months out of the year.

The other 3 months would be spent in my hometown working a ""care-free"" job. Gardener, barista, librarian, baker, ect. I know I wouldn't be earning any real income during that period, but I expect to have enough saved and enough coming in to have no net loss during those 2-3 months. I chose the nursing career so I can live the lifestyle I want outside of work. I know by taking time off I am delaying FIRE, but I feel that it isn't a race, but a destination. It's important to enjoy the journey and I plan to do just that.

Thank you in advance for your time and your insight.

TLDR;

I will be earning an extra $10,000 over the next 3 months. I expect to earn this extra income as a travel nurse for the next 2-3 years with breaks in between. I have $15,000 in c.c and auto debt, and $32,000 in student debt. I have the opportunity to buy a multi family home at 0.0%-0.5% APR. With that extra money, by next spring;

* Should I pay down debt, or save my new income to buy down interest on a future owner occupied rental property?
* If i should get the rental, should I buy a 3-4 unit college rental, or a 2-3 unit suburban rental?
* Do you wish you had spent more time enjoying life on your FIRE journey?
* Should I continue nursing, work a 'care-free"" job, or take off for a vacation for 2-3 months a year?
* What do you wish you had done differently along the FIRE path?",finance

personalfinance,I'm in such a debt crisis that it's seriously affecting my will to live. I need help (US),"I know this isn't a mental health support sub but it's really intertwined with my financial life so I have to include some of it. 

I was severely mentally ill while I was in college. I just lay in bed for days at a time. I got fired from a job I had and didn't have the energy to find another and I didn't think I'd get hired anyway. Tried giving plasma but they screwed up and I got deferred for a few months. At that point I had literally no source of income (no family to borrow from) so I started using the food bank they had on campus to have food. Unfortunately it was very minimal and sometimes didn't have anything at all, so at times I had no choice at all but to buy groceries with my credit card (nobody to borrow money from either in terms of family or friends.) I couldn't access any other food pantry or free food source that I knew of. Thanks to /r/eatcheapandhealthy I managed to keep my grocery bills pretty low, but it still added up and when I wasn't able to make any payments on my credit card it wasn't long until I maxed it out. 

At that point, no money, no food, failing all my classes, no job, already extremely depressed, I attempted suicide. Was forced to withdraw from school and go to the hospital, where I at least got to eat but I knew the whole time I was racking up a fortune in debt. I had every intention of going back to college once I recovered mentally, but that still hasn't happened. 

That was spring 2018 that that all happened and so it's obviously been a long time of me not being in school. Because of that I'm expected to be paying back my student loans already, all of them which is almost $30,000 split up across a bunch of different loans and payments that I don't even know how to keep track of. I also have about another $8,500 in medical debt from the hospital, and ~$1,000 in credit card debt. So close to $40,000 all said and done and I'm supposed to be paying all of this right now. 

Some of my student loans are federal and some are private. I know I have a bunch of different loans with individual terms that I got from the FAFSA list and everything but I don't know how to figure out those details for each one. 

From another post I recently made on another sub just for convenience's sake:

&gt;My credit is sub-400 because so much of this has gone into collections and I haven't been able to keep up with payments. I eat on like $1 a day, have a cheap phone plan, a shitty car that needs so many repairs it could die at any second, live with abusive alcoholic parents because It's at least rent-free even though the abuse is intolerable, and work as much overtime as I can at the job I hate on top of giving plasma twice a week and it still isn't enough. By the time I make even 3/4 of my payments I have and pay for food and gas to get to work and back I have basically no money for anything including saving. That's working as much as I can and giving plasma and not a penny into savings and it still isn't enough, and other things just become more and more delinquent in collections so my credit only gets worse and worse. Some of these things I'm only even making interest payments so I'm literally making no progress whatsoever on the actual debt.

So I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm doing my absolute best and I just can't make it. This is realistically the best paying job i'll be able to get right now and I'm working as much as I can. Short of getting an entirely second full time job and working close to 100 hours a week I don't see what to do. I make about $1500/month but almost every penny of that goes to debt and necessities like I said. I have more and more things going into collections though because I can't keep up. i don't have any family or friends that could help me, my bank account is overdrawn $100 right now, and I have a whole $6 in savings. Due to my account being overdrawn I don't even know how I'll be able to eat or afford gas to work this month. 

I know bankruptcy could remove my medical and credit card debt, but wouldn't do anything for my student loans which are the majority of the debt anyway do i don't know if bankruptcy would be worth it, and i'd also feel horrible declaring bankruptcy at the ripe old age of 22. I wouldn't recover until I was in my 30s. Someone told me to come here to see if there are any consolidation plans or if I should actually file for bankruptcy and if so how to do any of that.

investing,[Reuters] Three-peat? Fed copies 1990s playbook in bid to avert a downturn,"[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed/three-peat-fed-copies-1990s-playbook-in-bid-to-avert-a-downturn-idUSKBN1X80EX](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed/three-peat-fed-copies-1990s-playbook-in-bid-to-avert-a-downturn-idUSKBN1X80EX)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the midst of what became a golden decade for the U.S. Federal Reserve, central bankers twice in the 1990s cut interest rates in short bursts that managed to help the U.S. economy continue growing despite slowing investment and weak growth overseas. 

Today’s Fed hopes a third time proves just as charmed.

In their latest two-day policy meeting this week, Fed officials look set to nudge the economy along in similar fashion with their third consecutive rate cut. That would match the moves made by then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in 1995 and 1998 during an era known as “the Great Moderation” for its steady growth, falling unemployment and tempered inflation.

There’s been no clear commitment to another reduction in borrowing costs from Fed policymakers, though a failure to lower rates on Wednesday could risk upending financial markets that are confident another cut is coming. With billions of dollars in bets on futures markets tied to anticipated Fed actions, any deviation by the U.S. central bank from the expected course typically leads to sharp swings in bond and stock markets.

A rate cut on Wednesday, which would be the Fed’s third this year, would lower the overnight benchmark lending rate to a new range of between 1.5% and 1.75%. Policymakers may emphasize that “the three cuts cumulatively have served to balance the risks to the outlook,” and will likely keep the economy on track, JP Morgan economist Michael Feroli wrote last week.

The Fed is scheduled to announce its latest policy decision at 2 p.m. EDT on Wednesday (1800 GMT). Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a news conference half an hour later.

Policymakers likely won’t shut the door to further action, but may “communicate patience in deciding future policy moves,” TD Securities analysts wrote last week.
GAINING LEEWAY

Investors have no firm opinion on when the Fed will move again after Wednesday, a signal to Powell and his colleagues that if they deliver the expected cut this week they will have room to shape market expectations moving forward.

According to CME Group's FedWatch tool here the probability of a rate reduction on Wednesday stands at 94%. After that, however, it's a coin toss whether there will be any further change for at least a year.

That in itself is a success for Powell. Beginning last fall, the Fed confronted a widening gap between what policymakers at that point thought would be continued rate hikes, and the expectations of investors who began factoring rate cuts into their outlook as a global economic slowdown took hold around the intensifying U.S.-China trade war.

The Fed, under pressure to lower rates from President Donald Trump but also watching U.S. investment and manufacturing data weaken, reversed course early this year.

Financial markets have responded with largely easier borrowing conditions, and lower rates on important benchmarks like 30-year home mortgages. Key aspects of the bond market, watched by some Fed officials as evidence of faith or lack of it in near-term economic growth, have been looking steadily healthier.

Some of the ongoing problems like the trade war with China and the prospect of a disorderly British exit from the European Union also have lightened, at least a bit.

That has helped narrow the gap between the Fed and global market expectations.

It may have helped narrow gaps within the U.S. central bank as well. Even those Fed officials who have been most eager to cut rates now feel that one more quarter-percentage-point reduction should be adequate for the year.
THEN AND NOW

Today’s circumstances share a number of similarities with those confronting the Fed roughly a quarter of a century ago.

In July 1995, Fed officials, as now, debated whether slower-than-expected growth would impair business investment, spilling over into hiring plans and, ultimately, household spending.

Just as weak growth in Europe is seen as a risk for U.S. companies today, a weak outlook for Canada and Japan was a concern then, according to minutes of the meeting at which the Fed adopted the first of three rate cuts in six months.

“During the last six weeks my optimism has diminished,” said former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who was president of the San Francisco Fed at the time. Without action by the Fed “we could easily end up, I think, in an extended growth recession.”

Fast-forward to the present, and again the economic data has not been great.

The most recent jobs and retail sales reports were both weak. Economists polled by Reuters expect economic growth slowed in the third quarter to an annual rate of 1.7%, from a 2% pace in the second quarter. The advance estimate of gross domestic product is due to be released on Wednesday, before the Fed concludes its policy meeting.

As the 1990s proceeded, it took two such rounds of “mid-cycle adjustment,” about two years apart and each involving three rate cuts of a quarter of a percentage point each, to keep that recovery on track. It was derailed by the bursting of the dot-com stock market bubble, with a recession starting in March, 2001.

The expansion since the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession has already eclipsed the 1990s to become the most prolonged period of sustained growth in U.S. history.

While the pace has sometimes been tepid, Powell and his colleagues argue there is no reason it can’t keep going, and have pledged to act “as appropriate” to try to make it so.

At a speech in Denver earlier this month, Powell nodded to both the risks facing the U.S. economy, but also to its ongoing growth.

On balance, “this feels very sustainable,” he said.",finance

ByteDance, the $75bn Chinese start-up that owns the short-form video app TikTok, is eyeing an initial public offering in Hong Kong as soon as the first quarter of next year, according to two people briefed on its plans.

The seven-year-old company, which also owns the Chinese news app Jinri Toutiao, has chosen Hong Kong over New York, despite the recent turmoil in the territory. The benchmark Hang Seng index has lost about 11 per cent from its high earlier this year amid mass street protests and civil unrest.

ByteDance’s valuation hit $75bn in October 2018 when it closed a $3bn funding round led by SoftBank, doubling its worth from a year earlier. An IPO would crystallise big gains for early investors such as the Chinese arm of Sequoia Capital and would also help SoftBank at a time when the value of its investments in companies such as Uber and WeWork has sharply fallen.

A ByteDance spokesperson said: “There is absolutely zero truth to the rumour that we plan to list in Q1. Full stop.”

One of the few Chinese companies to have made significant inroads into international markets, ByteDance is facing increasing political pressure. In India, politicians have accused TikTok of inciting racial hatred and spreading pornography. The app was briefly banned earlier this year.

In the US, senators Charles Schumer and Tom Cotton last week called for intelligence officials to investigate TikTok, which has become a teenage craze, over the “national security risks posed by its growing use”.

The company has hired a team at the law firm K&amp;L Gates, which includes Gordon Bart, a former chair of the US House committee on science and technology, to advise on public policy. Its investors are also trying to quell Washington’s opposition to TikTok ahead of the potential listing.

“They need more political heft before they go public,” said one banker briefed on the IPO plans. “Even if they list in Hong Kong, they still need to address the concerns of US investors.”

To minimise the growing US backlash, ByteDance plans to sell TopBuzz, its US news feed business, which has a readership of 300,000, according to a people briefed on the plans.

ByteDance is also hiring a number of former US officials to help it address concerns raised by both Republican and Democratic congressmen in regard to Chinese companies. It is seeking to hire a chief legal officer and staff with Washington connections to push back against concerns ranging from data privacy to whether it is enforcing censorship at the behest of the Chinese government.

These initiatives follow Senator Marco Rubio’s recent calls for a review of ByteDance’s $900m purchase of the [Musical.ly](https://Musical.ly) app in 2017.

TikTok’s success has been powered in part by [Musical.ly](https://Musical.ly)’s technology but Mr Rubio alleged that TikTok has censored news on topics sensitive to China, such as the protests in Hong Kong and alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. ByteDance’s US general manager, Vanessa Pappas, has categorically denied those allegations.

ByteDance reported revenues of between $7bn and $8.4bn for the first half of the calendar year, according to Reuters, and was profitable in the month of June.",finance

Banking,For a friend: Refi or interest-only probability? [US-MN],"Trying to help a buddy get his financial life in order. He currently has a 4.25% conventional mortgage from a pretty large regional bank and I was wondering if he would be eligible for a refi, OR if maybe he could pay interest-only for a couple years so he could focus on paying down his cc debt (~21% avg interest rate)?

* 795 Credit Score
* $42k stable annual income (probably ~$31k after tax)
* $1500 in annual interest from CC debt (he's gonna balance transfer this for a $240 fee so it'll become $0 for the next 18 months)
* $700 in annual interest from student loan debt
* $4100 in annual mtg interest. Bought 2br-townhome for $110k in 2016 and put 10% down. I'd say it's conservatively worth $125k now. He has ~$97k left on that 4.25% conventional (w/ PMI) loan.
* With no changes to his current spending/income situation he'll likely add another $2k to his cc debt over the next 12 months (he used to have a live-in GF paying $6k/year in rent which kept him in the black).

I know:

1) This could be posted in r/personalfinance too

 2) That he needs to call his bank ASAP and start this convo with them.

3) His most bullet-proof option is to find another roommate.

However, any chance a bank would drop his rate down to 3.5% or 3.75%, and am I wrong to think his bank might let him pay interest-only for a couple years so he can focus on paying down that much higher CC debt?

personalfinance,"Decisions,Possibly Stupid Decisions","So I had to buy a bhph car last year(2005 Ford Taurus currently at 118kmiles)as I was in a somewhat tough spot and all it's done this year is given me problem after problem to the point where of course I'm paying more on repairs than actually driving it. At first it was spark plugs changed those when I first got it. They Stopped the car multiple times then it just wouldn't start. Ac was already bad in the car pushing out hot air. Then earlier then year it was stalling and I didnt want it to lock up so I had to put in a whole new ac mount drive kit which cost about 400$ since I'd asked a family member who knew a mechanic then the regular 7-800k it would have cost. Throughout the year it's still stalled on me multiple times at really bad times sometimes.Recently the starter stalled the car. Had to fix that (that was 500$ more I had to shell out)and that wasn't event the problem since the car crank no started on me a couple weeks ago. I figure it's the alternator now acting up but wont know til I take car in again. If it is that's probably another 5-600 more and who knows if not.

 Im at 24kish a year relatively young person here. At first it was 6900$ then after all paperwork and interest it bumped to 11k$ when I first got it in 2018. I do not see or know the interest rate of the car as it isnt clearly there in the contract. A year passed on Oct. 2nd of having the car and making payments so I'm currently sitting on 6200 left to pay

My only other big expense besides that is internet bill and insurance. But I've split them up where they balance out between my checks.I dont want to return it for fear of affecting my credit score but at the same time its emotionally and life draining to continue paying on a useless hunk of junk. Theres also my credit card had for 2 years now on time payments which I wanted to ask for an increase but I'm nowhere near the capacity of the card atm moment to ask for one since everytime I save up to get it back up car goes bad and I use it for that. 

I've finally began starting to save 20% of my check but now it's a battle of do I want to save enough to fix this car and it goes to crap on me again while still paying it or save up for another and at least have a more reliable ride but possibly still paying on it. 

I've thought of just buying another car full out(between 1k-2k$)while still paying on the junk since I just dont want to go through all of that legal hassle. I've also thought of buying from an actual car dealership but then that's taking on another contract I cant afford. Then I had another idea of just to continue to save up money till the end of the year which should net me around 3ishk then buy a car full out for 1-2kish while still having some saved up on the side for emergencies and/or repairs. My last idea I had was to pay off credit card and ask for an increase.

 Any thoughts or ideas? Is paying on it while getting a new car worth it? Let me know if I can provide more context please.

Update- Turned the car in, cleanly and gave them the keys back. Didn't have to pay any return fees as this bhph made u if u didn't keep the car longer than 13 months. Got out of the bad deal and into a newer, efficient car 👌",finance

solar,Help with quotes,"I'd like some feedback on the following quotes for my house in South Carolina. We only moved in earlier this year, but we estimate our annual energy usage to be around 20,000 kwh. At roughly 12c/khw, this equates to roughly $200 per month in power bills. Our utility offers net metering, but will not pay out for any negative usage when it resets the calculation each June. Therefore, we would like to size our system to cover a good chunk of our energy usage, but not all of it. In addition, we have limited south facing roof space, so it would be tough to squeeze many more panels than the quotes below do.

I'll share my thoughts after the quotes. All prices are pre-tax incentives.

A. 32 310W Trina panels (9.92 kw system) for $28,800. Priced at $2.90 per watt or $1.93 per kwh. 

B. 28 370W LG panels (10.36 kw system) for $37,814. Priced at $3.65 per watt or $2.37 per kwh.

C. 28 305W Hanwa qcells (8.5 kw system) for $26,474. Priced at $3.10 per watt or $2.01 per kwh.

D. 29 370W Sunpower x-series (10.7 kw system) for $37,650. Priced at $3.51 per watt or $2.59 per kwh.

E. 23 410W Sunpower a-series (9.43 kw system) for $28,271. Priced at $3.00 per watt or $2.07 per kwh.

F. 29 327W Sunpower e-series (9.48 kw system) for $26,656. Priced at $2.81 per watt or $2.12 per kwh.

All are using Enphase microinverters. Quotes A and C are using IQ7. Quote B is using IQ7+. Quotes D-F are using the Sunpower integrated version of the Enphase microinverter.

The quotes are from three different installers (installer 1 had quote A, installer 2 had quotes B and C, and installer 3 had quotes D, E, and F). 

Installer 1 offers a 1 year production guarantee. Installer 3 offers a much more robust warranty both in terms of panels (Sunpower) and a 10 year production guarantee. Installer 2 offers standard manufacturer warranties.

I'm leaning toward quote E because of the warranties and production guarantee. In addition, while I know using estimated kwh isn't terribly accurate, both it and quote F are based on Sunpower's internal estimates, so they should be ""wrong"" is the same way. And, using those estimates, because there are fewer microinverters and larger panels, the A-series panels are expected to generate more energy more cheaply than the E-series in quote F.

For reference, SC has a 25% tax credit in addition to the federal tax credit. Therefore, the final price for each of the quotes can essentially be cut in half.

Am I looking at this the right way? Is there anything I'm missing?",energy

I applied for a loan on LendingClub and also LendingTree because those were literally the only two places I knew to check.

Basically, I’m a college student who was receiving the federal pell grant. I got really sick, and against my better judgement, stayed in classes instead of pursuing treatment. I also had a number of other things going on, like deaths in the family, etc. But the biggest financial issue was that my car stopped working. I spent all the money I saved in high school trying to fix it. Then, as much as I hate to admit it, I let my grades slip dramatically, and went from an A student to a C or D student. Safe to say, I lost the pell grant. I didn’t realize I owed money until they sent a letter while I barely had anything in my bank account. The time elapsed quickly, I didn’t understand credit so I didn’t apply back then, I missed the deadline, and shortly thereafter I was sent to collections.

Long time lurker, first time poster. I am actually very lucky to be in a position where I feel the best about my finances than I ever have since my husband(26M) and I(22F) first started living together, three years ago. This is mainly because I have been very proactive in the last month in getting all 20k of our credit card debt (was spread across three cards at 26%, 14%, and 23% with a lot of the balance being compounding interest) onto 3 new 0% intro apr balance transfer cards. Before we were paying $600 a month towards all three cards but were barely making a dent because of compounding interest and the fact that we were continuing to make charges. Now the old cards are not in our wallets and not being used and new cards are maxed out with balance transfers but also will not be used even as they are paid off. We are in a position, now that I am not in school and able to work full time, that we no longer need the ccs to bridge the gap between paydays. I also started babysitting and tutoring 12-15 hours a week in addition to my full time job and have made $1000 since October 12th. My husband works at a restaurant when they are short staffed but hasn’t been called in a few months. So we are definitely working to get out of this hole. Additionally, he has 90k in student loans and I have 24k. His will be almost entirely forgiven in 5 years since his dad works for the state and I’m not overly stressed about paying extra on mine, so those are low priority. We just bought a second car outright ($1400) and our current car will be paid off in December. Here’s the break down of our finances:
98k total income before taxes from our full time jobs
$1500 a month in rent (pretty good for a 2 bedroom in NJ)
$600 on groceries a month (we cook all of our meals)
$900 a month toward student loans (both on PAYE plans over 20 years)
$160 a month for car insurance for both cars
Utilities are all on equal payment plans and I have threatened to cancel WiFi several times to get the best deal. 
With all the other miscellaneous bullshit small charges factored in, my spreadsheet spits out that we spend 90% of our take home yearly earnings on necessities. 

I guess my question is, what else can we be doing to get out of cc debt before the 15/18 month intro apr ends? To get all of the cards paid off before interest is charged we would need to be putting $1100 a month toward all of them together which my husband does not believe is doable. I should mention that he is an accountant but I have been doing all of the budgeting and balance transfer research lol. However, he is in charge of keeping our accounts positive and knows more about the day to day money flow than I do. We would like to be able to put a down payment on a house in the next few years before we start having kids but have not quite gotten a handle on that thing you guys call “saving”. Suggestions?

There's one complication. My wife has a 30k personal loan, co-signed by her dad which we do not want to include in the consumer proposal. But the law says we have to. If we do, her dad will have to take over the full payments, and we pay him back (which is fine, we are managing this loan payment currently and the payments wouldn't change).

But my wife doesn't want him involved in this... so we're stuck.

Here are my options as I see it. I'd appreciate some feedback or some other options if I've missed anything.

1. She bites the bullet, let's her dad in on the process, we continue making our payments to him instead of the bank. Proposal goes through, bob's your uncle.

investing,Largest privately owned US coal mining company files for bankruptcy protection,"Ohio-based Murray Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy joining a growing list of bankrupt or struggling miners as utilities switch away from coal.

The company seeks to restructure nearly $3 billion in debt and obtained some $350 million in new loans to continue operating during the bankruptcy proceeding.

Murray Energy was the country's fourth largest coal producer in 2018, accounting for 6% of total production, according to the Energy Information Administration. 

The collapse comes despite federal rescue attempts. The deregulatory push has been unable to offset market forces. Coal has been unable to compete with cheap natural gas and the falling cost of solar power, wind and other forms of renewable energy.

I was thinking that I can just report this income as “miscellaneous income” in my individual federal tax filing next year. Would it be better to register a business and report it as business income?

personalfinance,I got a letter from the GA Department of Revenue saying I owe $700 in back taxes,"Does anyone have experience disputing these claims? 

For this year (2017) I only worked ~6months as it was an internship out of college and I didn’t find another job for ~3months. 

I made ~$28,000 and had very little investment income (&lt;$1000). 

Since this was my first year filing taxes I had my dad help me and we filled out the 1040-EZ for federal and whatever the GA state equivalent is. It’s fairly straightforward paperwork, and I had my dad who has been filing for 40 years to help so I don’t think I did anything wrong. 

My suspicion is that is has something to do with how big of a refund I got (~$3000 state +federal)... because my annualized salary was something like $67,000 I was taxed at a higher rate on each paycheck, but because I only worked about half the year I substantially overpaid in taxes. 

I’m also going to consult my financial advisor, however any additional help would be appreciated.

Edit: To those asking about if the letter says why... they sent me a table with a column of categories (federal AGI, Adjustments, GA AGI, Deductions, etc) and another column of values. I will have to cross reference all the values with my tax documents to find a discrepancy. 

No where does it say “this is the line that’s wrong”

personalfinance,Overwhelmed with Debt and need High Level Guidance on Payoff / Restructure - Have good credit and Income,"Hi there, it's been one hell of a ride to get where I am, but I have found myself in a good deal of debt. Some from stupidity, some from medical bills. We are all healthy now though. I was looking at options to restructure and could use some advice. I am paying many hundreds per month in credit card interest and I was hoping to put the most I can towards principal.

* Credit score is 730
* Savings are only about 5k
* I have 90k in a 401k.
* I just took a new job and discretionary income will be $1,800 after taxes and all budgeted expenses (including minimum payments). I am looking for ways to cut down on expenses as well. (175k Base Salary, 5% in retirement)
* I will be making about 75k bonus per year and the team I am joining has achieved that the last 4 years running. Paid Quarterly. This bonus is not included in the budget numbers above, it is 100% discretionary. This will start in spring of 2020

**Here is the debt breakdown:** [**https://i.imgur.com/g7gbGDY.jpg**](https://i.imgur.com/g7gbGDY.jpg)

Things I could sell that have loans: My boat could be sold and I would gain about 15k, but it's my family's sole passion and we spend hundreds of hours a summer on it so it would be the last thing to go. My car is worth about what the loan is, and after losing a family member recently to a terrible car accident I want my family to be in a car with the most safety features possible. We only need one car as well because I work from home. House is worth 450k but would need updating (carpeting and paint) of about 10k to sell it. I have my college car still that might be worth a few thousand.

I was hoping not to have to sell the house and all the rest of it, but if I ever lose my job it would come to that quickly. I am looking for ideas to put my income to good use paying down debt. I am willing to (and would even post proof) close all my credit card accounts, I don't care about credit score short term. If I can get rid of some of these monthly payments I would have plenty of income for even large unexpected life events. 

Any insight would be great, I am stressed out, anxious, and don't want this weighing on me any more than it has to. I am in my mid thirties and would love to put this money towards a 401k instead. Also, with only $1,800 discretionary per month the unexpected can come up fast. 

**Is there anything I can do besides the avalanche to minimize the interest I am paying? I want as much as possible to go to principal. I am open to home equity loans, personal loans, or even the ""grin and bear it"" approach. Since I have never missed payments and have good credit, I doubt that any of my lenders would lower the CC interest rates.**

I will also look into some of the credit counseling services on here that are listed in the wiki, but I can never tell who is ethical or not in that space and again since my credit is good I don't know that they can help.

 I look forward to hearing any ideas. Now I am off to go do some payoff calculators.",finance

personalfinance,in a financial hole and need some opinions!,"I need some advice on what I should do in my financial situation cause I've dug myself into a deep hole. I've gotten a lot of different opinions and I honestly am not sure which one is the best. Right now I am thinking National Debt Relief but after reading some reviews it sounds like a scam. Here is my situation:

I was on disability for work for the past 2 months and my job only paid 20% of my regular pay which was no where near enough to survive.  The state of California was supposed to pay the rest of my salary. Long story short - My doctor messed up the dates on the form and I've been denied disability. I'm currently in the appeal process. That being said I have been around 90 days behind on bills and I've had to borrow a lot of money from my father to survive which makes me feel awful. I want to be able to pay him back as soon as possible. 

My credit score has dropped to 487. All my cards are maxed out ( I have about 10 with very high interest rates 20-25%) and I cannot afford the minimum payments anymore. I paid my rent with Venmo since they transfer the money to the person before actually taking it out of your bank account ( I know - shady business) so my account is frozen and I owe them $1500.

Altogether I have $49807 in credit card debt (all cards maxed out and overlimit). Two loans - one from my 401k (took out 10k a few years ago but it is almost paid off) and a 11k personal loan.  Over 15k in medical bills I haven't even factored into this.

I have four credit card accounts past due by over 60 days and my credit dropped significantly.  $1600 in rent and I would say $100 for PG&amp;E. My take home is around $5-6k a month. 

I could potentially pull out $25k from my 401k if approved. I've reduced my cost of living to nothing really - just eating and doing free stuff. 

What would you do in this situation?",finance
personalfinance,Advice on how to approach creditors/what to do.,"I am currently way in over my head on credit card debt.

I am currently about to be 2 payments behind on 2 credit cards and 1 payment behind on 2 others and I have no way to pay them until November 9th.

I have a card with Discover, Chase, Amex, Barclays, Best Buy, Capital One and American Eagle. I have a loan with Avant and Personify and I owe some of my 2018 and 2017 taxes, and I have a monthly car payment of $400. So my total debts not including my car are approximately $23,300. It's embarrassing and honestly the interest is eating me alive. I need to get out of this cycle because I am getting buried. They are now somehow calling my home phone so now my parents are prying into everything and it is getting very bad around my household as we don't have the best relationship as it is.

What is my next move? I believe it is to call the ones I am behind on and see what I can do to alleviate the stress since I am so behind. Is this correct?

personalfinance,Trying to plan a future with student loan debt?,"About me:
-27 (F)
-Graduated in 2018 with a doctorate degree in clinical psychology 
-Student loan debt: 115K
-Currently renting an apartment in the Midwest with my new husband (married summer 2019) with one dog and one cat

The situation:
My husband and I have really started to buckle down on our finances since the wedding. After my internship and postdoc and becoming a licensed psychologist, I now can finally search for a job that will help me to pay off this massive debt (I currently work at a nonprofit at 50K and need to leave due to low pay and being overworked). The projection for my area is around $80,000 on average to start, at least. My husband makes about 35K per year, and likely won't be above that until he gets his own business up and running within the next few years. So that places me as the primary earner, as well as the bearer of health insurance. 

Student Loans:
All my student loans are federal and from grad school only (my husband has no student loan debt, yay!) I needed to get on an IBR plan when I started paying them last year. I pay over the required amount per month as I am able to right now ($150 vs. $133 minimum). I could quality for PSLF at my current site but I'm hesitate to stay with a low paying job for the next ten years at the risk of not even qualifying when all is said and done after hearing the horror stories of others trying to quality after the 10 year period.

Monthly Expenses:
-Rent and utilities: $1, 200
-Car payment: $205 (my car, husband's car is paid off)
-Car insurance : $230 (both cars)
-Medical Expenses: $400-600 (I have a chronic health condition and crappy current health insurance with a high deductible plan with current employer)
-Groceries, including pet food: $450 (we limit eating out to 1x per week, 2x per week at most)
-Subscriptions (gym memberships, etc.): $80
-Credit Card Debt: 10K total (I pay 650 per month towards them, which is over the minimum payment and we're paying the most towards the card with the highest amount right now, about 5k). Most credit card debt is leftovers from any wedding expenses, a honeymoon, and money towards my licensure exam

We currently have about 11K saved up to put a down payment on a house and we're hoping to buy next spring, early summer when our lease ends. However, we're struggling to save money towards a house in that timeframe, as my husband wants us to at least put 20K down. Also, we want to try for a child next fall, which comes with more expenses....

A few questions (and please, give any other advice you think would be appropriate!):
1. Should we cut back to just paying the minimum on our credit cards and put that extra money towards a down payment on a house?
2. My husband and I both have credit scores about 730 but I'm the one saddled with the debt, however, I have the longer credit history. How much will this effect our chances of getting a decent mortgage? Should one or both of us be named in the mortgage?
3. I get panicky thinking about my student loans. I did some calculations and I would need to pay 600 per month just to cover accumulating monthly interest 😞 I feel like I'll never pay it off and I'm worried how it's going to affect our house buying potential. Should I reconsider PSLF if I continue to, hopefully, qualify?

I would also love for anyone to share their stories, if any, about starting families or buying houses when in massive debt and how you handled it, both financially and emotionally! I sometimes feel so overwhelmed and disheartened about my personal future and that of my new little family.",finance
personalfinance,I'm fed up with my family and need to move out but have 6 months left on my current lease. Should I move out and pay 2 rents at once and take financial hit for my freedom?

Currently there are 3 family members living in a house (including myself) that we rent for a total of $2800, I pay $1,100 of that each month. The lease ends on May 31st. 

I make $6,000 dollars each month save $3,000 of that. I have a 12 month emergency fund and another $4,000 in a separate ""investing"" account .

personalfinance,When does it make sense to convert to a Roth if you already have money saved?,"Hello, I’m 33 years old, single, and make $130k/year, putting me in the ~24% federal tax bracket and the ~9% tax bracket for California. I’m a pretty good saver; I currently have about $100k in an IRA mostly from a 401(k) rollover, $15k in a Roth IRA and about $30k in a taxable brokerage account. I’ve always done my best to max out all the tax shelters available to me, 401(k), IRA &amp; HSA. I’m currently contributing to a Roth 401(k) through my employer, and always wait for tax season to make my IRA &amp; HSA contributions. 

The end of the year is approaching and I’ve been considering a Roth conversion on a portion of my IRA, maybe $10k - $15k this year and each succeeding year until it’s all converted. 

Right now I like the idea of having flexibility with these funds for future investment opportunities like real estate, (i.e. converting these amounts now into a Roth will make them available for use earlier in the future without incurring a penalty via the 5 year rule.)

I figure that even if I end up not using the funds for other investment opportunities, at the very least they are still in a tax-advantaged account and can be withdrawn tax-free when I reach retirement age. 

I also plan on getting married and having kids in the future. I know that these funds can be used for college while also avoiding the 10% penalty, but to me this seems like a moot point, as I’d still pay taxes on the withdrawal.

I guess I’m struggling with the following:

I tend to take the benefit immediately because you never know what will happen in the future, maybe there will be an opportunity to convert these funds at a much lower tax rate due to changes in my employment status (i.e. jobless or self employed,) income, or tax deductions.

Vs.

By converting now, I’m giving myself flexibility in the future while also keeping these funds sheltered in a tax advantaged account. I just have to pay the tax in my current bracket right now.

TL;DR - Broken down my expenses and income (first time working with an absolute fixed income), and I'm feeling some pressure with student loans about to enter repayment. I'm looking for feedback/tips/tools to lessen the financial stress in my life, without living too ""broke"".

# Background:

23M, just graduated college with my Master's degree and took a position on the opposite side of the country from where I grew up. In a long-distance relationship, I'd like to get back to visit or pay for her to visit me every \~6-8 weeks at the minimum. Student loans entering repayment soon. Student loan principal \~$86K. CC Debt \~$3K (down from $5K since moving 3 months ago!). Auto loan \~$9K. Personal family loan $500. Furniture line-of-credit \~$1400. I've built up a small emergency fund (\~$1K), with a goal of getting it to $5K.

$83,500 Base Salary, fixed, no OT. Recently received a $5000 lump-sum moving bonus (post-taxes). Long story short, I didn't budget this well, so I had to basically max out my CC during the move. Contributing combined 10% to 401k between Trad/Roth.  Main work location is in BFE, 47 mile commute one way, so I vanpool \~6/9 (*nice*) days per pay period. One day I work remote, one day I work at a different facility, and one fluff day (I snooze...).

Relatively LCOL area, housing options limited due to living with a restricted-breed (Husky) per the state regulations. Rent ""$925"", with a *mandatory $110 entertainment package,* $35 in pet rent, $95 in utilities (water, sewer, trash, security camera, parking) - bringing the total for the expense I'm calling ""rent"" to $1200 (leaving some contingency for stupid service/notice/processing/BS fees).

I'm a YNABer - dropped the money for the annual subscription and love it so far. If anyone has any tips or uses YNAB like a pro - PM me.

# Dilemma

With this breakdown, I'm left with a margin of \~$250 at the end of the month for paying down excess debt once my loans enter repayment, not including extraneous cash spending like eating out, entertainment, gaming, etc...

I think with these assumptions, I have more money in my budget than shown because of the bi-weekly pay =/= 2 paychecks/mo. necessarily. I'd like to think of these two unaccounted for paychecks in my budget as rainy day/travel/excess EFund surprises. Also, I've elected to claim 0 deductions, which should leave me a pretty nice refund come tax season. Any thoughts/tips on how to decrease spending in the short-term (\~2-6 mo.) so I can pay-down my below debts ASAP while still having a decent work-life balance? I've considered:

* Switching to an income-driven repayment plan to lower the minimum payments, so I can pay my higher-interest loans /debts more quickly
* Dropping my 401k contributions to the minimum total required to max company match (8%) \~$60 extra
* Claiming 1 deduction for a few paychecks until CC debt is paid off, then returning to 0

personalfinance,drowning in student loans... looking for any advice on how to pay them off,"Hello all, I appreciate you in advance for reading this lengthy post about my current struggle with my student loans. I've never posted here before so please ask for more information if I haven't provided enough.

Intro: I'm a 22F that just graduated college in May of 2019 and am currently in my gap year before medical school. If I don't get accepted this cycle, I will be taking a second gap year.

Loans: Sallie Mae = 114k Discover = 48k Federal = 30k Wells Fargo = 9k

I currently have a steady job working full time making $20/hr. As of recently, I've began budgeting and setting aside more money for savings, student loan payments, and a Roth IRA.

I haven't paid toward any of my student loans so far and they are deferred until November in which I have to start paying about $1400+ a month (at a minimum). I obviously cannot afford that and since most of my loans are private, they don't do income-based repayment.

Should I apply for forbearance in order to defer it until I start going to medical school where it will be deferred since I'll be a student again? Should I start paying them, if yes, how? Honestly just looking for any advice that can help me out. Thank you!!

EDIT: I'm getting a lot of ""why did you go to an expensive school""? Ok yes, obviously I was stupid and made a horrible mistake but that's not going to help me with paying off my current debt, so please only give me actually useful advice.
EDIT 2: I'm really just looking for advice on potential repayment options.",finance
personalfinance,Question about taking money out of a mutual fund,"I apologize in advanced if this post and question doesn't have sufficient information. But, I am considering taking some money out of an index mutual fund that I've had for about 5 years. I've been somewhat consistently adding money to this fund throughout the past few years. However, I need to take some of it out to help pay for some bills.

My questions are, how will this affect my taxes/tax return for next year? Does the amount that I take out affect how my tax return is affected? Or, can I just freely take from this fund without much consequence because it's kind of my money anyways?

I am single, and in a low federal tax bracket if this helps.

Jerome Powell may be getting ready to pause this year’s monetary easing campaign.


The Federal Reserve chairman and his colleagues are expected to cut interest rates a quarter point on Wednesday for a third straight meeting, to provide insurance against global risks, while signaling that the committee has probably done enough for now. The decision will be announced at 2 p.m. in Washington with Powell facing reporters 30 minutes later.

Key Speakers At The NABE Annual Meeting
Jerome PowellPhotographer: Daniel Brenner/Bloomberg
Investors are fully pricing a cut, with the odds increasing to 97% after Commerce Department data showed gross domestic product increasing at a better than expected 1.9% annualized pace in the third quarter, as resilience from U.S. consumers offset weakening business investment and faltering export markets.

U.S. Economy Holds Up With 1.9% Growth on Consumer Strength


Economists surveyed by Bloomberg put the odds of a cut at 75%, betraying a bit more doubt that reflects divisions on the committee about the need to lower borrowing costs much further. While policy makers all see risks from trade uncertainty and weakness abroad, some view the Fed’s reductions in July and September as already sufficient to offset those headwinds absent additional shocks.

FOMC seen cutting rates a quarter point then pausing
Greenspan Approach
Powell will likely use his press conference to communicate that message of a pause while emphasizing flexibility if the economic outlook shifts significantly.

“What they want to provide is a hawkish cut,’’ said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago and a former Fed researcher. “Expressing that properly will require some deft expression, which the Fed hasn’t always been able to provide.’’


Powell is following the playbook of a mentor, Alan Greenspan, who cut rates three times in midcycle adjustments in 1995-1996 and in 1998 to counter risks. September forecasts showed the FOMC saw interest rates hitting bottom this year before rising slightly in 2021.

Investors are slightly more dovish and have fully priced in another quarter point cut by mid-2020. The Fed will update its quarterly forecasts in December.

What Bloomberg Economists Say
“Bloomberg Economics expects officials to adopt a “meeting-by-meeting” approach to evaluating the need for additional stimulus, so as to appease hawkish-leaning members of the committee. However, from meeting-to-meeting in a slow growth, low inflation environment, officials will see greater need to provide additional support.”

-- Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger 

The FOMC is divided between policy makers who favor insurance against risks from a manufacturing slump, the trade war with China, Brexit and slower global growth, versus those who see domestic data largely supporting their outlook for solid growth.

Likely Dissents

The latter camp includes Kansas City Fed’s Esther George and Boston’s Eric Rosengren, both likely to dissent again if the Fed cuts rates on Wednesday. They have some company: The Fed’s September dot plot of interest rate projections showed five officials didn’t favor the cut delivered at that meeting and another five who saw no need for another cut this year.

That creates the possibility of a surprise, and economists put 20% odds that the FOMC will decide not to cut Wednesday. Any pause would also certainly be opposed by President Donald Trump, who’s pushed publicly for lower rates to rev up the economy.

Prediction: Quarter-Point Cut
“This meeting will be very contentious,’’ said Jonathan Wright, economics professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who previously worked at the Fed. “The overall data since the last meeting aren’t that negative, and a lot of FOMC participants, mostly nonvoting, will be unconvinced of the wisdom of cutting again.’’

Done Enough?

The last time the Fed reduced rates three times while the economy was growing was in 1998. After the third cut, it sent a strong signal it was done, announcing that financial conditions following 75 basis points of easing “can reasonably be expected” to sustain the expansion.

Wednesday’s statement might also suggest “we have done enough,’’ said Stephen Stanley, Amherst Pierpont chief economist. “If they ease and want to send a pause signal, it will be up to Powell to flesh it out.’’

FOMC may tweak wording on expected inflation
The FOMC may consider tweaking its assessment of current conditions to slightly weaker wording, noting that the job creation has eased and inflation expectations have moderated, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist with Stifel Nicolaus in Chicago.


One concern Fed officials may have with too strong of a pause signal is that it could flatten the Treasury yield curve, and an inverted yield curve -- where short term rates are higher than long-term ones -- is traditionally viewed as a recession warning that could alarm investors.

Fed Resolve
“The market is likely to increasingly question the Fed’s resolve to prop up a faltering economy which could translate into lower rates on the longer end, perpetuating the need for further Fed action to stabilize the shape of the yield curve,’’ she said.

The central bank was not seen making much news on its balance sheet following an Oct. 11 announcement it would buy Treasury bills at an initial $60 billion a month pace to lift bank reserves in the system. The Fed has repeatedly called the measure, undertaken after sharp spikes in overnight money market rates, a technical step that did not alter the stance of monetary policy.",finance
solar,Please help me with new construction decisions!,"Hi all,   
   
I've been reading a lot on the forum and wanted to get your opinions and help.  My wife and I are in the framing stage of a new home and are strongly considering solar.  I have no idea what our monthly power usage will be since we haven't lived there but here is some info on the house:

&amp;#x200B;

\-In SC (additional 25% state tax credit on top of federal)

\-Large southern facing roofline with my first quote also quoting panels on east southeast roofline (pics to follow)

\-It is \~5200sqft house.  We are on a lake and will be taking water out of the lake and filtering for residential use so that will have to be powered.  We will also have a pump that pumps water out of the lake directly for irrigation/yard uses; 

\-We will have a pool with a heat pump (which can be turned on and off as needed/wanted. I did see some info on heating with your AC exhaust?)

\-Electric heat pumps for house. 2 natural gas fireplaces; natural gas range; pretty much everything else electric

\-Considering a hybrid or electric tankless water heater, but not really sure I understand pros vs. cons of this versus a gas one.

\-No electric cars as of yet, but having builder place a charger outlet in all garage bays as we will likely have one in future

\-Blown insulation in all roofline/attic areas; traditional insulation on all sides (2x6 exterior so R20 insulation here)

\-We have plans for a natural gas generator that would be enough to work essential lights, our water pump/filtration, and refrigeration.  I would consider a powerwall or some equivalent but they seem to be much more expensive. 

\-I'm estimating that our monthly power bill would be somewhere between $300 and $400/month

\-The quote I like the best so far is for a 19.9kw system with 61 SunPower SPR-E20-327 panels. Cost quoted after tax incentives would be $27,625

&amp;#x200B;

What else should I be considering? 

Our power company does net metering and you settle up at the end of the year I believe. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I looked at the new Tesla solar roof as the one big turnoff my wife has about the traditional is 'how the panels look' which doesn't bother me but is eliminated with Tesla; Problem is from what I can tell it would be significantly more expensive and the power company still limits all residential systems at 20kw. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text but I really appreciate everyone's help/guidance.",energy
personalfinance,Should I Add More Allowances to my W-4?,"Not sure if this belongs here, but definitely hoping to get some more info on how federal tax allowances work, and if I should add more to my W4.

I have a normal 9-5 salary job, with a monthly paycheck. I currently have 1 allowance listed on my W4 for federal withholding, and tend to get a 1-3k total refund each year. I'm single, no dependents, and I do not own my home. 

Recently I stumbled across a tax withholding calculator on the IRS site. After running my numbers through it (and then double checking against the TurboTax version) it says that I could add 6-7 allowances to my paycheck and only owe $900-1200 come tax time. However, I would be getting &gt;$400 per paycheck. Over 12 paychecks that definitely sounds like the better deal to me, even after taking out the amount I'd normally get for a refund. 

Oddly enough I cant seem to find definitive proof anywhere that I can actually add allowances to my W4. Everywhere makes it sound like I would have to be married, have a mortgage, or have dependents to do this. Is that true, and am I stuck with my single allowance? Or is it not advisable to add in extra even though I'd much rather have the monthly take home pay over a so-so refund come next Spring?",finance

Forex,Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.,"I had this strategy where I trade only Interest rate news on the major currency pairs. Here's how it worked: 

Entry: enter a buy stop and a sell stop (pending orders) 5-10 pips away from the currency price about 1 minute before the interest rate news is released. 

Whats supposed to happen: the price either shoots up or shoots down, activating one of the pending orders. Usually, I noticed I got 15 to 60 pips in a minute. Take your profit out after a minute just to be safe. Secure those pips. 

Example of entry: gold price= 1500. I would enter a buy stop at 1501 and a sell stop at 1499. 

Teoretically speaking, this strategy sounded amazing to me. There's no way I can lose. 

What happened when testing on 3000$ Demo account: the maximum lot size I could possibly place was 24 on gold with that demo account. So, I place a 24 lot buy stop and 24 lot sell stop 1 minute before interest rate news is released. When the news releases, in a few seconds one of the orders are activated, and in profit by 8000$. Tested this a few more times and it worked. Made $30,000,000!!!!!

WHAT HAPPENED ON A REAL ACCOUNT: I'm excited. Time to make that real $30,000,000. Every time I try this strategy, it never works. Example: 

CADJPY was at 83.210 when interest rate news was released today. Price dropped. I had a pending buy order at 83.300 and pending sell order at 83.160. sell was activated, I got a much lower price than what I placed (around 83.000) and just as price hits this, it shoots up until I get stopped out, and then the price dropped to 82.880. This scenario happened about 5 times. It never worked on a real account, even though I used slammer lot sizes than demo, while using the same leverage. I don't understand. Shouldn't it work? 

I always get the wrong price, and just as I do get the wrong price, it goes the other way until I am stopped out.  And just as I get stopped out, literally JUST as I get stopped out, the price goes in my favour. I tried 3 different brokers, and the same scenario happened every time

personalfinance,Thoughts on using my retirement money for surgery??,"Okay guys, complete newbie here so please go easy on me. Need advice and everyone I know IRL is terrible with money, so…

I make $35k/yr in a low cost of living area, so I’ve been saving up about $500/month. I have a bachelor’s. I live in the United States. I have about $30k in student loan debt, with okay interest rate (\~4-5%). I am on track to have it forgiven through the PSLF program since my employment qualifies, although I’m aware that program has a ridiculously low approval rate so I’m not banking on it 100%. I am 27 years old. I contribute to a retirement account pre-tax so it gets taken out of my paycheck before I even see it. I’m not even keeping track of that money. I believe my employer’s company that handles the retirement is investing it. I’m very ignorant about investing so I figured I would let them handle it. I work for a large university so it’s legit and I doubt it’s being misused at all. I contributed the max percentage my employer would provide a match for and set it/forget it.

Right now I have $7,500 saved up in my savings. I know technically I’m losing money by not investing it, but I’m very risk-averse and as I said very ignorant about how to invest, and I’ve watched my parents burn huge amounts of money so I decided to just hold onto it now for whatever, since I was trying to decide what I want to do next. I think my next plan is I want to go to grad school. I have tuition benefits from the university and I think roughly a master’s degree will cost 2-3k per year for me, I will not have to take out more loans, and I will continue to work full time while taking classes part time. My savings should provide some good wiggle room for that, right?

Here’s what my question is about. I’m sorry for being crude, but I have very large breasts, like ridiculously large. Exercising is difficult. At 27 years old, I’m already having back pain and I’m already in almost constant discomfort. My mother has extremely bad back pain and has had to go to a chiropractor her whole life, and I can see myself going down that road and I am absolutely dreading it. I also have no way to prove this but I feel like the weight is also causing breathing issues that may be affecting my sleep. I want to have breast reduction surgery before grad school, because I’m almost positive working, studying, and just existing will be so much easier without them. It borders on body dysphoria.

Breast reduction surgery costs $10,000 and it’s looking more and more like my insurance plan won’t cover it. And I know, from a financial standpoint, of course the frugal answer is to just power through and do without, but it’s affecting my quality of life. Everyone I’ve talked to about it raves about how happy they are that they had it done. Obviously it’s up to me to weigh the pros and cons, but I am considering just paying for it out of pocket.

Here’s the thing, I THOUGHT that I would have to drain my savings and put off grad school to do so. Then I remembered my employer-contributed retirement plan. Like I said it was a set it and forget it way to save money and I wasn’t even paying attention to it. Then I checked it and my account balance is FREAKING $25,000!  I am honestly shaking a little. I have NEVER had this much money before, not even close. Obviously I do not want to waste this. So my questions are as follows:

\#1 Do you think it would be prudent, or at the very least not overly foolish, to withdraw some of that money early to pay for this surgery so I can start grad school right away after it? True it would give me more money to leave it until I retire, but I have issues affecting my life NOW, and what’s the point of living only for retirement if you’re going to be miserable for 50 years until then??  My only debt is my student loans and I am usually pretty frugal and have cheap hobbies.

\#2 What are the penalties for early withdrawal, usually, from retirement accounts? It looks like half of my money is in a 401(A) and the other half is in a 403(B). I have no idea what those numbers mean.  I imagine I will have to pay some sort of penalty for taking it out early, plus taxes and fees and things. I live in Pennsylvania if that makes any difference.  I plan to call them to ask what the penalty might look like but I want an idea of what to expect.

Any perspective or info is appreciated. I need some advice from people older and wiser than me lol. If you are a woman especially I would probably like very much to hear from you.  Thank you in advance.

EDIT: just got off the phone.  The specifics of my plan is that I am not allowed to do an in-service withdrawal, but I can take out a loan against my savings and the interest goes back into the savings. So what I'm thinking is I could just take the loan and then in the future, reduce my retirement contribution and put that money into the loan instead",finance
personalfinance,Overpayment by former employer,"Hi all,

I recently left my former employer after five years. As I started my new gig and had moving expenses, etc., I noticed I had two deposits totaling a little over $2k from said employer, but didn’t think of anything as I was owed vacation payout, bonuses, etc. 

It turns out that the $2k was in addition to what I expected, and an overpayment. They sent me a letter requesting a check for the amount, and I replied back asking about any tax consequences, etc., and got what I thought was a strange reply:

“As of right now no taxable income has been added to his income. So taxes have not been effected. If he doesn’t pay back the funds then we will have to add it to his income and take all Medicare/SS tax liability from his federal taxes paid YTD. Any additional federal tax that he may owe he’ll have to take care of when he files his taxes.”

...it’s almost as though it was written from someone else to the HR contact for them to decipher to me. Perhaps I wasn’t supposed to see this? Can anyone decode? I know they can legally recoup the money, just wanted to if there was any indication in this language that says they might not chase it hard - mostly don’t understand the Medicare/SS tax liability deal.

personalfinance,"Helping to understand my current student loans, and best avenue to refinance if that's even an option.","Hello, all.

Long time lurker.

Firstly, I'd like to just get it out there that I know VERY little about the loan system and how it works. I understand the standard APR calculation, but as of reading other posts similar to this, I'm learning about a lot of new intricacies of individual loans.

It's all quite intimidating.

I'm 28, live with my best mate in California, making $2,300 net a month, myself. We split $1,455 in rent between the two of us (I moved as close as I could to work to reduce gas cost).

After all expenditures (bearing in mind that our rent JUST increased from $1,375 to $1,455), I'm netting MAYBE $200 a month IF I don't spend a lick of anything that ISN'T a mandatory bill. As you might imagine, more often than not, that ends up being close to, if not outright, zero.

I currently have two loans, both from my college which is a Trade School (private or public, I don't know, nor do I know what defines them as such).

My first loan is 6 groups, consolidated in a single loan of $12,921.47 as of today. With each group having their own interest rate of around 4.2% average, my loan comes out to a total of 25.42% interest rate.

My monthly payments to this loan are minimum $149.42, but I do $150. Despite paying the same amount every month, the amount put towards my principle seems to fluctuate between $2 and $8, which confuses me. This is where the intricacies of the individuals loans may come in, that of which I'm unaware of how it works.

Doing the math on my last payment, however, with $44.92 being applied to interest, it seems that my real interest rate is basically the predatory limit at 29.94%. How that works, I don't know.

My second loan is $3,474.65, also from my school as far as I can tell, with a monthly payment of about $176. It's fluctuating every other month though, but in general I'm paying $20 more than what's requested.

It SAYS the following:

* Maximum Interest Rate: 7.00%
* Current Interest Rate: 7.00%

But doing the math on each payment, it's actually around 10% to 11%.

Obviously, I'm barely touching these things, and it's unfortunate because I had better plans for myself than what I'm doing right now, but roll with the punches?

When I got my new job about a year and a half ago, I had a plan to pay off my student loans in about two years because I lived with Mom. Through a... situation that Mom was involved in getting us kicked out two months later (/r/raisedbynarcissists worthy), I was forced into finding a home for myself with a roommate. I say forced, when really I wasn't, but I refuse to live with her anymore because it's not good for my mental health. I was very close to putting a bullet in my head on a few occasions. Mom and I aren't friends in any regard.

I'm not sure what re-financing means for me, or if it's even an OPTION for me. I have a credit score of 753 (and rising), and it's really the only thing of tangible fiscal value I have despite it being a stupid number. I just know higher means better and that it allows me to do adult things.

If there's any help anyone would be willing to provide in regards to re-financing or some pointers on where to go, I'd appreciate it. Even at the very least, some insight into why my PAID interest seems to differ from my LISTED interest.

**EDIT**: Currently in the process of getting a raise (as a contractor). The company I work for just lost a LOT of senior members, and I'm one of the remaining few. Through taking advantage of the leverage, I requested $22 but I may be getting a bump from $17.50 to above $20+, in any case.",finance

We can either refinance the balance now to 4.875% variable rate or take out a one year fixed rate at 2.79% and then have it jump up after a year to 4.875% variable rate.

We’ve had the HELOC open for about 5 years, if that matters.

None of the refinancing would cost us anything.

personalfinance,(AUS) Need some advice on opening an offset account against my PPR in Australia.,"My current home loan is $350,000. Property value sits around $400,000. 
This is not our forever home and we bought to get on the ladder. We would like to buy our next ""forever"" home in the next 4 years and rent out my current home. 
Current interest rate is 3.23% on a standard home loan, no offset with Bank SA.
Current savings for me and my partner sits around $45,000 which currently earns us around $500 in interest a year in an online Rams saver account. That goes up around $20,000 a year with a goal of reaching $100,000 by 2022. 

I spoke with my mortgage broker and he came up with the following change in home loan to add an offset: 
Bank SA, 3.28% interest (0.05%) higher with an annual fee of $395. With $45k in the offset that should work out to an annual saving of $905pa, I think. 

Everyone tells me to get an offset but am I getting ahead of myself?
I feel once I add on the annual fees and take into consideration, I won’t be making any interest on that 45k, I will actually be costing myself money on my current situation.
Or can anyone recommend a better home loan that I should look into. I would love to have multiple offset accounts but they seem to have higher interest rates. If we add all our money in all accounts it would sit around $50k.

The interest rate on the line of credit is 16% and I was paying $1000 per month but felt like I was never going to pay it off. 
I did some research and realized my interest rate is high so I called my bank to negotiate. They suggested a loan with a 5 year payment plan at 9% interest. My monthly payments are $580 a month and I'm hoping to double that each month and pay the loan off quicker. 
The payments include job loss, life and disability insurance which costs me about $30 per month or $4 for every $100. 

Did I do the right thing? I am able to opt out of the insurance and save up to $1800 in the 5 years but it seemed like the right thing to do as I don't have much in savings to fall back on if I lose my job.

personalfinance,Best place to keep a short-term/5-year fund after the latest Fed rate cut today?,"Currently, I have been keeping my money in a few different places:

10+ year fund - Roth IRA, 401k

5-10 year fund - taxable brokerage accounts (Vanguard for ETFs/index funds, Robinhood for individual stocks)

5 year fund - Wealthfront HYSA earning 2.07%

With the latest Fed rate cut today, I am expecting Wealthfront's cash management account rate to go down to 1.82% in the next few days.  With inflation at 1.7% that would still give a (barely) positive real return for the time being.  The money in the Wealthfront account is low-risk money that I plan for a down-payment on a house in several years, and I don't really want to put it in the market.

I am wondering if anyone has any advice or suggestions.  Should I look into Series I savings bonds?  My understanding is that they are indexed to inflation, but when I look at the rates for those, for TIPS, and for short-term treasuries the rates are all below inflation.  I'm willing to have that money lose a little bit of purchasing power in the short-term but don't really want to if I don't need to.",finance

As I mentioned the car payment is high and I would like to get some input on whether it’s unreasonably high that I need to sell it or doable on the long run. Since I bought it used it was for about 60% of the new MSRP, it will definitely depreciate by the time I sell it but I don’t think the depreciation would be terrible (probably very biased here). I would like to like to know if I need to change my lifestyle and if so what are the options. I essentially would like to create a budget since currently I am just tracking while trying to optimize as best as I can. I am also not sure if I am making reasonable savings.

For some reason the student loans are a significant mental burden for me even though their interest rate is not that high, so I was thinking about putting some of the 18k savings towards these loans. I am not really sure how much, according to the side bar here I should have at least 3 months of emergency fund, given that math that means putting only 3k towards the loans. I am not also sure what is a good goal to get them paid off along with the car loan.

As you can see, I have no idea what I am doing so any help would be really appreciated!

Edit: Main questions I am asking (copied from comment below)

• How much should be spent on student loans and when should I pay them off?

• Same question for car loan.

• Are these expenses/savings reasonable.",finance

Bitcoin,Mycelium — family scam,"I  recently read a Tom Weider article about Mycelium, and in it I saw a  curious detail. In addition to the main company Mycelium, there are  companies with the same name in different countries that are not  branches of the company of Alexander Kuzmin, but perform their function.  Today I rummaged a bit and found out some information.

Partners  of Alexander Kuzmin come to the country, find fake founders and  directors. Next, create a legal entity, registering it for such persons.  Such a company conducts business in the country, create an advertising  campaign, and maintains financial reporting, however, as soon as the  first reports come that someone was left without a cryptocurrency,  company employees “disappear” from the radar, their email becomes  invalid, all resources are deleted contact details etc. In just one day,  no one remains in the company, and all responsible persons have already  left the country. All core employees are hired by outsourcing, and  therefore can live on another continent.

For  example, Ekaterina Kuzmina is a person with significant control in  MYCELIUM TECHNOLOGIES LTD. This company has existed since 03.12.2018 and  is registered in the UK under Company No 11250856. Based on data from  LLC resources in the UK, this company has no website, no email, or any  other active contacts. Its only task is to be a cover for the activities  of Alexander Kuzmin, a tail that the lizard will throw off in order to  run away from a predator.

MYCELIUM  TECHNOLOGIES LTD, as I said before, is not the only such company. In  the Russian Federation, the birthplace of Alexander Kuzmin, another  similar company is registered — LLC Maysilium Rusha, the founder of  which is Kuzmin himself, and the director is Zulfar Khusainov. The  register of companies in the Russian Federation indicates quite a huge  list of types of activities the company is engaged in — from advisory  work in the field of computer technology and computer systems management  activities to the repair of household appliances, home and garden  tools. Total — more than 20 activities.

Zulfar  himself began his IT career from his personal business, as an  individual entrepreneur, specializing in hosiery retail in Perm. It is  not known how socks, tights and cryptocurrency are connected, but since  2016, just when the Russian division of the Bitcoin wallet Mycelium was  opened, it was he who took the post of CEO. Obviously, this person  cannot take any decisions in the company and has no weight at all.

From  all of the above, we can conclude that Kuzmin’s activities are limited  not only to the theft of money from the accounts of their users; it may  well include commercial espionage too. I mean complex espionage. Any  intervention in the company’s computer systems opens access to its  corporate information, servers with a database of employees,  documentation, and so on. Such data can be used for extortionate  purposes, it can be sold or simply stolen and reserved until the right  moment.

Therefore,  for the umpteenth time, I tell all of you — check your counterparties,  check their companies, do not take information from the counterparty (it  could be falsified), make official inquiries to banks about the  solvency of the company, request information from public registries, do  not be stingy. Because you will spend no more than $ 100 on such a  check, but you can lose hundreds of times more without such expertise.

Plan is to do this for 1 year and hop back in at the year mark from this point.  Part of me is telling myself to stay the course as i have thought things would drop for past 3 years or so.  I actually did pull out for a short time and it worked out well (i would say mostly luck).  But my current though process is as follows.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Worst case is i pull out for a year and lose say 10-15% gain. Yes this sucks but i'm ok with the item in mind below

Best case is i pull out for a year, things drop and i buy back in at a huge discount.  Problem here is i am sure i will be concerned about when to buy back in so it's important i stick to my 1 year timeline and don't try to time that part.

 \* Absolute worst case - I continually do this with my money for longer than a year and lose on 10-15% gains over multiple years due to trying to continuously time the market...

I was hoping the loan would show up like a signature loan on my credit report, but not sure since they pay the creditors directly and require the accounts be closed afterward. I understand my credit will take a hit due to some of my oldest accounts being closed as well. Can anyone help explain what the impacts might be and for how long they would last?

HODL is a meme and we have people selling their bags left and right.  Seriously, the BAKKT desk had low volume on day one... so everyone sells!?  What has happened to our culture??  To our commitment to this project and vision?  The fundamentals of BTC didn't change.  HODL has dissolved.

Newcomers come to this sub and don't get the passion, idea, game plan, and behavior of HODL anymore.  We need to return to our roots.  We need to reignite our commitment to HODL.  We are all passionate about the promise BTC offers.  Lets be clear on how we can action our passion.  Let us be clear on how new comers can action their passion.  HODL is an action.  

Happy birthday Bitcoin.  Thank you for showing us that there is a way through darkness.  For too long have the old institutions held back the progress and potential of an evolved and united world.  Happy birthday and thank you so so much.

personalfinance,Looking for feedback on budget for family of 3 (primarily single income household),"Hey everyone, just looking for some feedback on my budget and financial goals for a family of 3 after recently updating the budget. It's been helpful in the past to ask here and see if anything stands out to anyone. Other relevant information is detailed below the tables.

**Monthly Expenses**|**Amount**
:--|:--
Mortgage (PITI &amp; HOA)|$1,470
Groceries / Toiletries|$400
Gas|$80
Auto Insurance|$95
Health Insurance|$480
Dental Insurance|$65
Life Insurance|$14
Internet|$40
Cell Phones|$6
Subscriptions|$27
Utilities|$200
Fun / Eating Out|$100
Toddler|$50
Charity|$100
Taxes|$770
Other|$350
Health Savings Account|$110
Roth IRA|$1,000
Roth 401(k)|$430
**TOTAL**|**$5,787**

**Monthly Income**|**Amount**
:--|:--
Salary|$6,090
Side Job|$300
**TOTAL**|**$6,390**

**MONTHLY BALANCE:** $6,390 - $5,787 = $603

**Other:**

* My wife and I are both in our late 20s and our son is 4 years old

* Medium cost of living of area

* Income is supplemented by ~$300 to 400 per month from a side job my wife does


* Monthly income from salary in the table excludes annual bonus (ranges from $4k to $7k depending on the year)

* 7% being contributed to Roth 401(k), with 3% match from employer

* Roth IRA category is $1k per month to max out each of our accounts

* The ""Other"" category in the monthly expense table is a catchall for household items, repairs/work, unexpected auto expenses, clothing, haircuts, etc. We always try to be frugal, so we're not just spending to reach the limit on that category every month. We're usually below, but sometimes over if there are unexpected auto expenses, etc.

* Any other relevant information that would be useful?

**Assets:**

* Retirement accounts: $65,000

* Liquid savings in online accounts: $30,000

* House: We put 20% down (~$65,000) last year for a 30-year mortgage on a new-build and refinanced last month (dropped our interest rate from 4.5% to 3.625%!)

* We own two vehicles (one might need replacing within the next few years or so)

**Questions:**

* *529 account:* We are currently not contributing directly into a 529 account for our toddler, but my parents gave us $1k when he was born to start one and they contribute $600 per year to it (so it's had about $3,400 put into the account; it's grown some, of course). In addition to that money from my parents, we were thinking of just pulling from each of our Roth IRA accounts to help him out with the cost for school up to some set dollar limit (currently undecided, but probably based on state universities expense amounts). Would it be better to just contribute directly to the 529 account?

* *Vacations / Fun:* We have some of the liquid savings earmarked for a 10-year anniversary trip, but other trips or activities (like concerts or other dates) don't really clearly show up in our budget (aside from falling into the Other or Fun category). It would probably be good to work that in and categorize out the liquid savings in a more organized manner.

* *Long-term financial goals:* not really sure. We may or may not have one more kid, but I don't think that will impact the finances much besides increasing certain categories. At some point we'll move, but not sure when. I don't see us getting into the rental house business, so we'd likely sell and buy a new house at the same time whenever that happens. No current plans for that at all. I've tossed around the idea of upping retirement contributions even more (currently at about 23.5% of salary, plus the 3% employer match) to maybe be able to retire a little early. Any other thoughts as far as financial goals? The monthly balance is currently just going into our liquid savings each month and helping that grow.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

I have one personal loan, $15,812 left on it, **fixed minimum payment of $752** (regardless of balance), interest rate **16%**. So - I have to pay off the **whole thing** to get rid of that $752 a month payment.  Also, I can't ""add"" anything to that loan (ie, I can't transfer a balance).

I also have $20,248 in variable minimum payment but higher-interest credit cards:

* **$7,345** at **21.99%** (two cards, minimum payment of $219 on the $6,255 balance and minimum payment of **?** because I just paid one of the two cards down to $1,090 and don’t know its new minimum payment amount); and
* **$12,902** at **17.24%** (minimum payment $318).

&amp;#x200B;

Should I pay off the higher-interest debt first? Or should I pay off the fixed debt so that I have higher cashflow to pay down the others?

&amp;#x200B;

FWIW, I also have debt at:

* 13.24% ($9,997 with payment of $188)
* 0% (for now, $9,451 with $142 payments)

personalfinance,Is a student loan my only option?,"So I'm planning on studying in the UK next year. I already got offers from 2 universities and the only thing that is bugging me is my financial problem. Let me explain, my parents don't support my decision and want me to study in my country so I can be close to them. (they are being overprotective here). But anyway I already applied and I don't regret it a tiny bit. There's already a student loan in the UK that covers your university fee, 9250£  per year, but I don't have to pay it until I finish uni and find a job with a minimum salary of 25000£. I'm pretty sure that I'll use this loan. The problem is the accommodation, I'll need at least 4500£ to pay it which impossible for my family, although I never intended to ask them for the money. I'm not sure about the conditions but I'm guessing that I will have to pay for the accommodation loan during my studies. It has a 7% interest rate which I don't really know if it's a lot. So do you think it's worth to get this loan or are there any other options out there? Even if I work part-time I'll still be far from having this much money.

personalfinance,How can I shift my career in finance to a more impactful role?,"Not sure if this is the best place to post this. 
Basically, I’m currently working at a large consumer finance company (loans). I got hired on as a branch manager trainee which was big for me considering my last position was as a bank teller.
I’ve been able to acquire valuable skills and learn so much in my short time here, but I still don’t feel that sense of pride in my work. And I just found out that the senior management team is soliciting our state legislators to RAISE INTEREST RATES! They are already high as it is and this just really doesn’t sit well with me.  As bad as it sounds, I don’t want my company to succeed in that. 

I guess the best case of action would be to possibly write to our legislators? 
Has anyone else felt anything like this before when their company made a decision similar to this? 
I genuinely believe in helping people, and I don’t see this positively affecting our customers at all. 

TL:DR; work at a loan company, found out they’re trying to raise the interest rates by soliciting state legislators, doesn’t feel right with me.",finance

It's set to be around $200,000 and current interest rate will be between 6-7% (refinancing to a slightly lower rate should be an option). Without extending the loan term (10 years), we will be looking at a monthly payment of around $2,500 per month. Our combined pre-tax income will be around $100,000 per year. We can afford that payment. Currently, I put $300 per month or so into a Roth IRA. That is the only form of retirement saving we have, as she will not have retirement benefits for her three years of residency and my job does not offer any programs. Ultimately, my question is, should I continue saving via the IRA or try and use every available dollar to pay down the student debt?

Any thoughts, opinions, and viewpoints are welcome. I'm trying to wrap my head around the different options available. I would be happy to provide more information if someone is curious. If formatting is awful, I apologize. I do not post often at all.

Hi all, this month is the first month in a long where I've been able to pay off all my credit cards and bills and have some savings left over, so I decided to make a budget and seek out some feedback on it.

I am 25 years old, finishing graduate school and working full-time. My current income is approx. $51,000/year. Before my take home pay my health insurance is $120/month, and I contribute 8% of my income to my 401k which is matched by my company. I'm in NYS and have the highest rate taken out of my taxes, and tend not budget my tax refund until I get it. Typically it's in the $2k range, and I split this between savings, directed student loan payments, and spending a couple hundred on myself. The average expenses per month is based off the average I've spent in the last 10 months (thanks, Mint!), so it's pretty close to accurate. The car insurance is based on my bi-annual payments, averaged over the month, same with my credit card annual fees (2 cards). I do not have a car loan, or any credit card debt beyond month to month expenses. 

My rent is high, but I have a very nice apartment with all utilities included. Having a roommate is what allows me to save again, and that's why the budget ends in May, when the academic year is over and he moves out and I will have to rebudget. 

My 401k is currently sitting at about $10k, but with how variable the interest rate is I try to only think about it as my contribution in the short-term.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated, as I'm just getting back into budgeting and planning my finances!",finance
