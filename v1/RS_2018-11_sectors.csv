CryptoCurrency,Brazilian Banks Ordered to Reopen Cryptocurrency Exchange’s Frozen Accounts,"**A Brazilian court has ordered the reopening of cryptocurrency exchange Bitcoin Max’s bank accounts, which were closed without explanation by Banco do Brasil and Banco Santander in September. The two banks have reportedly reactivated the accounts to avoid paying fines.**

## Threat of Fine Forces Banco Do Brasil and Banco Santander to Reactivate Exchange’s Accounts

According to local news site [Portal do Bitcoin](https://portaldobitcoin.com/banco-do-brasil-e-santander-reabrem-conta-de-corretora-de-bitcoin-para-nao-pagarem-multa/), Brazil’s Federal District Court promised to slap Santander with a fine of 5,000 real ($1,350) and Banco do Brasil with 20,000 real ($5,400) should both fail to comply with the preliminary judgement. Leonardo Ranna, a lawyer representing Bitcoin Max, said that all of the exchange’s accounts “have been restored, including those of exchange partners.”

Some months expenses are larger than others because of the student loan payments, but I also travel for work semi-frequently and put the expenses on my CC and get reimbursed for the majority of the expenses (i.e. take home income is larger some months as well).

What I want to know and what my parents are trying to decide is what is the best way to attack the Parent Plus loans. We have a couple different options that we could go with and I want a few different opinions on what to do.

* Option 1: Pay off the loan as aggressively as I did with my Great Lakes and fight a 6% interest rate along the way. Possible help from parents? They help pay 20% of the full Parent Plus? I pay 80%? 

* Option 2: Refinance with SoFi (or something similar. Personal Loan?) and see if we can consolidate the loan and get a better interest rate.

* Option 3: Take out money from parents (Current age 60) 401K to pay off current Parent Plus in full. Pay back parents interest free on a payment plan. 

* Option 4: Take out cash value of a life insurance policy. Not able to pay the Parent Plus off fully. Allows us to reduce principle of the Parent Plus though. Payback parents interest free.

My personal goals would be to hopefully get these loans paid off ASAP (2 years?) and then start saving for a place of my own, start an additional IRA, and beef up my emergency fund. Please advise on what you would do in this situation to set yourself up for future PF success. Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Help with refinancing my student loans,"Hey all! 

I'm graduating in December, getting a full time job out of school (numbers aren't fully decided yet, but most likely around 55k), living at home with no rent or extreme living expenses (other than commute to work), and a frugal spender. Basically all of my income is going to go toward this debt. I also have a very good credit score, and I'm able to get co-signers (my parents) with very good credit to help me out in any steps needed. They're also going to be helping me out in small chunks at a time. I just want to get some opinions on this and make sure I'm doing it all right.

I have about 60k in student loans, 1/3 of it federal with relatively low interest rates, and the rest of it with private companies with about 6-6.3% interest. They've all been accumulating interest, and I haven't made any payments to them yet, as I've been putting all of my extra money directly to tuition so the loans are smaller.

I know I should be looking to pay off the private loans first, because they will accumulate more quickly (due to the interest rates). I'm following the wiki/sub recommended ""avalanche method"", because it makes the most sense to me. However, I just really wanted to learn more about refinancing. I've been reading into First Republic, and it WILL be an option for me, which I am extremely grateful for, however I'm just not sure when/how exactly I should refinance. 

Can anyone give me a crash course? I know that not everyone with a short credit history is approved, but I would have my parents. I would have an income, but I'm not sure how quickly after I started working that they would count it as income, if that makes sense.

When I refinance, I'm assuming I have to combine each of the private loans from this (or that would make the most sense at least), right? Is there something I'm missing completely? 

Thank you in advance, I really appreciate your guys' help!",finance

Bitcoin,Went as the Bitcoin Whitepaper for Halloween.,"Happy Halloween! 🎃 Since today marks the 10 year anniversary of the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper, I decided I'd honor the day by whipping up a last-minute costume and go as the Bitcoin whitepaper. When I first read the whitepaper in 2011, it completely went over my head, but as an ""End-The-Fed"" philosophical anarchist, I at least thought it was a cool idea. I had no idea this 9-page document written by the unknown person/people known as Satoshi Nakamoto outlined the world's first natively-digital currency, and that this would be the birth of blockchain technology as we know it.  It's even more amazing seeing this one publication has led to an entirely new global technology, and more importantly, a philosophical movement toward decentralization and away from authoritarianism. 💖

For anyone interested in using my oh-so-creative and complicated costume idea, here's how I made it: First, I edited the document to fit on four sheets of paper, which I then taped to a USPS priority mail box that I cut and unfolded. I made the mask using the Bitcoin icon on its side for the eyes (which I cut out so I could see, of course), my wallet QR code for the nose, and the public address for the mouth. I also taped that to cardboard for stability since it's blustery outside this time of year. And yes, that's a drum stick it's attached to, but I'm sure you could use a ruler or chopstick if you don't have drum sticks laying around. 😉

For anybody who hasn't read the whitepaper, it's very short and fascinating, and well worth the read. I still don't understand many parts of it, but each time I read it I think I'm getting a little bit more. Here's the direct link to the original PDF for anyone interested: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf 🤩

I hope this is at least somewhat enjoyable for someone to see. Happy Bitcoinaween!

btc,How can Bitcoin survive via hash voting and economic incentives if the world's economy is controlled and manipulated? November 15th scenario,"Let's play a game for the purpose of this discussion and let's all put our tinfoil hats on. Create a folder in your mind named ""possibilities"" and play along, if you will.

&amp;#x200B;

Picture a world totally controlled by a mechanism called money that some private entities issue and manipulate. They dictate interest rates of central banks, orchestrate the economic crises, manipulate the money supply creating money out of thin air and use this air, among other things, for buying bonds and public debt and give a false sense of economic stability.

&amp;#x200B;

Picture an evil elite using this mechanism to buy out all the main governments, pharmaceutical companies, patent offices, education system and communication channels.

 \- Internet is born and frees communications, yet they do as much as possible to control ISPs, issue surveillance laws (the Five Eyes Alliance), control main media channels like Facebook and Twitter and ban dissenting opinions, and keep a firm grip on the population, giving people a false sense of freedom.

&amp;#x200B;

\- One day Bitcoin is born. Years later, they manage to buy all the developpers under a single company and ban and smear all those who don't comply (even Gavin Andressen himself). Via shady measures like Segwit, they prevent miner voting and hijack the main representation of the Bitcoin project (BTC). Despite a successful centralization of the only tool that can free the world and make them lose their power, Mankind continues Bitcoin's open-source project (BCH), although it is only a minority chain due to media manipulation; unbeknownst to 99% of the population, when they learn about Bitcoin they believe it is their sabotaged project (BTC). They successfully handicap it and execute ridicule campaigns in mass media about its crash from 20k to 6k (which they might have also orchestrated via tools like Tether).

&amp;#x200B;

\- The continuation of the Bitcoin project, although a minority chain, works as designed by Satoshi and keeps gaining traction and establishing itself as a working peer to peer decentralized economic system. They infiltrate the community's communication channels and manufacture dissent using sockpuppets. With the minority chain somewhat divided, the Bitcoin project has less chance of being globally adopted. Even so, they are aware sabotaging Bitcoin is easier the sooner, so they utilize false-authority characters to start trying to dictate the direction the project has to take (BSV). Could have even set up some of the characters themselves years ago (what if CSW was one of their infiltrators and had fooled Gavin with some information about Satoshi their intel had provided him for that specific purpose?).

&amp;#x200B;

\- Aware of how Bitcoin works and their inability to hijack and sabotage the development of the project and the upgrades to its protocol this time (BCH), they begin using their money (backed by nothing, created out of thin air) to purchase computing power to now sabotage the project via hash rate come November 15th's hard fork. 

&amp;#x200B;

Picture the following scenario come November 15th: they point a massive amount of hashpower to their controlled chain (BSV). The free people who want to continue Bitcoin's original project mine the other chain (BCH-BU/ABC/...). However, since they have unlimited paper money, theoretically could have unlimited hash power. Their attack could also be aided by BTC miners who would enjoy seeing BCH die. A great amount of hash power is pointed to both BCH chains from them so that:

\- They control BSV

\- There's so much hashpower in BCH-BU/ABC/... to the point of mining unprofitably unless its price pumps.

&amp;#x200B;

This causes people (Mankind, so to speak) who want to continue the Bitcoin project to have to mine at a loss due to the difficulty of the network (unless its price pumps greatly). How long can miners engage in this kind of war? Since the powers that be have unlimited fiat money, they can keep this operation going on forever, while people can't and would end up giving up. Big miners will not lose hundreds of thousands or millions of their own money in ideological wars - they are businesses after all.

worldpolitics,Why Bolsonaro was elected - What 55% of Brazil thinks,"I've posted this elsewhere but the misinformation never ends, so I'll post it here before I drop the issue entirely.

---



The people who voted for Bolsonaro are pretty disgusted and exhasperated from how he is unfairly portrayed by his opponents and the world media in general. The sad mix of truths, half-truths and lies that accompany the insults towards all who voted for him have worn us down to a nub. Families split apart, everyone fighting, getting called fascists and nazis and whatnot.

What half truths and lies you say? Well, if you're on Reddit and wonder why so many people voted for this obviously homophobic guy, you need to look no further than:

1. **His opponent represents PT, the Worker's Party.** You might think they're corrupt or very corrupt, but that doesn't begin to describe it. Among other things, this party put their lawyer in the supreme court. Their lawyer who had never even been a judge. Why? Because in Brazil, congressmen and presidents can only be judged by the supreme court in criminal cases. They also bribed Congress. They bribed Congress with monthly allowances in order to pass whatever they wanted. Essentially, this party has been working nonstop to circumvent the system of checks and balances in order to achieve and maintain power. Oh, and do you know the name of the ONLY guy from his party who refused the bribe outright? Bolsonaro.


2. **Not content to bribe Congress and put their lawyer in the Supreme Court, the PT then murdered a mayor** who was going to blow the whistle on what he'd found out.


3. **Pretty much the entire staff of the former president, as well as the president himself, are in jail.** His cabinet was almost all convicted. As well as the presidents of the party, treasurer, marketing manager. For all that you can imagine: corruption, money laundering, fraud. They stole billions, with a B, from our state companies as well as offered 


4. **The Worker's Party then attacked** anyone who wouldn't support them as coup-supporting fascists, making absurd claims that they were being taken down because the elites were angry at having to see black and poor people in colleges. Absurd and inflammatory rhetoric based on those old socialist cliches that actually did manage to split our country apart.


5. **So, back to Bolsonaro. You know how everyone tells you he said that he wouldn't rape a congresswoman because she was too ugly?** you kind of get the impression that he just waltzed right into the congress floor and said it willy nilly. In fact, they were having a huge fight over her defense of a 16 year old murderer-rapist while Bolsonaro was arguing that we should allow him to be trialed as an adult, when SHE shouted that Bolsonaro was a rapist himself. Out of nowhere, with no basis or foundation whatsoever, she flat out accused a congressman of being a rapist in the heat of an argument. No, there was no reason to think so, probably just an irresponsible metaphor by a self-righteous person. His reply was ""and you're too ugly to rape"". It's schoolyard bullshit, sure it's a terrible thing to say, but when you get called a rapist in congress I'll give you a pass to blurt out horrific shit right back at someone. But every time this gets reported, context is removed entirely. So once again if you vote for him you vote for a man who claims women deserve to be raped. 55% of the country who know better have to hear this shit.


6. **You know how politicians in America always get bribed by companies who support their campaigns? Well, when a company that bought off all of congress sent his party their share and they gave Bolsonaro his share, he sent it right back** and said he only wanted what was due to him from the federal party-allocated funds. He then had it registered by a notary and made sure to tell people what was going on so they could see how bribery worked. Have you ever seen a politician give BACK money that everyone else got? That makes twice already when he refused a bribe that everyone else took and he had no reason not to. This is the thing about this guy, he was a congressman for 30 years and they dug and dug and dug and couldn't find shit on him. As he says "" they call me all sorts of garbage, like racist and sexist. They make it up because they can't call me corrupt.""


7. **So, the guy is honest. What else? Well, he's also an economic liberal.** We've never had an economic liberal as a president before. FHC fixed our economy and he is called a neoliberal for subscribing to the Washington Consensus, but he is in fact a social-democrat and widely regarded leftist intellectual. Brazil has some of the most expensive products and highest taxes in the world and what we get back is shit.


8. **Fascism. People keep throwing this word around.** They claim Bolsonaro is antidemocratic because of shit he said 30 years ago, 20 years ago, and blowing up what he said recently. He didn't say "" we will shoot our enemies!"" in a Mussolini rant, he said it laughingly during ONE rally once, as a metaphor that we will "" machine gun our enemies"" and made a machine gun noise while he and everyone there laughed in a silly manner. Out of context quotes from a guy who has no filter have been used to slander him and misrepresent him again and again and again. It didn't work though, 55% of the country saw through it. We actually see the news. We're in here. We know what's going on. You know what's fascistic? WANTING TO CONTROL THE MEDIA AS THE WORKER'S PARTY CLAIMED. THEY TRIED TO SUPPRESS WHATSAPP BEFORE THE ELECTIONS AS WELL. Bolsonaro is openly in FAVOR of a free media and that is part of his government plan. You know what's fascistic? BRIBING CONGRESS, MAYORS, GOVERNORS AND PUTTING YOUR LAWYER ON THE SUPREME COURT. That's what's fucking fascistic. That's what the Worker's Party did.


9. **He is a homophobe. Used to be rabid, has become moderate. But he never suggested any policy against gay people. Nor was that part of his campaign.** In fact, during his campaign he was explicit in saying that all citizens are equal and people can do what they want in their private life as long as they don't use the media as a tool of propaganda. Conservative? Yes. Too much so. But not a hatemonger. Once again, he didn't advocate any policies against gay people nor was it part of his campaign. In fact, he has apologized for comments made in the heat of the moment in the past. After elected, he said that anyone who attacks others will be punished by the law, and anyone who does so for such reasons (homophobia) shall have their prison time increased. *AFTER his election he has declared himself against hate crimes against gay people.* and here he is with a gay supporter: https://www.instagram.com/p/BpfnxJWH-N9/?taken-by=agustinofficial


10. **Racist?** His ex-wife was brown and his father in law is black. He made one stupid joke, one time, and that's it. Even though he helped elect a black sargeant to congress in Rio who is also a close personal friend. Once again we have people scouring everything someone ever did or said to find things that they can latch onto to slander him. This was bullshit, utter nonsense. He never said ""afro brazilians are lazy"". This is insane. And CERTAINLY he never advocated against black people or minorities. He is agaist affirmative action, like most liberal conservatives are.


11. **Oh, the military police closed schools with fascist stuff!** Well, military police in Brazil is just regular police. They aren't part of the actual armed forces or national defense. They're our cops who patrol the streets and fight crime. And they closed down unions doing political work in federal buildings against electoral law during electoral season. Electoral law in Brazil is super strict. A presidential candidate on the other side of the country had nothing to do with it. He doesn't have that kind of power. He's an outsider, and was just an army captain. It was judges, civil judges who ordered the police to enforce electoral law. Those antifascist were doing left wing propaganda. And hey, you know what, freedom of expression is great. If they had gone to the streets like millions of brazilians went , they'd have been free to defende whoever. But they were shut down for doing that in state universities, where neutrality is kept. And somehow this is blamed on a candidate that had nothing to do with it. Really?


12. **His first interview to the TV , he said ""opposition is important to keep bad ideas in check"", that his party should not have the presidency of congress, that there should be plurality of parties among the directors that brazilians of all races and orientations are equal and shall have their rights assured, that the only leftists who deserve banishment are the violent militants who invade and destroy things (the MST), that he is interested in working with the opponents even though they attacked him destructively and not constructively, that the supreme court has his respect and will never be contested.** A moderate, center-right guy who has no reason to lie at this point is showing himself to be a moderate and calm man. This is nothing like Duterte (fuck Duterte), this is nothing like Pinochet (fuck him too).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-JG6xNzXQs



So you asked what the public sentiment is. **It's anger.**  55% of the country who voted on that guy is pissed at being misrepresented again and again and again. The dishonest portrayal, the accusations. Regular people who voted against the biggest, most corrupt, evil party we've ever had are accused of being closeted homophobes because of it.

So yes, we are pissed. But glad they're gone and hoping the new president will live up to the expectations placed upon him as well as displaying that he has grown as a person since he said stupid things in the past.",finance

investing,Am I misunderstanding something or is real estate a really bad investment option in NYC,"As most know rent in NYC is stratospheric. I was tempted to purchase in order to not just transfer money to someone else, but doing the math is sobering. 

Let’s say you need to borrow $1m to pay for an appartment that would normally rent around $5,000 per month. 

With a mortgage interest rate of 4.5% (which apparently is considered low), this means that in the first few years you need to pay approx 40/45k a year just in bank fees.

With a real estate tax rate of approx 1.8%, on a $1.5m house you have to pay $27,750 a year in taxes.

Add MOAs that can easily be around $10,800 annually.

This means you have to pay $6,500/month at least for the first few years. Before you even start contributing to your equity. 

I know that there is the appreciation of the appartement can make it worth it, but that’s a pretty big gamble and a game of very average return over the last decade.

Ultimately I just don’t see how buying makes sense in this market. I have seen other regions where it can (lower taxes, no MOA, half the mortgage rate), but in this kind of city, I don’t see it. Am I missing something?",finance

I also trialed their premium for free and did not like it at all, it kept wanting to delete things I wanted to keep, I didn't find the program ""sleep"" function useful (it creates more damn pop-ups when a program ""wakes up""), and generally found the premium to be completely unnecessary.

So, I'm done. Too fed-up to deal with it any more. 

I'd like a recommendation for an anti-virus program with a free version that does not force pop-ups on my *desktop*. In the software is fine, but not on my desktop.

personalfinance,My salary does not count as earned income. How to contribute to my IRA?,"So, my 50k/year salary does not count as earned income.  Technically, it's not even a salary.  I have no idea why it is designated that way, but basically I am paid by a training fellowship from the federal government.  I do not receive a W2, or ANY tax document from my employer.    
So, for the next couple of years, how to contribute to my IRA?  I have most of my money (20k or so) in mutual funds, and another 6K in government bonds. I have about 15K in my IRA, and would like there to be more (I'm 28 years old).  My original contribution to the mutual funds was from bona fide earned income; I don't think the government bonds count as earned income (cumulative present from grandma over 15 years; about half of the current value is from accrued interest).  Can I take out money from my mutual funds and put it into my IRA?  Do I have to calculate what % of that value exists only due to accrued interest?    


I am not considered a real employee, and have no matching options or 403 options at my company.  They do have an option for me to set aside pre-tax dollars for medical purposes, but I only need about $200 worth of medical care a year, at most, and anything else I ask them to set aside will disappear from my paycheck forever and not carry over to the next year.  The earned income issue does not prevent me from feeding my mutual funds, so I'm not sure how much ground I lose if I'm restricted from contributing to a tax-protected account for the next few years....",finance

personalfinance,Need advice for potential job change,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I need your advice on what I should do in this situation. Currently, I'm at a job working for a mid-sized non-profit research institution. I was recently offered a federal position in the same field that I am currently employed in.

I have been in my current position for four months. I like the team I'm working with and I've learned a great deal of new knowledge working with them. I believe I have potential to move up to a Senior position by this time next year, as the person that I replaced when I was hired was in a Senior position.

The position I have been offered would be a lateral move. I would get a roughly 4.6% pay increase, and better benefits and flexibility due to it being a federal position. However, the position is temporary for 2 years pending it being converted to a permanent position if they decide they want to keep me on, and it appears the grade level will be capped at the grade level I am coming in at, which means as long as I remain in that position, unless the permanent position I am converted too has a different grade level cap, I will only be eligible for step increases.

While I believe I may enjoy the work in the federal job slightly more than my current job, I am early in my career and the lack of advancement within the position is concerning.

Has anyone been in a similar position before? And if so, what would your advice be? Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"Series I Bonds Fixed Rate to 0.50%, Composite Rate to 2.83%; The Role of Savings Bonds In Your Portfolio","**November 1, 2018** – Series I Bonds purchased in the next six months have a fixed rate of 0.50% and a composite rate of 2.83%

As the Federal Reserve continues to raise federal lending rates, it is fairly safe to assume that the fixed rate on Series I bonds will continue to climb, too. While the fixed rate today is nowhere near historical highs (https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm), we can see that fixed rates are trending up. The fixed rate is now the highest it has been since November 1, 2008. 

**Background**

Series I bonds are U.S government-backed savings bonds that are considered to be one of the safest financial vehicles available for consumers. The reason behind this is two-fold: (1) the bonds cannot lose their value (i.e., their purchase price, plus any interest already gained), and (2) being backed by the federal government means you are guaranteed to the redemption price of the bond, unless the federal government fails (highly unlikely). The interest rate of these bonds is the combination of two components: a fixed rate, that is set for the 30-year life of the bond, and a variable component that is adjusted to inflation every six months (changes on May 1 and November 1). Although the variable and fixed components are announced in May/November, the current variable rate applies for six months following the purchase date of the bond (e.g., buying a bond in January means your rates change in July and January). See the above link for a table that goes a bit more in depth.
The composite rate is the combination of the fixed rate and variable rate. A sample calculation can be found by following the link above, but the equation is this: *Composite rate = [fixed rate + (2 x semiannual inflation rate) + (fixed rate x semiannual inflation rate)]*. The composite rate is adjusted every six months as well (since the variable rate is adjusted) and is the interest rate that the bond is actually earning. The composite rate also can never go negative. If deflation occurs, and the composite rate equation spits out a negative number, the composite rate will be set at 0.0%. This is what I alluded to earlier (Series I bonds can never decrease in value).

**Buying/Selling**

There are two methods to buy these bonds. The primary method involves setting up an account on TreasuryDirect and purchasing them electronically with a bank account. Each person is limited to purchasing $10,000 of Series I bonds annually with this method. The second method is using your tax refund to buy paper bonds. Each person is limited to buying $5,000 of Series I bonds annually with this method. The limits on these two methods are separate, meaning you are able to purchase $15,000 of Series I bonds annually. You cannot buy these bonds in a regular brokerage account. This link has more details:(https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm). 
There are some restrictions on selling the bonds. A bond cannot be sold until it’s been held for at least one year after purchase. Until five years after the purchase date has elapsed, you will lose three months of interest upon selling the bond. The current price displayed in TreasuryDirect should exclude the last three months of interest to reflect this. After 30 years, the bond has “matured” and will no longer earn interest; at this point, you should strongly consider selling the bond since it is no longer increasing in value. 
Interest on the bonds are taxable at the federal level, but not at the state or local level. The exemption to this rule is if the interest is going towards funding education (https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/planning/plan_education.htm). You are free to pay taxes on interest annually (as the bonds are accumulating interest) or delay paying taxes until redemption of the bond occurs. 

**Pros/Cons of Series I Bonds**

Pros:

* Inflation-adjusted return plus fixed rate means, at a minimum, are matching inflation

* Cannot decrease in value

* Are extremely safe (U.S government-backed)

* Funds transferred from sale of bond to bank account within a few days 

* In high-interest environments, you lock in a great fixed rate (e.g., 3.60% in 2000, composite rate for these is ~6% currently) for up to 30 years

* Beats interest rate of even “high-interest” banks

* TreasuryDirect website employs two-factor authentication for added security

Cons:

* Many find the TreasuryDirect website to be not user-friendly

* If theft of bonds occurs in TreasuryDirect account, there are no guidelines helping you to retrieve lost funds 
(there are guidelines for paper bonds, however)

* Equities, especially in low-interest environments, will likely beat Series I bonds over the long-term

* Have to lock up funds for one year, forfeit three months of interest if sold before five-year mark

**So where do these bonds fit into my portfolio?**

I don’t have cookie cutter advice on purchasing Series I bonds. Many people feel they are worthless in a low-interest environment like today. However, as interest rates rise, I see these savings bonds becoming more useful and popular.
One popular use is using Series I bonds as a vehicle for an emergency fund. There is a great post and subsequent discussion on this: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/78uroy/okay_reddit_lets_talk_about_using_series_i_bonds/. One thing I’ll note is that it is strongly recommended to have access to additional funds that can temporarily supplement your emergency fund if you go this route. It is a good idea to slowly buy Series I bonds due to the one-year hold. If you throw your entire emergency fund into Series I bonds and three months later you have a need to access those funds, you’re out of luck.
Another use is for savings goals that are at least one year away but have an otherwise unknown timeline (e.g., buying a house). I’m guessing many people who are saving for a house down payment within five years (or perhaps longer) are not willing to risk losing a portion of their savings in the stock market or some other relatively risky investment. Many people will instead just hold this money in a savings account. Series I bonds will likely come out ahead compared to a savings account with little to no added risk.
Perhaps you are moderately or highly risk-averse and are trying to save for a longer-term goal. Series I bonds may be a good idea; however, this will depend on your risk tolerance. If you have children and would like to pay for their college tuition, this may be a suitable vehicle. A 529 plan will likely yield better long-term results, but if you have a low risk tolerance, that may not be your cup of tea. Plus, if funds from a 529 plan are withdrawn and used for something other than education expense (in the event your children do not go to college), there may be fees involved. 

**Closing Thoughts**

* There are also Series EE Savings Bonds; personally, I feel that either Series I bonds or equities would be a superior choice (depending on your needs, risk tolerance, etc.), at least at this point in time. However, I honestly am not very familiar with Series EE bonds. 
* With rising interest rates, perhaps some feel they should wait since the fixed interest rate may be high in six months. Keep in mind that you can sell Series I bonds after a year and reinvest in new bonds at the (presumably) higher fixed rate.
* Consider buying Series I bonds near the end of the month and selling them near the beginning of the month. The interest is compounded monthly, and you receive the entire month’s interest regardless of the buy or sell date.

Bitcoin,Feds unveil proposal to ease regulations for larger banks. HODL on.,,cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,"""Bitcoin will replace banks"" makes no sense.","So I have an issue with one of the most common phrases I hear relating to Bitcoin, that being the title of this post.

One of the primary functions of banks is to accept deposits, and through aggregating a range of deposit sizes, provide loans for businesses, housing etc. They are mostly rewarded financially via the difference in interest rates between the deposits they service and the loans they issue. To do this effectively they need to assess and accept the risk of each loan they issue and price them accordingly. 

Whether or not you think they do a good job of this/ are greedy/ are stupid/ have screwed up royally/ etc. is irrelevant to the fact that this is their main business model and it serves a necessary function in society.

Banks don't control the workings of the money itself. If you want to say Bitcoin will replace \[insert government institution responsible for operating the distribution of cash and the main ledger in your nation\], and cash itself, then sure. But the world would be super bad off if we had no banks and just bitcoin. 

Banks will still exist in a bitcoin dominated world. If you want any interest on your bitcoin you'll need to deposit it to one of these ""centralised"" institutions.

Am I missing something here? I think crypto currencies are a pretty incredible innovation, and will take a while to perfect, but they don't eliminate the many financial institutions which under-pin our society just because they change how money is recorded.",cryptocurrency

WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today announced cost of living adjustments affecting dollar limitations for pension plans and other retirement-related items for tax year 2019.  The IRS today issued technical guidance detailing these items in [Notice 2018-83](http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTgxMTAxLjk3MDI5NjcxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE4MTEwMS45NzAyOTY3MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MjE0NjI1JmVtYWlsaWQ9ZGF2aWRAcnJtb2F0c2NwYS5jb20mdXNlcmlkPWRhdmlkQHJybW9hdHNjcGEuY29tJmZsPSZleHRyYT1NdWx0aXZhcmlhdGVJZD0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;127&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-18-83.pdf).

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights of Changes for 2019**

The contribution limit for employees who participate in 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans, and the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan is increased from $18,500 to $19,000.

The limit on annual contributions to an IRA, which last increased in 2013, is increased from $5,500 to $6,000. The additional catch-up contribution limit for individuals aged 50 and over is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $1,000.

The income ranges for determining eligibility to make deductible contributions to traditional Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs), to contribute to Roth IRAs and to claim the saver’s credit all increased for 2019.

Taxpayers can deduct contributions to a traditional IRA if they meet certain conditions. If during the year either the taxpayer or their spouse was covered by a retirement plan at work, the deduction may be reduced, or phased out, until it is eliminated, depending on filing status and income. (If neither the taxpayer nor their spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work, the phase-outs of the deduction do not apply.) Here are the phase-out ranges for 2019:

* For single taxpayers covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is $64,000 to $74,000, up from $63,000 to $73,000.
* For married couples filing jointly, where the spouse making the IRA contribution is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is $103,000 to $123,000, up from $101,000 to $121,000.
* For an IRA contributor who is not covered by a workplace retirement plan and is married to someone who is covered, the deduction is phased out if the couple’s income is between $193,000 and $203,000, up from $189,000 and $199,000.
* For a married individual filing a separate return who is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $0 to $10,000.

The income phase-out range for taxpayers making contributions to a Roth IRA is $122,000 to $137,000 for singles and heads of household, up from $120,000 to $135,000. For married couples filing jointly, the income phase-out range is $193,000 to $203,000, up from $189,000 to $199,000. The phase-out range for a married individual filing a separate return who makes contributions to a Roth IRA is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $0 to $10,000.

The income limit for the Saver’s Credit (also known as the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit) for low- and moderate-income workers is $64,000 for married couples filing jointly, up from $63,000; $48,000 for heads of household, up from $47,250; and $32,000 for singles and married individuals filing separately, up from $31,500.

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights of Limitations that Remain Unchanged from 2018**

The catch-up contribution limit for employees aged 50 and over who participate in 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans and the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan remains unchanged at $6,000.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm single, and foresee the following deductions:

1. state income tax of $3500

2. 401k contributions of at least $6000 (I'll be maximizing matching, and ramping up contribution after my credit card is paid off in a couple months)

3. Student loan interest payments in the $1000 range

It's my understanding that 2 allowances gets you to ""typical"" withholding amounts, and each additional allowance is equal to my marginal rate x the personal allowance (0.22*4150=913)

I don't mind erring on the side of a having to pay out for 2019, but I don't know if the above deductions (aside from student loan interest) are essentially baked into the withholding already.

Is 3 allowances safe?  4?  1 billion?  Or should I just stick with 2?

Thanks!

EDIT: I'm aware my debt profile is terrible, btw.  I had a series of financial situations not panning out as planned, and used a credit card with a recently-expired grace period to get where I am.  It is what it is.

Debt to pay off:

* $10k on the credit card by the time I start paying it down

* $13k in student loans

* Another $14k at 0% APR until next August, which I used to ease the monthly payment on the student loans for my dad and give me cash to be able to move and get this job

Again, terrible debt profile.  I also have federal student loans which are at income-based repayment of $55/mo, and which will be reevaluated in July.

I probably have a windfall of $2000-4000 in the next month or so, which will go towards the credit card, obviously.",finance

The government didn't really fix the problem, they bailed out every company which put them at new ATH in debt and set interest rates to 0%.

Yep, check this [chart](https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/charts/united-states-interest-rate.png?s=fdtr&amp;v=201811011527y&amp;d1=19180101&amp;d2=20181231)

personalfinance,Building an emergency fund,"Okay so the general rule of thumb anytime I see reports and advice on emergency fund savings is to have 3-9 months of your salary saved away for the rainy day. Even the reddit wiki ([https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/emergencyfunds](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/emergencyfunds)) recommends up to 6 months. What all this advice seams to neglect is how to actually BUILD an emergency fund to that kind of level. 

Lets start with some basic math, that you have an average american family income of $60,000. That would put your emergency fund savings target at about $30,000! That means it would take **5 entire years (60 months) to reach that level of emergency savings.** 

&amp;#x200B;

|**US Real Median Household Income**|$60,000|
|:-|:-|
|Monthly Income |$5,000|
|Target Emergency Savings (In Months)|6|
|Target Emergency Savings Amt.|$30,000|
|||
|Amt. Put to Emergency Savings Per Month (%)|10%|
|Amt. Put to Emergency Savings Per Month ($)|$500|
|||
|Months to Reach Target Amt.|60|
|Years to Reach Target Amt. |5|
|||

That also assumes you don't actually have an emergency during that 5 year period that would require you to pull some out (such as a car issue, health issue, housing issue, or family issue). Furthermore because emergency savings need to be liquid the interest rate on the funds is low-to-non-existent. Another BIG assumption is that you have a full 10% of that income to put towards emergency savings every month. There are other expenses (such as student debt, or health related debt, credit card debit from previous poor financial management) that drastically prevent a huge portion of the population from even being able to reach a 10% contribution level. Given that, if you are putting money away towards an emergency fund / rainyday fund, how are you able to save for other big ticket items. Such as a used car, vacation, college, wedding -- or even extra money toward retirement.  


So:

1) What is a realistic rainyday fund?

2) What are the best ways to save for it?

3) Where should it be on your priority list for other savings goals (Vacation, Car, Down Payment on house, Retirement, etc.) ?

4) Is there any role in unsecured debt options when facing a rainy-day as apart of the emergency fund planning / building process?",finance
personalfinance,Should I be setting up my own 401k? Will it transfer when I move jobs? (US),"I'm 26, in graduate school getting my Phd. This is advertised as $25k stipend,

Take home after taxes is $1800 a month
Student fees add up to $3k a year

I  have a part time job as well.
It's kind of under the table, I haven't reported it because it's so sporadic how much I make from it. But probably an additional $500 a month.

I had $8k in credit card debt
and $6k left in student fees to pay before I graduate. Every month I was paying around $600-$700 in credit card fees and the student fees and still not making a dent into my credit.

I took out a student loan for $14k. Deferred payment with 8.5% interest rate.

I paid off all of my credit with it and put the rest in a savings account to pay the student fees as they come up (3 times a year).

Now I put $300 every month into that loan. 

Now I've finally been able to save up $1k for an emergency fund.

I'm thinking my next financial goals are going to be to get a month ahead on my bills. I would also like to save up so money to pay some bills in bulk (cheaper) like my car insurance. 

I have no retirement fund yet. And once I graduate and get a real job I'm sure I will get a 401k. I don't know how it works really... and I'm wondering if it would be smart to put a little bit away now  for it, or just wait until then (2 years from now)? Would it be smarter to just put those extra pennies back into my loan? Also if I started one myself (no retirement plans offered through a grad school stipend), would it transfer easily into a future employer's 401k? How does it work when you move jobs?

personalfinance,"Salary increasing soon, question on how best to manage debt for now","Hi /r/personalfinance,

I’m a medical resident right now, making $50k. In July I’ll start my first job, and I signed a contract with a $15k sign on bonus and $240k salary. So I have a question how best to manage debt.

My student loans are at $500k, but I’m on an income driven payment plan so 10% of my income goes to those loans every year. After 7 more years whatever is left will be forgiven.

My other debt is in credit cards, and totals about $35k. It is all on 0% interest until Aug 2019 after I start my new job. I plan to pay it off with my sign on bonus and the first few paychecks. 

That was my plan, but my dad recently asked me for help. They are having trouble keeping up with their monthly credit card payments and just had an accident which totaled one of their 2 cars. They want to take a personal loan to have a lower interest rate on their other debt and get a new car. However their credit history is poor and they were denied. So my dad asked me if I could take a personal loan for $40k and he will make the monthly payments. 

My credit score is 670, and I was hoping to get a house and car after paying off my credit card debt next year (I’m married and we have a 2 month old girl). So my question is, would a personal loan be the best way to help my parents out now? Would it hurt my credit score and make it difficult to get a home/auto loan next year? 

I do want to help my parents, because about $20k of their debt was from throwing my wife and me a great wedding. What do you think is the best way to navigate this situation?",finance

I am 19 with 3k in the bank. Just recently my car that I bought for $1300 2 years ago had it's transmission go out and now I either need to pony up the money to fix it or buy a new car. 
The old car is a 93 Subaru Impreza with 143k miles and has been in one wreck since I bought it. I have already put some money into it trying to turn it into a battlewagon but then the transmission died.  Is it worth it to replace the transmission for a cost of around $2800 and drive it till it dies again?
If I buy a new used car I have an upper limit set by myself of $12k with a $1500-2000 down payment and I have a pre approved loan of 14k at a 4.24% interest rate for a 5 year term. That is with a cosigner with a good credit history. My personal current score is 754.

financialindependence,It's almost always better to invest as opposed to paying down a mortgage,"**TL/DR** I believe that, in most cases, a *rational investor* with a sufficiently long term view - say *greater than 10 years* \- is better off carrying a home mortgage and investing the difference in a broad index fund.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT/NOTE : PLEASE. I am not interested in discussing emotional aspects of investing. I fully understand those exist and they color every decision. All I want to discuss here is the raw numbers. Somebody at a higher pay grade has to decide how to integrate the numbers with emotion.**

**I prefer to make an informed decision and, for that, I need hard numbers. That's all I'm saying. Not that you did wrong or I did right. You may take the numbers and go one way and I may go another. Fine.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Details**

Your goal is to convince me there are reasonable scenarios where it is better to pay down or avoid a mortgage. I will use hard simulation data to support or disprove the hypothesis. If you have a new scenario, I can run it or I can try to code the simulator to support it - if possible. Obviously, risk is an important consideration. To reduce the impact of risk, I am limiting bonds to 1 year US treasuries and limiting stocks to the S&amp;P 500.

The simulator compares paying off a mortgage/paying down a mortgage vs investing in the S&amp;P 500. The C# code for this simulator is on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnweeder/MortgageInvestmentSimulator). There are no secrets here. The data and the simulator itself are public knowledge.

The simulator uses actual **historical market data** for the S&amp;P 500 (price and dividend), 1 year US treasuries, monthly inflation, and the average monthly mortgage interest rate. The simulation runs starting each month from April 1972 until September 2013. Buying/selling is done purely as needed (spot) with no attempt to guess the market. A small amount of cash is maintained and the remainder of the money is either invested in 1 year treasuries or in the S&amp;P 500. The stock/bond mix is a parameter of the simulation. The simulation makes attempts to include taxation. The simulation treats bond buying and selling in a very crude matter and does not include transaction fees or discounts. Essentially, this means all simulation can invest any funds at the 1 year US treasury rate. Stock buying and selling does not have transaction fees (yet).

By default, the inflation adjusts the values at the start of each run for inflation. The simulation then adjusts the results to today's dollars. This can be turned on and off.

*It is likely there are still bugs in the simulator.* No program is without bugs. If you find problems, I will try to fix them and report data which is significantly mis-representative.

The simulator has a number of options and you can vary them within reason. In all cases, the simulation makes 2 passes. One pass tries to maximize investment and one pass tries to avoid or pay off a mortgage as soon as possible.

* You can control whether the simulation tries to avoid or pay off a mortgage as soon as possible.
* You can control how many years the simulation runs.
* You can control the value of the home you are buying. Downpayment, PMI, taxes and insurance are not part of the simulation because they are invariant.
* You can optionally supply a monthly income (during wealth accumulation phase).
* You can optionally supply a starting cash amout (for people who are retiring soon and may want to pay off a mortgage).
* You can control the percentage of bonds to stocks.
* You can have the simulation rebalance your portfolio at some interval of months.
* You can specify a 15 or 30 year mortgage.
* You can specify a mortgage origination fee (to justify refinancing).
* You can allow or disallow mortgage refinancing.
* You can define various tax rates.
* You can allow or disallow mortgage interest deductions.
* You can set threshhold amounts for stock and bond purchases to prevent frequent trading - given there are no transaction fees.
* You can control whether or not inflation adjustments are made.
* Monthly income can be fixed, fixed/inflation adjust, fixed/inflation adjusted monthly or equal to mortgage payment.
* You can take money out at refinance in order to invest.
* You can specify an extra amount to pay each month on the mortgage (if you have cash available).

personalfinance,Doctoral student with new twins needs advice,"Hi all. Been lurking for about two weeks and I’m learning a ton. I’m married with school age twins and a new set of 3 month old twins. My wife just returned to work part time two weeks ago and returns full time in January for the county.  I’m wracking my brain to try and figure out the best way to get through the remainder of my graduate program (about 20 months) in the best financial shape possible. 

Here’s the damage. 

Mortgage- 165k left of a 30 year at 3.5% - $1140 per month

HELOC - 40k left, 13 year amortization, 4.5%

Wife’s student loans total about 45k @ 5-6.5%

Edit: $18k in savings, need to eat 6k for wife’s surgery in December 

I have 5k in fed loans so far for my doctorate. Up to this point in my education, I’ve been relying on a trust fund for tuition and expenses. It got me through undergrad and a masters degree and 3.5 years of doctorate school, but it’s gone. I wish I knew at 18 what I know now-I could have squeezed another year out of it, but that’s my stupid tax. 

Here is the rub. My last year in my program requires a full time internship but pays on average only $25k. My wife presently earns 47.5k gross. In my area, a year of full time day care is going to cost an absolute minimum of $20k, realistically more like 25-30k. My wife could try and move to part time and save on day care but then we’re short living expenses. We can make our month to month work on $4500 a month net, probably $4200 for a year push comes to shove. 

Am I missing something? I’m really trying not to get more debt, and frankly we already have a lot. Im also not sure how I could work a second job on internship with 4 kids at home and trying to finish a dissertation. 

FWIW, my expected salary after graduation will be between 50k and 65k. My wife really wants to work part time at that point until the littles are in kindergarten.

She may not be ""fan"" of bitcoin,"" but former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen now has a small amount of BTC in her possession.

On Monday, [Yellen explained](https://www.coindesk.com/former-fed-chair-janet-yellen-is-not-a-fan-of-bitcoin/) why she believes bitcoin is not a useful form of currency during an appearance at the Canada Fintech Forum. The former chairperson of the U.S. central bank has struck critical tones in the past toward cryptocurrency, but elsewhere had said she views blockchain as an ""[important technology](https://www.coindesk.com/fed-yellen-blockchain-important-tech/).""

A day later, according to an email obtained by CoinDesk, Raz Suprovici, the founder of bitcoin gifting service [Biterica](https://biterica.com/), sent Yellen 0.0031642 BTC – or roughly $20 – by way of her University of California Berkeley e-mail address.

When contacted to confirm the gift, Yellen said that she had received it but hasn't gone far in investigating her newly-obtained coins.

""I did receive a gift of bitcoins this morning and have been very busy ever since so I've not looked into it further,"" she wrote. Yellen further said that she did not have anything to add to her previous remarks about bitcoin this week.

Suprovici told CoinDesk that he wanted to help Yellen learn more about bitcoin, seeing the gift as the best avenue for that to occur.

""Based on the way she spoke about it at the conference, it seemed that she had never owned any bitcoin,"" he said, adding:

&gt;*""People are afraid of the unknown. I was hoping that when she logged into her bitcoin wallet with her ID and password, she would see it's just like a typical online bank account. The money she owns is there, in her control, ready to spend ... I hope that this sparks her openness to the technology.""*

Last year, I saved the max contribution limit ($5500, 2017) in my Traditional IRA and earlier this year I saved approximately $1500 (2018). When tax season came, I worked with a CPA because I'm a postdoctoral fellow (and contractor, not employee) and therefore, my income, which in the form of a stipend, is not subject to self-employment taxes.

I'm just \*\*so pissed\*\* about paying $30k more than I owe over ten years and getting next to nothing forgiven.

Lastly we have a 17% interest rate $11,000 balance credit card.

Estimated balance of loans is approximately $80,000.

&amp;nbsp;

My new employer does have a 401k match at 1-1 up to 4% and .25 for the next 2% (Essentially 4.5% match for 6% contribution). This equals $543.76 every month of employer contributions I'd be missing out on if I didn't take advantage of this. But also means 6% contribution of my paycheck pre-taxes. Which would bring my estimated monthly income down to **$9,424.58**.

&amp;nbsp;

Using that number, I calculate after bills that the 'leftover' amount would be about $9369.58 a month. Since my wife and I are in our mid/late 20s and have fairly good healthcare, I am not sure if emergency fund is more important then paying off high interest debt. I know there will be some people thinking that my cell/internet/food bill can be brought down, but this is not the advice I am currently looking for.

&amp;nbsp;

Do you think in my situation it is better to focus on paying off credit card first? It will take 1-2 months max to have it paid off, or to build emergency fund? Wife and I have really good healthcare and we are in our mid/late 20s.

&amp;nbsp;

I have read the flowchart on the wiki and sidebar information, but I was wondering if my situation is a bit out of the norm?

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Making 10k after taxes per month. Pay high interest (17%) credit card off first or build emergency fund?",finance
investing,My best and worst trades - Week ending October 2 2018,"Hey guys, I am going to start making these posts as a way to keep track of my trades, as well as to hopefully get some insight from the industry professionals here. I am a college student that is mainly trading options based off of my earnings forecasts, as well as some on credit ETFs and country specific ETFs.

&amp;#x200B;

# Best performing trades this week

&amp;#x200B;

# SBUX

* I was anticipating higher earnings growth for their stores in China
* I had a foretasted EPS of .64 cents a share, mainly contingent on the increased growth in their China stores, but also because of the decreased price of coffee commodities
* I bought the 62 / 62.5 debit call spread for .07 ($7) per spread expiring Friday at  midday yesterday
* They beat average earnings estimate at .62 cents per share announced post market yesterday
* Provided they open today at their postmarket price yesterday or higher of I will make 0.5 ($50) per spread
* Approximate profit : 714%

# RHT

* Legged into a trade based on pricing disparity in the weeklies following the IBM Acquisition announcement
* Bought the 180 call for 0.25
* Sold the 182.5 call for 0.30 15 minutes later
* Approximate profit: 20%

# TLT / FLRN / GSY

* This is more of a practice in portfolio ideation and management, I have a separate account from my options trading for  managing this
* Long bond ETFs decay uniquely during a rising rate environment due to the high portfolio turnover created by the Creation / Redemption unit process that is used to track the underlying. Turnover is often in excess of 100% per month. 
* Short sold TLT (20+ year treasury ETF), used cash to purchase FLRN (Float rate corporate ETF)
* Created a synthetic bond spread, as equity markets rally / interest rates rise the spread widens
* Because my net effect on cash was 0 I bought GSY to yield on the remaining cash. I am maintaining cash in the account for re-balancing weekly
* October 2018 returns: 1.65%

# Worst performing trades this week

&amp;#x200B;

# EWA

* I have been anticipating significant financial turmoil in the Australian housing market
* Majority of households are over-levered on adjustable rate debt
* Their housing situation is like 2008 on steroids, negative gearing and bad lending practices have led to a housing bubble
* The question remains as to derivatives exposure of the Australian Financials
* Bought the April 2019 18 put for 0.25 at the beginning of October
* Last week sold the April 2019 16 put for 0.25
* Cost of the trade is now 0.00, but Australian central bankers seem determined that they can sustain lower rates indefinitely so I do not anticipate a short term profit
* I anticipate having to roll the trade at beginning of Q1 next year when new options series begin trading

# EWI

* I have been bearish on Italy for months, their credit situation is a night mare, looking like a repeat of the cypress fiasco potentially
* Moody's rating of BBB for the country's credit is absurd, but well timed on their part amid demands from the Bundesbank
* Italy needs to devalue their currency and cannot due to being on the Euro
* I am the 20/19 debit put spread but am anticipating closing the trade at a loss",finance

personalfinance,How do I save and invest when I haven’t started,"Hi all. I'm looking for advice about what I should focus on once I pay off all of my credit cards in March. It'll be the first time I'm not in credit card debt. My question is, what should I do with my money? I currently owe $66,000 in student loans from my undergrad and grad programs. Each loan has a different interest rate, but the average is 5%. I pay $245/month on them and have signed up for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I only make $51K a year and I live in SoCal so my cost of living is high. I also don't have any money in savings or investments/stocks/mutual funds etc. Wondering what to do next. I’m aggressively paying off $15,000 on credit card debt.",finance
personalfinance,Marriage and HESAA/NJClass Loans,"After googleing around, I can't seem to find any answers for my question, so I'm coming to you folks to pick your brain.

My fiancé has insane student debt from HESAA/NJClass. (he's been up front about this since I met him back in college, I always knew the score)
I'm sure many of you have heard of the horror stories coming out of NJClass borrowers, he is obviously one of them. His credit keeps taking hits, NJClass refuses to work with him, and he has co-signers (I am not one of them). I think the both of us are resigned to the fact that he will never be rid of these loans.

On the other side, I only have about 30K of Federal debt I am paying back at a decent clip, I have excellent credit, and no co-signers. 

My plan is basically get married, but keep separate finances, file taxes as ""married but filling separately""  so that I can insulate myself (and keep him insulated from my debt, its ""only"" 30K, but I'd obviously not want to add any more to the mountain)
It's my understanding that the debt in his name remains his after marriage and that I would not be on the hook for it unless I co signed or something. 
Is this correct? Anything else we should look into before legally binding ourselves to each other?

personalfinance,"New Job, two finance questions","Hi everyone, apologies for the wall of text, thanks in advance for any advice you can give me!
I recently changed jobs and have run into two situations where I’m not really sure of the best course of action. 

First, I left my previous job about halfway through the month of October, but when I received my final paycheck they had paid me for the entire month. I reached out to my old boss and he said I would be contacted about how to pay back what I’d been overpaid. THEN when I got my first paycheck at my new job, I noticed they had given me a higher signing bonus amount than was stated in my offer letter. I let them know as well and they said that I would also likely have to pay it back because it was in fact an error. (RIP me) As it currently stands I was overpaid ~$5000 between the two companies. Here is where my question comes in: I have already paid taxes on both of these overpayments, but I understand I will have to pay back the gross amount to each company. Should I claim an extra allowance or two on my next few paychecks so as not to hurt my cashflow since I will practically end up in the red for the month of October? I currently claim 0 on my taxes (I know this is also probably not the best option but I had a 6 month period a few years ago when I accidentally claimed I was exempt from paying federal taxes and had a REALLY bad April) so as it stands now I will probably get a sizable return anyways and I have some shorter term saving goals I’d like to focus on. Really just looking to see if anyone has experience with this and can tell me what I should be expecting.

Secondly, I have about $3000 in a 401k from my first job that I’m planning on rolling over because it’s in a managed account and I don’t think the fees will be worth it if I’m not contributing. My new company offers a 401k, but does not offer any matching. Technically the our HR director said that there is a possibility they will contribute something at the end of the year to the employees that choose to utilize the 401k but that’s dependent on performance and other factors like bonuses etc. From what I understand they have not contributed anything in the past. Should I focus solely on an IRA for my rollover and future contributions until I hit the limit and then potentially contribute a little bit to my 401k in case they decide to contribute something? Or is it not worth putting anything in a 401k at all?

Some context about my position and savings goals, I am 24 making 70k a year before bonuses. I have about 17k in student loans at 4% that I’m paying twice the minimum and am planning to contribute $10k to my wedding in early 2021. I have no car payment but will likely be financing a CPO passenger car sooner rather than later as the next large repair on my current car will be more than the car is worth. I am putting away money each month so I can put as much down as possible on this loan.

TL;DR - should I claim more allowances because I over paid taxes, should I contribute to an unmatched 401k?

Thanks so much!!",finance

personalfinance,What is the best way to manage my tax withholding?,"I’m a 29(F), single with minimal bills (total bills= ~45% of one paycheck- I get paid biweekly), 0 CC debt, and my only debt is my student loans (still a student, no payments at this time) and my car loan which is ~$8,400 (@ 4%). My next financial goal is to pay off my car as aggressively as possible (aiming for ~14 months starting in January). 

What I’d like to know is: being that I’m a single person, my federal withholding is (IMO) ridiculous (~$800/month, at 0 allowances). I’d like to somehow minimize that, so I can put the extra money towards paying off my car and/or putting it in my e-fund. Being that I’m a student, I get the student tax break (sorry, don’t know proper terminology for that!) which I believe is ~$2k-$2500. I’m okay with not getting any money back on my tax refund, or even owing a minimal amount (~$100 or less) if that means I get more money on my paychecks. 

Currently, I have my allowances set at 9 for the rest of the year. However, come January, I’d like to set my withholding up so that I don’t have to constantly change it like this year (from 0 allowances half the year to 9).  Is this something I’d have to talk to an accountant about, or is this something I can figure out on my own?

My salary is pretty stable, no significant bonuses, OT or pay raises that I foresee affecting my tax bracket (though I’m no expert, so I could be wrong). 

I’m genuinely interested in learning, and not just looking for a quick answer. Any advice (including whether or not this is a smart idea!) is much appreciated!! 


Also, I’m aware there is no exact science to taxes as it’s all based on percentages of your income. Again, zero refund to minimal payment when I file my taxes is what I’m aiming for. 

Thanks!!!!!",finance
personalfinance,Can I get late Federal Student Loan payments off of my credit report?,[deleted],finance
gaming,My Philosophy on how to (kinda) fight back against the Gambling Issue.,"# TL;DR: Loot Boxes are just Domesticated Lotteries. Always make a Budget for when you want to buy shit. When you see too many shitty rewards, just try and stop yourself. I Spend about 2+ Hours thinking, researching and typing it all down and My head is fried, but at least I tried to help people out and felt like I have done good.

&amp;#x200B;

Before we begin, we must first understand why do we do it? Why do we go for that one more Loot Box? Or why do we go for a Chance for that one Skin that you always wanted? And the Answer to that is our reaction with Dopamine. to put it simple, Dopamine is the Reaction of Happiness that we get as our positive response as our Emotional Reward. This can go from beating a boss that was either hard as fuck, or annoying, to randomly getting an expensive Item that you can use to sell for profit, going to use in the future, or even using it as a part of your collection. When Our Dopamine is Activated, it acts like a sense of Celebration for us, no matter how big or little the victory is. 

&amp;#x200B;

But when it comes to Loot Boxes, The Item should be based on Random. And Rarer the Item is, the ""Less"" Chances you will get from ever actually Achieving that Item that you wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Demanding Budget of Desensitization**:

Desensitization is the act of our Dopamine give you less and less of that Reward the more times you do it; making it less and less likely to give you a sense of satisfaction when you keep getting the stuff that you don't care or don't want. But when we do Finally get the Legendary Skin that we wanted, our Dopamine will burst out more, and the cycle is either finishes, or it continues the cycle until is it complete or if there is a halt. 

To give you an Example, Recently In Overwatch, I wanted  to get a few skins that I wanted to have. These being: Slasher: 76, Viking Torbjorn, and Brigiette's Shield Bash Highlight Intro.  If I had 100 Loot Crates, The Chances of me getting all 3 of the 2 Skins and the Highlight Intro that i wanted, would be a lot lower than being more fair and asking for at least one of the 3 Values that I wanted. 

I Did Happen to get Brigitte's Highlight Intro, and I was happy. However, I didn't manage to get Viking Torbjorn Skin despite me having enough Credits to buy it. That was personally my own fault from simply not buying the skin when I had the Chance, but I forgot about it or that I was too busy with something else. But it was Slasher: 76 that was going to give me the most Dopamine, because not only that I know that I'm going to use the skin a lot more, but it's also A Skin that I am more Passionate to obtain. At the end of the Day, I didn't manage to get it, and I felt sad that I didn't get. 

There is always next time when it comes to Overwatch, but that Next time is either to spend your money into having more chances of getting Slasher: 76 before you have to wait for the event to come again, or you can be Patient, and wait for the 1000 Credit Discount because the Skin was old enough to come back to Next Hallowe'en or Anniversary Event. **The Majority of People prefer to get what they want when they have the chance to do it**, because they might as well, when they have the illusion that they still have that chance of still getting it. And to spend all that money to get Slasher:76 is all of a sudden worth around 12K Credits or more when it comes to Overwatch's Currency compare to how many Loot Boxes you spend just to get that 1 Spefic Skin that you wanted. Instead of getting Slasher 76, I instead gotten Witch Mercy, and A Legendary Treasure Chest; which is basically a rip-off of  it's original counterpart, because it should have giving me 1000 Credits, not lower, like 500.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the **Demanding Budget of Desensitization** comes in, because sooner or later, you need to cut the wire to stop spend in order to start saving up for the Future. Either that, or if you could Temporarily quit Overwatch for a few day or even weeks, because of the amount of grind that your Put felt meaningless for you, and making you want to say 'No, fuck you. I have been working hard, and grinding to get Slasher: 76, and All I've been getting is nothing but Sprays, Icons, Voicelines, and Skins that I've already gotten or that I don't want.'

&amp;#x200B;

\-

&amp;#x200B;

 Now to be Fair, The Game doesn't know what Skin you're going to have, or what you want, and it's probably not going to give you the one thing that you truly want. That's where if we were to work all together and punish them Financially, by either not buying anything with our money, or  to even straight up quitting the game for a few days or even weeks, it's going to hurt both the game and the Business Financially. Unfortunately enough, I am only but one man. And even Hundreds upon Hundred of people were to quit, would act like as if the Business would only feel just lost their lunch money. If we were to Respond Accordingly, then the Business would be all like: ""ooh, shit."" and they would need to react. Unfortunately, we're not working together enough, or we tend to work together rightfully so, but for the wrong reasons. We're tend strike back because we're just simply pissed off about it, but not striking because we're fed up, and we're sick and tired of their bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately to our prior Unfortunates, The Developers can still fire back even more, because they are the ones who have switched the Machine On, and if they all have the balls to do it, or if they have no choice but to do it, They can shut down the game that we love, and usually but secretly give us an Article that said: ""Fuck you, and thanks for the money.""

This only Occurs when we either punish them too much; such us not enough Consumers, or not enough Profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what else can we do try and prevent the gambling to over our money? We need to Adapt to fight back against Loss Aversion. We hate losing more then we love winning, because we are programmed to try and become and do better. When we lose, we tend to try again, but we keep going down the rabbit hole of losing more of our profit then gaining anything as long as we keep spending, and this is why Loss Aversion is hard to stop. Because we don't know what's inside that loot crate, it could be a Legendary, so we buy another one, and get sprays and voice lines, and we keep trying. Over, and over and over again, up until we get what we want, or we want More of our Rewards. If we were to however make a complete and sudden halt for seeing too many crappy rewards, we can learn from our mistakes to go for Less turns then we are to go for more. And we do the Exact same thing, for when we are going in Competitive Mode. When we go in a Losing streak from us being too tilted or too toxic or even simply just losing too many times, we need make our own Strikes for when we should stop playing in general and to come back another day, or otherwise we just going to make a big snowball that's going to spell Disaster for us.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, to Recap all that I've typed down; We need to make an Adapting Budget for when we should actually stop at, compare to stopping when we reach our Treshhold. Because this is how the Game Business makes their money. They Exploit the Idea of the Threshold, and they give you little rewards to make you feel special in return for you to keep spending even more. So **BE. CAREFUL.**",technology

&gt;If you have attained the later of age 62 or your Plan's normal retirement age, your account will be liquidated and a cash distribution will be made to you in the form of a check. As required by federal tax law, 20% of the taxable portion of your distribution will be withheld (state tax withholding may also apply).  
&gt;  
&gt;If you have not yet attained the later of age 62 or your Plan's normal retirement age, your account will be distributed as follows:  
&gt;  
&gt;If your balance is less than or equal to $1,000, a cash distribution will be made to you in the form of a check. As required by federal tax law, 20% of the taxable portion of your distribution will be withheld (state tax withholding may also apply). If your balance is greater than $1,000, the Plan provides that your vested account balance be rolled over to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) at Fidelity Investments. Your rollover will be placed in the Fidelity Cash Reserves fund until you provide other direction. Important additional information for participants with Roth and non-Roth balances (Roth may not be offered by your plan):  
&gt;  
&gt;The $1,000 rollover limit is applied separately to the Roth and non-Roth balances. If either your Roth balance or your non-Roth balance is equal to or less than $1,000, you will receive a check for that balance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Example 1) if your account has a $2,000 balance comprised of $1,500 of non-Roth money and $500 of Roth money, you will receive a check for the $500 of Roth money, and the $1,500 of non-Roth money will be rolled over to an IRA  
&gt;  
&gt;Example 2) if your account has a $900 balance comprised of $400 of non-Roth money and $500 of Roth money, then you would receive two checks as each falls under the $1,000 limit to be automatically rolled over.  
&gt;  
&gt;Example 3) if your account has a $1,500 Roth balance and a $1,500 non-Roth balance, $1,500 will be rolled over to a traditional IRA and $1,500 will be rolled over to a Roth IRA.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because the value of your account can fluctuate changes in value prior to payment may change how your account is handled. The account balance on the automatic distribution date will determine if your account is to be cashed out or (if it exceeds the Plan's minimum) remain in the Plan - not the value of the vested account balance when this letter was issued.

BlockChain,Question Regarding the Design and Implementation of a Blockchain System,"Hi, I have a question regarding the capabilities of blockchain.

I'm attempting to understand the benefits and possibly propose the design of a permissionless private blockchain.   


The system is summered as follows: There are several databases involved all fed by various service providers. These different databases (each fed by their own discrete providers) have historically not been interoperable with one another. I would like to create a system where these databases are interoperable and data from one of them can inform data from another in service of an end user. 

The big question here is, if I have two databases that legally can't touch but I want them to be interoperable with read/write access. Is this possible on blockchain? Does blockchain allow databases to interact with out be touching. Can a user access both databases through a blockchain, but with out those databases touching.

Final question, if the answer is yes, can someone please explain to me how, both conceptually and from a technical standpoint. And if possible, please point me at where I can learn more and dig deeper.

personalfinance,"Might need to withdraw Roth IRA, some advice needed!","Hello there PF!

I'm currently debating if I should withdraw my Roth IRA. I have an account with Navy Federal, opened in 2016 I believe, with around $6,800 in it. I believe it has a 7 year maturity date... but I have no idea what that means. I have been unable to contribute this past year due to life changes. I do have a company 401k as well, which gets pretty close to max out every year. I think I'll hit around $15k this year

I am considering the withdraw due to my divorce, and having to pay out alimony next year. My take home pay most checks is $1,900 every two weeks, and my bills are around $1,500 a month (excluding credit card payments/food/fuel). I will be having to pay $1,600 a month in alimony, for one year, with a 13th payment of $800, for a total of $20,000.

I am currently in a position where I'll be able to save around $10,000 towards the alimony, so I will not have to pull from my paycheck income. Withdrawing the IRA would give me about $15,000 towards the alimony, making it so I will only have to pull $5,000 from my take home pay.(Pending my tax return as well, but I do have debts to pay as well).

Is withdrawing my roth a good idea/ plausible option? Does anyone know about what I would be looking at for taxes? I believe I've only gained about $300 since opening it a few years back? I won't be able to contribute over the next year either. I've done a bit of research, but I haven't been able to dissect the information well enough to get a an understandable answer. 

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks much!",finance
personalfinance,Using a 401K to Pay Down Credit Card Debt,"Over the past few years, I've been carrying a lot of credit card debt. I just got a significant salary increase and so I've been trying to aggressively pay them off before moving into a new apartment. This summer, when the salary increase went into effect, I had the following balances:

|Credit Card #1|$8500|
|:-|:-|
|Credit Card #2|$7500|
|Credit Card #3|$4000|

Since the salary increase back in July, I've completely paid off CC#2. I can make payments of $1750 per paycheck (I get paid every two weeks) but things get tight. At this rate, it would take me just over 7 paychecks to pay this off. So far I've been pretty disciplined, but it is weighing on me psychologically to cut huge checks that only marginally move the needle on my debts.

I'm wondering if it might make sense to take a loan out against my 401K to help pay this off quicker. The 401K at my current job has a vested balance of $13K and I can borrow up to 50% at 5.25% APR. Since this is definitely better than my current interest rate on either card and I'm not missing out on any short term growth (as the markets have stalled or been falling recently), it seems like the right thing to do. I would be locking in a loss of approximately $1K (which i guess would only be $500 since I'm taking out 50%.

I would then aggressively increase me contribution rate to pay back the loan. In the meantime, i don't think I can make any contributions above the repayments. However, I figure I'd just increase contributions to my separate IRA.

I don't believe this is taxable income, so I shouldn't get hit with a big bill in a couple of months. I also have a good bit of job security and a severance if I'm laid off (which could go to paying back the loan).

Is there something I'm missing?",finance

personalfinance,Questions about a Heloc,"My husband and I are planning on getting a Heloc. Our original reason for getting a Heloc is because we need to get a new roof, rewire our home and do some other work on our house. This shouldn't be terribly expensive - maybe $12,000 total. I would like a Heloc because it is flexible. Once we pay down the $12,000, I'd like to reno a couple of rooms. If we already have a Heloc, we can just use the Heloc.

My husband wants to roll a lot of our debt over onto the Heloc. We've accrued some credit card debt, about $8,000 I think. He wants to put it on the Heloc - not to pay if off really slowly, but for the lower interest rate. He intends to pay the Heloc off as quickly as possible. He is also talking about putting all of his tax return and yearly bonus towards the Heloc, and then paying our minivan off with the Heloc. He says we got a bad deal when we bought our minivan because our credit was bad at the time, so the interest rate is high. He feels like he could put the minivan on the Heloc and then pay the same amount currently being paid for the van + more and do better at paying off the amount?

Does it make sense to consolidate our debt onto the Heloc? I am very unsure about putting the van on it - but is it okay if we continue making decent payments, not just paying as little as possible?

personalfinance,Reversing a Delinquent Note on a Credit Account - is this possible?,"I have a 100% payment history, but I started on a Debt Management Plan with Greenpath in September. I have 3 creditors on my plan and had to pay Greenpath for all 3 creditors at once, so I couldn't make the minimum payment on the accounts themselves by the due date. (If I could have, I probably wouldn't have needed to go on the DMP anyway.) 

2 of the 3 creditors were fine with this, 1 was not. They said I still had to keep my account current, and after calling and explaining why I coudn't make the min. payment, they said too bad for you. Now, I know you're thinking why couldn't I just come up with the money to pay the balance? Maybe I could have, but I also have debts with 2 other creditors NOT on the DMP, outstanding 2017 taxes, medical bills (I had 3 ER visits and a week+ inpatient admission at the end of May 2018), and basic living expenses (utilities, food/gas for car, phone, insurance, rent, parking etc). I also moved into a new apartment and had no furniture other than an old TV (left a long relationship and am starting from the roots up). I chose to furnish some basic home supplies/seating/bed. 

Fast forward - my credit score declined 126 points today because of this delinquent account. I think I have it figured out how to pay the full minimum (amount I pay to third party debe management agency + leftover) by the due date, but **is there any way to reverse the delinquent flag on my credit report?** I called the creditor's collections department, but they said there was nothing they could do (I even cried on the phone). 

And yes, I effed up my finances pretty bad in my 20s. I'm trying to repair the damage and get out of debt now. Since I started on that path, I have been fired from my job, gone through a breakup (and lost my good boye doggo \*omg the pain still\*), got super sick and was finally diagnosed with a serious illness, been in and out of the hospital, while working 2 jobs to make ends meet. Yes, I follow r/frugal and r/EatCheapAndHealthy. I rarely eat out. I don't have home internet to try to save money. I have gone to the food pantry when things get rough. I do love my jobs and am doing really well in them (after almost being fired again when I was really sick because I couldn't focus on doing my job well), so please don't recommend trying to find a better job that pays more. My current jobs have great health insurance (MUCH needed rn) and are setting me up for upward career movement. In the long run, a little less money now is better for my future.

**My questions:**

Am I totally screwed with a 506 credit score (was 632 before today)? 

If I get my one account current and keep all other accounts current, how long will it take to get back to 632? 

Is there anything I can do to improve my credit score outside of my credit card debt? 

Other things to note: no student loans, no car payments, rent (don't own home) 12 mos lease, no kids/pets/dependents, make too much for food stamp benefits, I applied for/was approved for community assistance on my medical bills but I still have a balance I'm paying off, taxes left are around $175.",finance

personalfinance,I finally took control of my finances for the first time in my adult life [30M] Looking for more things I can do to improve.,"A little bit of background on me. I make a good salary at almost 70k but I was finding myself dead broke half way into each pay pay every single month. I was racking up a 5-10 NSF fee's each month and then mindlessly using my credit cards when I was out of money in my bank account. I was also mindlessly spending money on food and things from Amazon with no disregard to my account.

It felt so overwhelming to come up with a ""budget"" or be one of those ""spreadsheet people"" but I finally did it. I have had one too many close calls with not being able to pay my $1,000 rent because my balance was so negative leading up to the 1st. I ended up borrowing money a lot from my S/O just to cover things. 

Here are some things I did but I want to learn more about the discipline of money management.

The first thing required is what absolutely sucked the most and kept keeping me from starting time and time again. I had to go through all my bank statements and credit card statements to figure out exactly what was billing me and write that down somewhere. I decided on a Google Doc. It took days upon days as I hated doing it and the spreadsheet I came up with was absolutely butt ugly with random colored blocks and no organization. I also had to reset a lot of passwords and tidy up my LastPass but now I had a starting point of Bill type, Company Name, Due Date, Statement Date, Auto-Pay Status, Payment Method, and URL. 

The process got easier and easier as I hummed along. Here are some of the things I did.

1. Disabled each and every one of my auto-payments. 90% of them I could do online, a few I had to call, and a few I surprisingly found out I could not disable at all -&gt; Google Fi cell phone service. This took another several days as well and basically sucks. It is well worth it though.
2. Cancelled a TON of unneeded services and subscriptions. Things I literally never use. Hulu, Evernote, Stupid things that I signed up for a free trial and just let them bill me endlessly. 
3. Paid my bills manually for the first time ever! My spreadsheet sucked and really slowed down the process. 
4. I re-made the spread sheet and broke it into two halves. Bills due 1st-14th and bills due 15-31st. My plan is to twice a month, the 1st and 15th, log into each site and just submit a payment for what's due after reviewing the statement. (I never reviewed statements before!.)
5. I can now add up the costs of what my compulsory bills are for each half of the month and see how much money I should have left for all other expenses that are not bills. When I add up both halves I actually have over $1,700 dollars left to budget for the entire month. I know this can get eaten up quick by food, gas, and other expenses but at least I have a good number now. 
6. I signed up for YNAB to manage the day to day spending and it is awesome. This really is helping me budget for what I have and not what I might have. 

Some stuff I am doing now

1. Added a YNAB category called Stupid Spending and now track all of the stupid things I have spent money on that I want to cut off. I keep a second tab in the spreadsheet called Spending reduction plan to figure out where I can cut service costs or make a plan to stop stupid spending. 
2. Figuring out what my one month's cost of living is and start working towards saving the one months paycheck buffer. My goal is to have all my money for the month and log in on the 1st and pay every single one of my bills! Psychological freedom!
3. Start saving for retirement and a 6-month income saved. This seems daunting at nearly $30,000 for the 6-months of income. 
4. Stopping impulse buying and fast food purchases. It hurts a lot more when you're spending your own cash and not just a credit card.
5. Stop adding more to my credit cards!
6. Added another spreadsheet tab with all my credit card balances, interest rates, and how much I was being charged for interest. I was surprised to find them as high as $70 in interest!!
7. Begin prioritizing paying off the card pegging me for the most interest dollars a month, and then the next, and the next. 

Now that I have the spreadsheet and YNAB I feel like I'm actually steering the ship. 

It's an amazing feeling to know that all your bills are paid and nothing else will be automatically billing you and over drafting your account. I actually received a one time medical bill today and I was able to immediately login with confidence in myself and pay it and add it to YNAB.  

Long time budgeters and financiers please give me advice, tips or material to read to learn more!

personalfinance,How to make the most of my current situation.,"Hi,

Little info about myself: living in central/eastern europe (depends on your point of view), 25, male, single, no serious attachments to friends and family (except my parents and brother), have a ""sporty car"", managed to snag stable office job right out of high-school, moved up the corporate ladder in the last 4 years, now I get above average pay for my area (average is around 550€ per month, I take home 850€ per month). Still live with my parents (I send them 100€ every month), spend around 100€ on gas monthly, all in all I can usually save 500-600€ every month, some of it I later spend on travel or other hobbies. I have around 20k € saved up, in a year or two I could buy my own apartment (25-28k€ for a 2 bedroom, 30-35k€ for a 3 bedroom in a small town of around 15k people) without going into debt. I know I will never make big money if I stay here (aiming for a 10% raise in a month or two), that's why I'm considering giving up everything and moving somewhere else. On the other hand, living expenses are not that bad around here, if I had my own place I could probably manage to spend around 150€ on utilities, 150-200€ on food and 50€ on gas (depends on where I move to) every month. A different alternative is getting a 20-30k€ mortgage with around a 1.5% interest rate (last I checked) and investing the money I have saved up, but that's way above my abilities right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost every single person I talk to just tells me to go, experience the world, then come back and settle down. I don't know if it's their regret talking, or is it really the best choice for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm okay at English, my CV looks pretty good for someone my age, I'm a pretty fast learner, but I don't have any real education and I feel that could hold me back.

&amp;#x200B;

As for work, it would be really hard for me to move somewhere and clean dishes or fishing tanks for a living, I got used to some level of comfort here in the last 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Now if I decide to move, there are some obvious choices like Canada, Singapore, Switzerland, New Zealand, but these are not the easiest to get into (Switzerland probably the easiest since it's in Schengen).

stocks,"Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for the week beginning November 5th, 2018","Hello traders of the r/stocks sub!

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 5th, 2018.

# **Stocks fall after wild session as conflicting trade news keeps investors guessing** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/02/stock-market-triple-digit-gains-for-dow-nonfarm-payrolls.html)*
*****
&gt; Stocks traded in a wide range on Friday as investors digested different comments and reports on global trade, while Apple shares dented the broader tech sector.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 109.91 points lower at 25,270.83 after falling 300 points earlier in the session. At its session high, it was up as much as 198.24 points. The S&amp;P 500pulled back 0.7 percent to 2,723.06 as Apple's 6.6 percent decline dragged down other major tech names like Facebook and Alphabet. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1 percent to end the day at 7,356.99.
*****
&gt; The major indexes pared some of their losses after President Donald Trump told reporters the U.S. and China are much closer to striking a deal on trade, saying the two countries will have a good deal in place.
*****
&gt; Trump's comments come after Larry Kudlow, his top economic advisor, told CNBC there is no trade plan in the works for China. ""There's no massive movement to deal with China,"" Kudlow told CNBC's ""Halftime Report. "" ""We have already put out asks to China with respect to trade.""
*****
&gt; ""We're doing a normal, routine run-through of things that we've already put together and normal preparation,"" he said. ""We're not on the cusp of a deal."" When asked whether the president explicitly requested his top advisors to drum up a trade deal, Kudlow said ""no."" Kudlow's comments sent equities to their lows of the day.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Kudlow's remarks contradicted a Bloomberg report from earlier on Friday that said Trump had asked officials to prepare a draft for a U.S.-China trade deal.
*****
&gt; ""It's still all about trade,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""Most of the trading we're seeing is related to earnings or trade.""
*****
&gt; ""The recent moves we're seeing are reflect a return to more historical levels of volatility,"" said Kinahan. ""I don't think this will abate.""
*****
&gt; Apple fell after the company's iPhone shipments for last quarter missed estimates. The company also offered light guidance and announced major changes to its reporting structure. These were enough to overshadow stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue.
*****
&gt; Stocks initially surged after the Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 250,000 jobs last month. Economists polled by Refinitiv expected an addition of 190,000. Wages, meanwhile, rose 3.1 percent on an annualized basis in October for the first time since the recession.
*****
&gt; ""Today's stronger than expected October employment report was a mixed bag for stocks,"" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. ""On the positive side, strong job growth will allay fears of slowing economic growth. However, with wages up 3.1 percent year over year … it will be more difficult for the Fed to slow its rate hiking campaign.""
*****
&gt; Investors are worried that rising wages and increasing inflationary pressures will push the Federal Reserve to raise rates at a faster pace than expected. The central bank has hiked rates three times this year and is forecast to raise them once more before year-end.
*****
&gt; ""There's good news for everyone in this report, but it also makes it clear that the economy is running a little bit faster than we can probably sustain,"" said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark. ""The Fed must, and is trying to, slow down the economy"" so growth remains sustainable.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields rose following the data's release. The benchmark 10-year note yield traded around 3.21 percent while the two-year yield climbed to 2.91 percent and hit its highest level in a decade.

# Good Riddance, October

&gt; Well, it’s a good thing that October is over. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index lost 6.9%, for the worst month since September 2011.

&gt; Here are some of the highlights—or lowlights—from the month:

&gt; * Besides being the worst month for the S&amp;P 500 in seven years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 5.1% for its worst month since January 2016, while the Nasdaq’s -9.2% return marked its worst month since November 2008. The big loser was small caps though, as the Russell 2000 Index fell 10.9%, its worst month since September 2011.

&gt; * The six-month win streak for the S&amp;P 500 is officially over. Want some good news? Since 1990, it has had 10 other 6-month win streaks, and the index was higher every single time 12 months later, up 13.6% on average.

&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 fell 16 days during the month, tying the most down days for any one month since October 2008.

&gt; * The first back-to-back up days for the S&amp;P 500 took place on the final two trading days of the month, with the index gaining more than 1% each day. This occurred nearly right on cue, as the end of the month tends to see the best moves.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stocks-tend-to-bounce-the-last-part-of-october.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; * In fact, the S&amp;P 500 had gone 28 consecutive trading days without back-to-back up days. As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, that tied the longest streak going back to the Great Depression. That sums up how persistent the selling has been recently.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/this-tied-the-longest-streak-without-back-to-back-up-days-since-the-great-depression.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; * After not a single 1% move up or down during the entire third quarter, the S&amp;P 500 saw 10 changes of at least 1% up or down last month. That was the most for any month since 12 changes back in February 2018. October even had four changes of at least 2%, for the most since January 2016.

&gt; * Lastly, turning to the Dow, in terms of the cumulative intraday range for the Dow during October, it moved a total of 9,872 points. Only February 2018 and October 2008 had larger movements.

&gt; “October was a rough ride, and most investors are likely quite happy to wave it goodbye. The good news remains that valuations are the lowest they’ve been in years, earnings continue to surprise to the upside, and November and December during a midterm year are historically quite strong,” summarized LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

# A Silver Lining

&gt; It’s been a rocky ride so far in October, but there is a silver lining. “Incredibly, the S&amp;P 500 during a midterm year has never finished lower if you bought the October low and held till the end of the year,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; Of course, no one can pick a market low with any consistency, but with October about to end, it is safe to assume the low happened last week or will happen over the next few days.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the past 18 midterm years saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain from the October lowest close until the end of the year every single time—up 10.6% on average. Given the average year since 1950 is up 7.4% on average from the October lows, midterm years can see even more strength to end the year.

# November Kicks Off the “Best Months”

&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. The month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-three DJIA (since 1950) and NASDAQ (since 1971) month. November is second best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 2000 (since 1979). November is the Russell 1000’s best month (since 1979).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ecf3f65936f368406442f83e6867c3cd/tumblr_inline_ph7z8tWpgo1spdppr_400.jpg))**

&gt; In midterm years, November’s market prowess is relatively unchanged. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 midterm years since 1950 with an average gain of 2.5%. S&amp;P 500 has also been up in 13 of the past 17 midterm years, gaining on average 2.6%. Small-caps perform well with Russell 2000 climbing in 6 of the past 9 midterm years, averaging 3.5%. The only real blemish in the November midterm-year record is 1974 (DJIA –7.0%, bear market ended in December).

# Best and Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks on Earnings

&gt; Below is a list of the best performing S&amp;P 500 stocks on their earnings reaction days so far this season. Under Armour (UAA) ranks at the very top of the list with a huge one-day gain of 27.71% after it reported a triple play on October 30th. (A triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises guidance.)

&gt; Vulcan Materials (VMC) ranks second with a gain of 17.49%, followed by Akamai Tech (AKAM), Newfield Exploration (NFX), and Twitter (TWTR). Other notables on the list of big winners this earnings season include International Paper (IP), Ford (F), PayPal (PYPL), Church &amp; Dwight (CHD), Starbucks (SBUX), General Motors (GM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), DowDuPont (DWDP), and Whirlpool (WHR). These certainly aren’t your typical high-fliers!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/beststocksonearnings.png))**

&gt; On the downside, Mohawk (MHK) has been the worst performer this earnings season with a one-day decline of 23.86% after it reported a reverse triple play on October 25th. The stock missed EPS estimates, missed revenue estimates, and lowered guidance.

&gt; Align Tech (ALGN) ranks second worst with a one-day decline of 20.2%, followed by Western Digital (WDC), Advanced Micro (AMD), and United Rentals (URI). Other notables on the list of losers include Equifax (EFX), Fortinet (not to be confused with the video game Fortnite!), Fortune Brands (FBHS), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Kellogg (K), General Electric (GE), AT&amp;T (T), and Amazon (AMZN).

# The Jekyll and Hyde Earnings Season

&gt; In the early part of the current earnings reporting period that began back on October 12th, stocks couldn’t sniff a bid on their earnings reaction days. Since Monday, however, investors have been busy buying up stocks after they report.

&gt; Below we show how stocks within sectors performed on their earnings reaction days from the start of earnings season through the morning of October 29th. We also show how stocks have performed on their earnings reaction days since the close on the 29th. As shown, for all stocks that have reported, the average stock fell 0.91% on its earnings reaction day through October 29th. Since then, the average stock that has reported has gained 1.56% on its earnings reaction day. That’s a huge shift in sentiment around earnings reports. Investors have flipped from selling the news to buying the news.

&gt; There have been some interesting trends within sectors as well. Health Care, Materials, Energy, Technology, Consumer Staples, and Industrials stocks that reported got hit the hardest prior to the 29th. Since then, the cyclical sectors of this group (all of them except for Consumer Staples) have seen stocks fly higher by 1.3% or more on their earnings reaction days, while Consumer Staples stocks that have reported since the 29th have actually declined. Utilities and Communication Services stocks have averaged very small declines on their earnings reaction days over both time frames. Finally, Consumer Discretionary stocks have been a positive outlier throughout earnings season. Discretionary stocks that reported prior to the 29th bucked the trend and averaged gains on their earnings reaction days. And since the 29th, they’ve continued to see gains, averaging a one-day change of +2.1%.

personalfinance,Credit Score dropped from 860 to 682. Any advice?,"\*\*\*So a bunch of people have sarcastically congratulated me on having an 860 credit score. I honestly thought it was an 860.  If it only goes up to 850, then it was an 840 maybe.  It was an honest mistake.  I've included pics in this update to show you one year back and how my score dropped after selling my house (In September) and then the one missed payment I discuss in this post. It only goes back a year, so the scores over 800 are no longer visible on this report.

[https://imgur.com/Kgn3CWV](https://imgur.com/Kgn3CWV)

[https://imgur.com/qEdP1z1](https://imgur.com/qEdP1z1)

\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I did everything right.  Over a decade, I paid off all of my credit card debt, two cars, my wife's student loans, and my credit score jumped up to an 860 (I think that was the highest). I bought a house and got the lowest interest rate available at the time. I even had a back up plan in case of unexpected change.  Kept building my savings. Paid my bills on time.

Then I unexpectedly lost my job. I put the plan into action. Decided to move cross country to an area with a lower cost of living.  Sold my house, moved back east, lived with family while I looked for a new job.

I finally got a job and the next part of the plan was to buy a house. This is where I realized I had a problem. As it turns out, after more than 10 years without a missed or late payment, my wife and I had somehow ""forgotten"" to pay our last electric bill of about $200.  We only found out about it after receiving a letter from a collections agency. We mailed in the payment and I checked my score.

My credit score score had dropped to 682 in less than a year.  It looks like after we sold the house, the score dropped from 860 to about 780.  Then after this missed bill, it dropped down to 682.

I talked to the electric company and explained that something obviously went wrong, because being 8 months delinquent on a bill didn't match our history with them OR with any creditor.  They responded by telling me that they had not only mailed us two large envelopes we ""couldn't miss"", and had records of 8 different attempts to call us about this outstanding bill.  They even claim to have records that my wife answered 2 of the calls (to her number), and that they left 6 voicemails.  They say this was all BEFORE they sent us to collections. The man on the phone refused to listen to (what I consider to be ) logic.  It just doesn't make sense for someone to just suddenly ignore a bill.

I have no question that this bill was missed. After the chaos of a cross country move (with two kids), I'm honestly surprised nothing else slipped through the cracks. I just can't explain HOW it was missed for so long. We never got any of their letters. My wife's phone history shows no record of calls or voicemails.

I disputed the claim with Transunion and they ruled that the negative mark was accurate and would remain on my report.

Does anyone have any advice?  What can I do here? Do I have any options?  I want to buy a house,  but with interest rates slowly climbing, the difference between the payment on a 4.8% apr, and a 5.8% apr is pretty drastic. In fact, it's throwing my back up plan into a tailspin.

Sorry for the length of this post.  I just wanted to put in as many details as I could.  I really hope someone has any advice, or recommendation other than ""sorry bud, you're screwed,"" or ""wait it out, the score will go back up.""

Thanks.

So, if someone lives in a non-income tax state like texas, and for whatever reason their income is exempt (it is but it qualifies to be exempted), where should they invest extra money?


A 401k is an obvious investment vehicle because of matching, but the disadvantage as funds are ""locked up"" and penalty for withdraw.

I am currently in graduate school and still haven't fully paid off my undergraduate loans. In total, after I graduate I will have a little less than $40k in school loans. I honestly don't know what the job market holds for me in the future (I'm getting an MPH and it's common knowledge that there's not much money in public health, but I do think I can get a job making somewhere between $40-60k. 

Beyond that, I was driving a 1998 Honda Accord and my plan was to buy a newer used car when I graduated and could have the job security to make payments on it. Well last week my car died and the repairs were wayyyyy more than the worth of the car (car was worth $275) so I bought a 2015 Honda Fit. My car payments now are $199 which is affordable for me (I work several jobs and money for the first time is somewhat stable, but my jobs will end when I graduate as I am a research assistant). 

I also have a credit card which I was doing a really good job paying off (I paid off $1500 of a $2000 debt so I'm really close to finishing paying it off) and I always make larger payments than my statements. 

Basically I need advice on how to go about paying all my debts once I graduate. Should I just go ahead and pay off my credit card so I can focus on my car payments (interest rate is 5.25% and the loan is $12,210)? How do my student loans figure into all of this?

personalfinance,I would like some advice regarding US Government savings bonds and what I can do with them.,"Hello Personal Finance,

Like the title says I have some questions regarding savings bonds. It has recently dawned on me that these bonds that I have may be making less money than they could be.

For a little back story, when I was little for birthdays and Christmas various relatives would get me US Savings bonds as presents. The bonds range from 50-100 dollar denominations(There are also a few Patriot bonds[EE] in there as well, which I believe behave differently than I class bonds), and their interest rates also vary quite a bit. Some of the bonds have a 2.06% interest rate, and others are 3.68%. I got them throughout my childhood, so some bonds are 19 years into their maturity, and others are 7. I was wondering a few things.

1.) I tried to forecast what my bonds would be worth in Excel but couldn't quite figure out how to get it to work, does anyone know of any good resources to help with that? (with the sheet I was trying to make I wanted to be able to figure out how much a certain bond would be worth in year X, but I'm not adept enough at Excel to make that work)

2.) If I were to cash in the bonds that have the low interest rates (I'm assuming 2.06% isn't that great?) what are some options that I can look into that might earn me more on the money I cashed out? I've really only heard of a Vanguard account but I'm sure there's other options out there.

3.) The amount of money is between 2,000 and 5,000 dollars. I don't really want to give out specifics so hopefully that can help you judge a few things, or give more pointed advice.

In short, I *think* (and they key word here is think) that I could be earning more money on some of these bonds, and I'm wondering if that's true, and if that is true, what avenues I should pursue to make it happen.

Also, I apologize if this sounds like I'm asking you all to do the work for me, that's not my intention, I just don't know much about this stuff, so I'm pretty lost. If more information would help I'll certainly add more detail if it's necessary.",finance
investing,If average interest rates are historically ~7%...,"Then how in the hell can we ever expect to return to this rate with current US debt sitting at 21 trillion (from what I just read, 
 as of late Oct. that count is closer to 21.6 trillion)?
  
Is it just me or are current debt levels only sustainable because of record low interest rates? At 2.00% interest, annual interest repayments on debt sits at 420 billion. At 7.00% that number rises dramatically to almost 1.5 trillion. 
  
Da fuq?
  
With the fed controlling interest rates they'll never allow that to happen (unless of course they've understated the effects of what QT might do) but the point remains...does this mean interest rates can effectively never return to their historical average, or anywhere near them for that matter?
  
In a slightly related topic, can anyone explain how the US government serviced debt in the 1980's with record high interest rates? I'm having trouble googling it!

Edit: I made a fairly glaring mistake. ""Only"" 15.8 trillion of the national debt is held by the public, the rest is money the government owes itself. That's still interest payments of 316 at current rates vs 1.1 trillion at 7.00%. At 5% it's still almost 800 billion.",finance

I looked up my credit score, fully expecting it to be non-existent.  Instead, it shows a score just under 600.  The last major item was a $15,000 loan when I bought my car about 8 years ago - shows all payments made and account closed. Again, I have paid cash for most everything, instead using the ATM card and online banking for anything that might need a credit card.  I have read that having a credit card will boost my score.  With that in mind, I am thinking of a card and looking for advice. 

Q1: Is there a low interest rate card you would recommend?

Q2: Is it better for credit report purposes to carry a small balance and then pay it off - like let it go a month and pay half, then pay the other half the following month? Or charge and pay in full when the bill comes?

Q3: Or should I disregard the credit card advice and just go for the home loan with the low credit score, but no debt?

I have an 06 Altima second owner with 95k miles. Just got it re-registered in Florida. I was dumb at the time and was told I needed to buy a car that week by my command so I went to the Toyota dealership and bought it for about 8k with a 2.3 apr loan from Navy Federal credit Union. Still owe 5k on it. The model is worth about 3k on Craiglist.

I'm getting married soon with my fiance from overseas and then I'm due for a PCS. So not a great time. However I have 11k in the bank between checking and savings accounts. I was hoping to have 10k in saving before getting married but I guess I have to bite the bullet. 

I estimate an engine change including labor will run me 3k-3.5k dollars. I hope to get some sort of warranty with it but I don't know how that works. Or I could junk this car, pay off they loan or roll it into another loan to buy another car. In that case should I go used again, or should I lease? Not sure what to do. Also depending where we are stationed we might need to get my wife a car for her to move around and commute. I'm an enemy of buying new and getting 20k in debt although she thinks it's worth it to avoid issues.

So my 4 options:

1. Replace engine for 3-3.5k
2. Junk car and pay off loan, buy another used car.
3. Roll over loan into buying a buy more expensive used car
4. Pay off loan and Lease a car.

2. Car loan of 5k

financialindependence,FIRE and Healthcare (Marketplace / Medicaid / CHIP),"Hey all,

One of the ""benefits,"" as I see it, of being a self-employed person is that I can manipulate my AGI / MAGI by $37,000 (18.5k each for both myself and my wife) + 20% of our net business income each year by maximizing our i401(k) contributions, plus another $11,000 if we contribute to our IRAs.

Since the inception of the Healthcare Marketplace, and with it the steady increase of our insurance premiums, I've decided to lean hard on those i401(k) contributions to bring our MAGI down to the point where our insurance premium are as low as possible.  This saves us \~15k in premiums as a family of 4, which as I see it frees up more money to save and invest in our budget and also happens to reduce our taxable income for a lower total tax.  I feel like I'd be throwing that 15k+ away if we *didn't* do things this way.

This year in going through the Marketplace, however, I found that anytime I moved our MAGI below $75,300 (300% Federal Poverty Level) it said that our 2 children should be eligible for our state's CHIP.  When I spoke to our state agency in past years, they told me that their eligibility determinations were based on your *total* income (1040 line 22) not your AGI / MAGI, but looking through their current documentation it looks as though they're (now) using MAGI just like the Federal Marketplace does.  Perhaps it's a recent change as Medicaid / CHIP programs are expanded state-by-state.

In any case, I'm not thrilled at the idea of our children being on CHIP, as I've found things run through our state's agency extremely slow-moving and confused, and as such I take the next step and question the quality of care and potential headaches I'd have to deal with.  As I thought about it, though, I thought about the possibility of making contributions such that we move our MAGI just below 100% FPL ($25,100 for 2019).  It turns out that CHIP and our state's Medicaid plans include dental and other coverages that our Marketplace plan does not.

So, with that in mind, I have a few questions:

1. Do any of you have any experience living on a shoestring budget, maintaining a low MAGI and using Federal / State healthcare programs to save on the cost of healthcare as part of either your pursuit of FIRE or your RE lifestyle?
2. How do you feel in conscience about doing so?  Truthfully, I feel like I'm taking advantage of programs that were *not* designed for someone netting close to 100k/yr who's just choosing to go hard on their retirement contributions.
3. What's your experience been like in terms of finding providers, quality of care, and ease of getting benefits to cover what they're supposed to cover?  I don't feel like constantly being caught up in headaches trying to get things covered by being on an ill-managed state program.
4. This one's totally subjective, but I'm still interested in people's thoughts - is it *worth* it?  We have to keep a tight grip on our spending to make sure that we save enough to make these 401k / IRA contributions to in turn lower our MAGI to save on health care.  We could live a much freer more ""enjoyable"" lifestyle if we weren't doing this.  But saving 15k in premiums is a lot, and potentially getting totally free coverage from Medicaid / CHIP is potentially a boon, as well.

Thanks much.",finance

&gt;  
&gt;Surely every president has endured stories that he knew were inaccurate and has chaffed at one or more news publications. George  Washington was routinely brutalized by a newspaper that had been anonymously funded and founded by his own Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson. But no American president has ever before vilified the  American press or one of its professional outlets as an “Enemy of the  People.”  
   
&gt;  
&gt;Attacking the media or publications that lean in a different direction than the Republican Party is decidedly good politics. We conservatives have long suffered from the left-leaning attitudes and reporting of the media. But today, if we don’t like one outlet, there  are others from which we can—and do—choose. And, more importantly,  denigrating the media diminishes an institution that is critical to  democracy, both here and abroad. As a political tactic, it may be  brilliant, but it comes with a large cost to the cause of freedom.",finance

investing,How to correctly play VIX into Midterm election and FOMC meeting?,"**Just a disclaimer, im doing this for a national stock market competition. I just wanted to ask about this play**

The Midterm elections are looking insane in terms of volatility. If Repubs win, odds are VIX will go down and if Dems win odds are VIX will go up. I've dropped quite a bit in the rankings of our stock market competition, and since its coming to a close soon I decided to go full out in an effort to win as coming 30th and 1000th is the same, you're not first.

I believe Republicans will do better than expected yet still lose a few house seats, so I'm planning on shorting everything VIX (If they only lose a few seats but keep a majority I feel like VIX will still drop, am I correct?). 

In addition to this, the FOMC meeting is concluding this Thursday. Historically VIX drops going into the meeting, and goes up if they decide to raise interest rates. I was thinking I should hold my short until Thursday morning and flip all my positions since I believe they will continue their longterm plan to raise interest rates. Have I analyzed this correctly? Am I doing something stupid?

These are my plays before the election

Short

       TVIX

       VXX          
Long

Beyond interest/APR, what other charges/fees/credits are variable in a mortgage? What can I negotiate? Are there some fees that are charged by one lender, and not another? Are there any hidden fees that I can look out for? Do mortgage lenders provide incentives to choose their company over another?

personalfinance,Wife let me know of 26k credit card debt and now considering loan to consolidate everything,"I thought I finally had a handle on things. I had a plan to pay off my most troublesome credit cards in about 2 years. Then my wife told me she applied for a personal loan for 30k. I told her that was crazy and asked why. She then proceeded to tell me that the credit card she said only had 9k on it was actually closer to 20k. And then when pushed a little more she admitted it was actually 25.5k. We clearly have a problem. Now, the 30k loan doesn't sound so bad since she also has 4k for a dental loan she had to get for recent work. But, I'm wondering if I should just apply for a larger loan and just consolidate all of our debt instead of just her portion.


Our debt:



Card|Total|Interest


CC1 | 25.5k | 19%

CC2 | 4k | 0%

CC3 | 9.5k | 17.5%

CC4 | 6.5k | 21.21%

45k for a personal loan seems like a lot, she was already approved for 30k at 8.9% for 5 years. I don't know how that interest rate compares but I doubt we'll do a lot better considering our circumstances. If we got approved for the 45k we would split the payments and I'd contribute more whenever possible to get it paid as quickly as we can.


Does this sound like a good idea? Should I go for 45k or let her do 30k and continue with my plan to pay off the other 16k debt (CC3 and CC4) as I had originally planned? I'm getting really stressed out from thinking about this. I had not planned to be this far in the hole at this stage of my life.

personalfinance,To take out more student loans or have my employer pay for my education?,"I have a 4 year degree(Psychology) and graduated in 2015. I am not using the degree and currently have no desire to. I have been working since 2016 doing customer service/admin/operations/office manager for a small company. I am very lucky to have an amazing boss (Director of Operations) and owner who treat me very well and I get a lot of perks (lunch paid for, long lunches for therapy appts, extra PTO time, etc). 

I have recently decided that I need to put myself on a path to make more money, and I want to go back to school for Accounting. This is a field I was always interested in but kind of got caught up in it being a ""boring"" field. Now I see that it's something that I would enjoy and be good at and would have more job security. I am likely going to go to community college for 2 years to make sure this is what I want and then I plan to transfer. I know this could change.

The problem is how to pay for this. When I told my boss I was planning to go back to school she immediately said that they may be willing to pay for it, depending on a contract/agreement we would come up with (she threw out there, that they pay for 4 years and I would stay on 4 more years after). I'm not sure this is what I want. Most of the time I'm really happy at work. But some days it's truly terrible. In 2 years I've been there I've looked for a new job numerous times. There's another manager I work with who is UNBEARABLE. My boss has been encouraging the owner to fire him but I don't know if that will ever happen. (Believe me, him being fired is more than justified purely on work reasons). In addition, my boss routinely says ""I told you XYZ"" when she never did. I thought it was just me being forgetful but several times my co-worker said nope, you never said that. I wouldn't mind except then I get blamed for not remembering X was off today or not taking care of something. It's a lot of little things that add up. (It's also recently occurred to me that maybe I'm not as good at my job as I think, but she would have said so already, I've seen her do it).

I already have ~$50k in federal loans that I'm working on paying off and the idea of taking out more is really scary. On the other hand, the idea of being at this company for 8 years is also scary. If they paid for my education and I stayed on, a huge piece that I would want is taking on a majority accounting/finance role once I have my degree or close to. I can't see my boss giving that responsibility up, however, and she's made a remark of that type.

I feel stuck and confused and this doesn't seem to be a common issue that I've been able to Google since we're not a huge corporation with an existing education reimbursement policy.

I have been between private health insurance and Medi-Cal multiple times now which had caused some gaps in my coverage. Each treatment cost is about $20,000; So being caught without insurance, can be painful to my wallet and health if my 8 weeks are up and I'm due for treatment.

   I worked jobs off and on but haven't kept a consistent income to keep me confidently insured. The amount I need to be at the doctor or days I'm not feeling well doesn't always bode well with an employer, which makes keeping a job difficult.

She has been in the hospital for a few weeks now and doesn't seem to be improving.

I don't want to let go so easily and have been trying to think of anything I can to find out how to stay living here or purchase the house from them.

I have been able to save up close to 20k living rent free. My credit score is ~575. Zillow shows the house priced at about ~600k. It is a 4 bedroom, 2 bath.

   A friend mentioned to me about an FHA (Federal Housing Administration) loan, and now I feel more empowered than ever. Although I don't think I can make this happen unless I found co-borrowers, my income alone would not suffice. If I get some friends to live with me and pay rent and/or possibly become co-borrowers until I can refinance and fully own the place, that would be my ideal situation.

Can renting the 3 rooms while living in the 4th count towards my income?

I started as an intern in 2017 and through some full-time and part-time work in the department, they decided to offer me a job after the previous person in the position retired in July.

I lived on campus my first two years of college and racked up about 25K in student loans. \~$14K at 5.9% and \~11K at 4%. I was very, very immature with my spending. I am just now understanding the concept of delayed gratification, but this came too late. I have $12K in credit card debt with varying interest rates, most around 21% APR. About $3K of that came out of a gambling problem I have overcome entirely.

I love my job and am fortunate and grateful to live with my mom and brother in the house we grew up in, there is no pressure to move out. I am commuting to school now two nights a week, looking to to finish my degree in about 4 years. I pay my mom $320/month for all expenses. I bought my car last year and do not have a car payment.

1. I know I should tackle my debt first. I am going to build an emergency fund of a couple grand before I do that. Should I attack the highest interest cards first?
2. My job has a 401K but I cannot contribute until I am 21 next summer, my company offers a 3% match. Should I look into investing into a Roth IRA for now or attack all my debt before any investing? Should I wipe my CC debt then do my Roth as I start my student loan repayments in a couple years?

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I'm 35/M and been married to my wife for just over 10 years, we also have a son who is just over 2 years old.  We live in Texas.

Some additional background info...  When I first married, whom shall now be named Mary, things were great.  Her and I worked full time and with only about a year under our belts we moved into our first house.  We were just barely making enough money to make ends meet, not to mention the house needed some work.  Mary unfortunately has various mental and physical issues that have plagued her nearly since birth.  Things such as major depression, anxiety, OCD, a blood mutation disorder, an issue where half of her body's bone structure is slightly off which tends to cause physical pain, and a few other things that I probably I can't think of right now.  These issues have slowly worsened and caused her to work less and less over the course of the next couple of years.  She changed jobs a few times but eventually stopped officially working altogether.  For a few short years she helped a friend of her's ""under the table"" by help with small house work and computer things.  Mary had a lot of flexibility this way but it just wasn't enough income.  At one point even her sister live with us and we still scraped by a little longer.  After living about 8 years in the house and behind on mortgage payments it started going into foreclosure.  We made the decision to file bankruptcy.. can't remember if it was Chapter 7 or Chapter 10.  Essentially, we gave up our house and any other secured debt, but still got to keep our car thankfully.  Wouldn't you know it, she just happened to get pregnant about this time!  

We moved in with her parents to try to get back on our feet.  Unfortunately, about 6-7 months into Mary's pregnancy, her father passed.  Mary's mom can't live by herself due to her also having health conditions, so we have since been living here.   Things have of course been easier living here in terms of finances and raising our son, but things have gotten worse.

Now we can get to the more pressing matters happening now.  With Mary's conditions, she sees doctors regularly as well as a psychiatrist every few months for her mental medications.  She also has a lawyer who is attempting to get her onto disability.  Mary applied for disability on her own and was denied.  A little less than a year ago, the lawyer made his attempt and was denied and is currently trying to appeal the decision.

As for me, I'm reasonably healthy, a little overweight with slightly high blood pressure.. doc says just a lifestyle adjustment to fix that.  I work full time, 401k, full health benefits, dental, vision.  I make $15/hour which is about $30k a year.  There's about $20k saved in the 401k and only about $700 in savings.  Her and I each have about $1500 in credit card debt, each card has around 24% interest rates due to the bankruptcy leaving our credit scores around 500.   In terms of bills, per month, we pay $60 total for both cell phones together, $80 for the car insurance, $100-$200 on each credit card depending on funds, $300 for day care ( 3 days a week), $200 to pay off a shed we built in the backyard (we had a storage unit that was breaching $300/mo), $200 for a medical credit card (0 interest) we opened to pay for a medical procedure for our son -- I don't remember how much we owe on that one.  

Lately, Mary's condition leaves her either in too much pain or (rarely) too depressed to care for herself or our son during the day meaning I have to call off work.  About a year or two ago I only to call out 1 or 2 times every few months, then it was maybe once or twice a month.  The past year to now, it's at the point where I may work for a week and then have to call 3 or 4 days the next week, one time I had to call out every day for a week.  The only reason I've been able to keep my job is an Intermittent FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act) I enrolled into..  it allows me about 400ish unpaid hours over the course of the past year where I can call out of work at least an hour before my shift without consequence.  I feel my call outs have gotten so bad that I'm sure my boss is just looking for some other reason/technicality to fire me despite him being aware of my situation at home.  I just renewed the FMLA, but being its on a rolling calendar year, I only have about 40 hours worth until mid-January for them to be restored.

It doesn't really matter if I do morning or evening shifts, either way I still end up having to call out of work if Mary isn't feeling well.  Our son's daycare is helping a little... Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays, 8a-2pm gives her a small break but some days I still have to call out.  There are some daycares in the area that could do Mon-Fri but I was blown away at how expensive it is and still wouldn't cover a full work day for me.  Mary did physical therapy for a few weeks and it seemed to help, but some days she even had to stay home from it and the program had to drop her.

I love my wife so much, but things have just gotten so stressful I'm having a difficult time thinking that if I lose this job, it would impossible to find another job that would even consider accepting me due to my ""absenteeism"" .  I'm not too sure what sort of advice anyone out there has for me.  There are few programs out there that offer financial assistance, but I'm pretty sure I make too much to qualify.  I have spoken to Mary many times about this and she always says she will try to do better, but things for her seem to only get worse =(.  There isn't much help from my parents, as my dad passed about 5-6 years ago, and my stepdad passed a year or so ago.  My mom lives by herself in a trailer in what I'd call the ""country"", but she's soon going to be moving to Ohio to live with her mother who probably has less than a few year left.

&amp;#x200B;

Good god, I know some of this is partly me venting over the situation and can't believe how much I've typed.  

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - Wife, 2 y/o son, and I live with her mom, hopefully don't get canned from my job due to excessive call outs from work since my wife is too ill to care for herself or son",finance

personalfinance,Another youth confused about credit and debt.,"Trying to figure out my best way to approach my personal finances. I'm 22, working at a good part-time job making on average $1,500 a month.

 I owe $7,000 on a auto loan at 4.5%, my next debt is $6,000 on a personal loan that was for my first car... it's at 14.5% interest rate.

 I currently pay the minimum of 180 for the auto, and 130 for the personal loan. After those bills my budget is hit with $250 for car insurance, and $200 for rent. 

I'm not quite sure where the other $740 goes; upon realizing that I figured I should look for advice. My main goal is to find out the best way to pay off my debt and build up some credit hopefully. I have a decent credit score of 680.. I've been paying these for a while. I also have a credit card with a $500 limit, I've yet to activate it and unsure of the best way to use that or if it impacts my score for not using it.

Do I pay the loans off evenly or double down on one? Any tips or advice about anything financial is much appreciated..

Thank you in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Best approach to debt before buying a home? (Snowball or avalanche),"Hello! I’ve been a lurker for a while but it’s time to get my head out of the sand and get a debt plan in place!

I made quite a few bad credit decisions when I was younger that I’m still feeling the ramifications of, but things have improved quite a bit since then paid off secured loan on previous property with my ex, no store cards etc) my current situations is as follows:
- live with my husband in a mortgaged property
- mortgage will be paid off in approx 5 years, at which point we’re planning to move.
- I want to get my finances in order before this move.

I currently have 3 credit cards (£8k, £2.5k and £200 (emergency)) and 2 overdrafts (£2.5k and £400).

I can’t really decide how best to focus my approach to paying these off. Is it best to pay off the little ones first and then chip away at the larger ones, or chip away at all of them and pay any spare cash to bringing down the larger ones? 

Basically, if there are any left over when if we seek to get another mortgage in a few years, is it best to have outstanding overdrafts or credit card debt (that is being managed - no missed payments, paying over minimum payments each month)? Once an overdraft is settled, is it best to close that function altogether or to have it there and not use it? Same for credit cards - would it make sense to close the largest and smallest once paid off, and perhaps keep the £2.5k one for emergencies?

I’m fed up of being in debt and want to sort this out before we want to move / have any children. 

Thanks for reading and for providing any advice!",finance
personalfinance,Full-time Sponsored Master Student Tax Question,"Hi guys these questions may have been touched before. I'm currently doing a 2-year full-time master program with education assistance sponsorship from my employer. Fall 2018 is my first semester. Meanwhile, I'm working part-time for this employer. The sponsorship works as follows: I pay the tuition and fees out of my own pocket at the beginning of the semester. Then after the grades are released at the end of the semester, I report the grades to my employer and get reimbursement for all the money I have paid for this semester. However, the reimbursement is in the form of ""bonus"" on top of my wages and any amount above $5250 is taxed heavily like bonus. Some other information about my situation:

* Paid tuition and fee for Fall 2018 so far: $17250 ($7250 is paid by federal student loan, $10000 out of my own pocket)
* Annual income before the part-time work arrangement: $81000
* Annual income after starting working part-time: $51000
* Estimated annual income for 2018 before tax: 81000/12\*8+51000/12\*4= $71000
* Expected reimbursement as part of my wage: $17250
* State: California
* Age 25, male, single, no dependents besides myself
* Tax withhold for the reimbursement will be taken out by my employer

Being relatively new to the whole tax system, I never quite understand how the deduction works. Also, based on the timing of when my grades will be released and the time it takes for my employer to process my grade, I may get the reimbursement before or after 1/1/2019. My questions are:

1. If I get the reimbursement before 12/31/2018, should I itemize my tax deductible or use the standard deduction?
2. If I get the reimbursement after 1/1/2019, should I itemize my tax deductible or use the standard deduction?
3. Can I list the tuition and fees I paid as deduction? What type of deduction is it? Is it the ""Life time learning credit""?
4. If I list the tuition and fees as deduction, do I list the whole amount $17250 or just the part I paid out of my own pocket $10000? Does this count as part of the itemized deduction?
5. I have used the federal student loan($6250), but I have not started the repayment. Is there any student loan interest deduction that I can utilize for 2018?
6. What's tuition tax break? Do I qualify for it? What's the difference between tuition tax break and life time learning credit?

Any input will be helpful. Thank you!

personalfinance,Pay Rise Advice,"Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently employed at a software support company. I was employed under a fixed term contract for 1 year. My supervisor has already said that they will offer me a job at the end of my contract (No official offer/contract has been formed yet). He has also been asking me twice\~ a month if I am interested in continuing work there, and has told me that he really likes the work I do there. I was thinking maybe I could use the 're-employment' as an opportunity to ask for a pay rise. I don't really have a reason for the pay rise, other than that I like money.  


Some details about the situation:  
The job has a high-ish learning curve. (6 months to start to get the hang of things - general consensus of the office)  
The company is not providing funding for new employees at the moment.  
The office I am in is short staffed.

personalfinance,"22 yo with open collection from 2017 for $10k, Pay the collections or save the money instead?","I’ll try to keep this short, when I was 18 (young and dumb) I bought a new motorcycle for 10k. 5 months after having it was stolen and just for my luck I just had downgrade my insurance two months prior because it was too expensive (366 a month). I continue to pay the bike even after not having it but I had to stop because money was tight and the account ended up going to collections. The collections has only been open for 1 yr and 7 months so waiting for 7 years to fall off my report is not an option.

Since then I’ve been excellent with my finances and have managed to save 11k and plan to buy a house in the next 3 years. 

My question is should I just pay the full amount of the collection and try to pursue a pay for delete? Or instead I continue to build up my savings for the next 3 years and try to buy a house with a collection on my credit report? I know even a 1% difference in interest rate for a house can cost you thousands of dollars which scares me considering that lenders don’t like to see collections on credit reports when borrowing for a house",finance
personalfinance,"Took a loan for my first home purchase, now that I just sold, should I repay the loan?","First time posting. Thanks for the advice.  


So a few years ago, I purchased my first home in the Washington DC area. I took a loan out, about 20k, from my TSP (Federal Government equivalent to 401k) for the down payment. I just sold my place, because I'm moving away from the areas, and after everything I got about 15k back.  


Question is, in my savings now is about $25k (with the aforementioned $15k). A nice sized savings, that would cover close to 6 months of expenses, where I'm moving to is still expensive to live. Should I keep it in savings and devote any further extra savings to pay off the loan. Or, should I pay off the rest of the unpaid loan, about $18k?

&amp;#x200B;

Things to consider: 

I should be seeing some cost savings after I move. 

My car loan is paid off at the end of this month, that's about $400. 

The current loan from my tsp is for 15 years (that was the max amount of time) and it's about $120/month.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to guess, the general advice would be to keep the 25k in savings, and put as much as I can towards paying off the loan going forward.",finance

BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Connor: 02:19.68,0:02:45.10*

 **Alright so thank You Daniel and Steve for joining us. We're joined by Steve Shadders and Daniel Connolly from nChain and also the lead developers of the Satoshi’s Vision client. So Daniel and Steve do you guys just want to introduce yourselves before we kind of get started here - who are you guys and how did you get started?**

*Steve: 0,0:02:38.83,0:03:30.61* 
&gt;So I'm Steve Shadders and at nChain I am the director of solutions in engineering and specifically for Bitcoin SV I am the technical director of the project which means that I'm a bit less hands-on than Daniel but I handle a lot of the liaison with the miners - that's the conditional project.

*Daniel:*
&gt;Hi I’m Daniel I’m the lead developer for Bitcoin SV. As the team's grown that means that I do less actual coding myself but more organizing the team and organizing what we’re working on.

*Connor 03:23.07,0:04:15.98* 

**Great so we took some questions - we asked on Reddit to have people come and post their questions. We tried to take as many of those as we could and eliminate some of the duplicates, so we're gonna kind of go through each question one by one. We added some questions of our own in and we'll try and get through most of these if we can. So I think we just wanted to start out and ask, you know, Bitcoin Cash is a little bit over a year old now. Bitcoin itself is ten years old but in the past a little over a year now what has the process been like for you guys working with the multiple development teams and, you know, why is it important that the Satoshi’s vision client exists today?**

*Steve: 0:04:17.66,0:06:03.46*
&gt;I mean yes well we’ve been in touch with the developer teams for quite some time - I think a bi-weekly meeting of Bitcoin Cash developers across all implementations started around November last year. I myself joined those in January or February of this year and Daniel a few months later. So we communicate with all of those teams and I think, you know, it's not been without its challenges. It's well known that there's a lot of disagreements around it, but some what I do look forward to in the near future is a day when the consensus issues themselves are all rather settled, and if we get to that point then there's not going to be much reason for the different developer teams to disagree on stuff. They might disagree on non-consensus related stuff but that's not the end of the world because, you know, Bitcoin Unlimited is free to go and implement whatever they want in the back end of a Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin SV is free to do whatever they want in the backend, and if they interoperate on a non-consensus level great. If they don't not such a big problem there will obviously be bridges between the two, so, yeah I think going forward the complications of having so many personalities with wildly different ideas are going to get less and less. 

*Cory: 0:06:00.59,0:06:19.59*

**I guess moving forward now another question about the testnet - a lot of people on Reddit have been asking what the testing process for Bitcoin SV has been like, and if you guys plan on releasing any of those  results from the testing?**

*Daniel: 0:06:19.59,0:07:55.55*
&gt;Sure yeah so our release will be concentrated on the stability, right, with the first release of Bitcoin SV and that involved doing a large amount of additional testing particularly not so much at the unit test level but at the more system test so setting up test networks, performing tests, and making sure that the software behaved as we expected, right. Confirming the changes we made, making sure that there aren’t any other side effects. Because of, you know, it was quite a rush to release the first version so we've got our test results documented, but not in a way that we can really release them. We're thinking about doing that but we’re not there yet. 

*Steve: 0:07:50.25,0:09:50.87* 
&gt;Just to tidy that up - we've spent a lot of our time developing really robust test processes and the reporting is something that we can read on our internal systems easily, but we need to tidy that up to give it out for public release. The priority for us was making sure that the software was safe to use. We've established a test framework that involves a progression of code changes through multiple test environments - I think it's five different test environments before it gets the QA stamp of approval - and as for the question about the testnet, yeah, we've got four of them. We've got Testnet One and Testnet Two. A slightly different numbering scheme to the testnet three that everyone's probably used to – that’s just how we reference them internally. They're [1 and 2] both forks of Testnet Three. [Testnet] One we used for activation testing, so we would test things before and after activation - that one’s set to reset every couple of days. The other one [Testnet Two] was set to post activation so that we can test all of the consensus changes. The third one was a performance test network which I think most people have probably have heard us refer to before as Gigablock Testnet. I get my tongue tied every time I try to say that word so I've started calling it the Performance test network and I think we're planning on having two of those: one that we can just do our own stuff with and experiment without having to worry about external unknown factors going on and having other people joining it and doing stuff that we don't know about that affects our ability to baseline performance tests, but the other one (which I think might still be a work in progress so Daniel might be able to answer that one) is one of them where basically everyone will be able to join and they can try and mess stuff up as bad as they want.

*Daniel: 0:09:45.02,0:10:20.93* 
&gt;Yeah, so we so we recently shared the details of Testnet One and Two with the with the other BCH developer groups. The Gigablock test network we've shared up with one group so far but yeah we're building it as Steve pointed out to be publicly accessible.

*Connor: 0:10:18.88,0:10:44.00* 

**I think that was my next question I saw that you posted on Twitter about the revived Gigablock testnet initiative and so it looked like blocks bigger than 32 megabytes were being mined and propagated there, but maybe the block explorers themselves were coming down - what does that revived Gigablock test initiative look like?**

*Daniel: 0:10:41.62,0:11:58.34* 
&gt;That's what did the Gigablock test network is. So the Gigablock test network was first set up by Bitcoin Unlimited with nChain’s help and they did some great work on that, and we wanted to revive it. So we wanted to bring it back and do some large-scale testing on it. It's a flexible network - at one point we had we had eight different large nodes spread across the globe, sort of mirroring the old one. Right now we scaled back because we're not using it at the moment so they'll notice I think three. We have produced some large blocks there and it's helped us a lot in our research and into the scaling capabilities of Bitcoin SV, so it's guided the work that the team’s been doing for the last month or two on the improvements that we need for scalability.

*Steve: 0:11:56.48,0:13:34.25*
&gt;I think that's actually a good point to kind of frame where our priorities have been in kind of two separate stages. I think, as Daniel mentioned before, because of the time constraints we kept the change set for the October 15 release as minimal as possible - it was just the consensus changes. We didn't do any work on performance at all and we put all our focus and energy into establishing the QA process and making sure that that change was safe and that was a good process for us to go through. It highlighted what we were missing in our team – we got our recruiters very busy recruiting of a Test Manager and more QA people. The second stage after that is performance related work which, as Daniel mentioned, the results of our performance testing fed into what tasks we were gonna start working on for the performance related stuff. Now that work is still in progress - some of the items that we identified the code is done and that's going through the QA process but it’s not quite there yet. That's basically the two-stage process that we've been through so far. We have a roadmap that goes further into the future that outlines more stuff, but primarily it’s been QA first, performance second. The performance enhancements are close and on the horizon but some of that work should be ongoing for quite some time.

*Daniel: 0:13:37.49,0:14:35.14*
&gt;Some of the changes we need for the performance are really quite large and really get down into the base level view of the software. There's kind of two groups of them mainly. One that are internal to the software – to Bitcoin SV itself - improving the way it works inside. And then there's other ones that interface it with the outside world. One of those in particular we're working closely with another group to make a compatible change - it's not consensus changing or anything like that - but having the same interface on multiple different implementations will be very helpful right, so we're working closely with them to make improvements for scalability.

*Connor: 0:14:32.60,0:15:26.45*

**Obviously for Bitcoin SV one of the main things that you guys wanted to do that that some of the other developer groups weren't willing to do right now is to increase the maximum default block size to 128 megabytes. I kind of wanted to pick your brains a little bit about - a lot of the objection to either removing the box size entirely or increasing it on a larger scale is this idea of like the infinite block attack right and that kind of came through in a lot of the questions. What are your thoughts on the “infinite block attack” and is it is it something that that really exists, is it something that miners themselves should be more proactive on preventing, or I guess what are your thoughts on that attack that everyone says will happen if you uncap the block size?**

*Steve: 0:15:23.45,0:18:28.56* 
&gt;I'm often quoted on Twitter and Reddit - I've said before the infinite block attack is bullshit. Now, that's a statement that I suppose is easy to take out of context, but I think the 128 MB limit is something where there’s probably two schools of thought about. There are some people who think that you shouldn't increase the limit to 128 MB until the software can handle it, and there are others who think that it's fine to do it now so that the limit is increased when the software can handle it and you don’t run into the limit when this when the software improves and can handle it. Obviously we’re from the latter school of thought. As I said before we've got a bunch of performance increases, performance enhancements, in the pipeline. If we wait till May to increase the block size limit to 128 MB then those performance enhancements will go in, but we won't be able to actually demonstrate it on mainnet. As for the infinitive block attack itself, I mean there are a number of mitigations that you can put in place. I mean firstly, you know, going down to a bit of the tech detail - when you send a block message or send any peer to peer message there's a header which has the size of the message. If someone says they're sending you a 30MB message and you're receiving it and it gets to 33MB then obviously you know something's wrong so you can drop the connection. If someone sends you a message that's 129 MB and you know the block size limit is 128 you know it’s kind of pointless to download that message. So I mean these are just some of the mitigations that you can put in place. When I say the attack is bullshit, I mean I mean it is bullshit from the sense that it's really quite trivial to prevent it from happening. I think there is a bit of a school of thought in the Bitcoin world that if it's not in the software right now then it kind of doesn't exist. I disagree with that, because there are small changes that can be made to work around problems like this. One other aspect of the infinite block attack, and let’s not call it the infinite block attack, let's just call it the large block attack - it takes a lot of time to validate that we gotten around by having parallel pipelines for blocks to come in, so you've got a block that's coming in it's got a unknown stuck on it for two hours or whatever downloading and validating it. At some point another block is going to get mined b someone else and as long as those two blocks aren't stuck in a serial pipeline then you know the problem kind of goes away. 

*Cory: 0:18:26.55,0:18:48.27*

**Are there any concerns with the propagation of those larger blocks? Because there's a lot of questions around you know what the practical size of scaling right now Bitcoin SV could do and the concerns around propagating those blocks across the whole network.**

*Steve 0:18:45.84,0:21:37.73*
&gt;Yes, there have been concerns raised about it. I think what people forget is that compact blocks and xThin exist, so if a 32MB block is not send 32MB of data in most cases, almost all cases. The concern here that I think I do find legitimate is the Great Firewall of China. Very early on in Bitcoin SV we started talking with miners on the other side of the firewall and that was one of their primary concerns. We had anecdotal reports of people who were having trouble getting a stable connection any faster than 200 kilobits per second and even with compact blocks you still need to get the transactions across the firewall. So we've done a lot of research into that - we tested our own links across the firewall, rather CoinGeeks links across the firewall as they’ve given us access to some of their servers so that we can play around, and we were able to get sustained rates of 50 to 90 megabits per second which pushes that problem quite a long way down the road into the future. I don't know the maths off the top of my head, but the size of the blocks that can sustain is pretty large. So we're looking at a couple of options - it may well be the chattiness of the peer-to-peer protocol causes some of these issues with the Great Firewall, so we have someone building a bridge concept/tool where you basically just have one kind of TX vacuum on either side of the firewall that collects them all up and sends them off every one or two seconds as a single big chunk to eliminate some of that chattiness. The other is we're looking at building a multiplexer that will sit and send stuff up to the peer-to-peer network on one side and send it over splitters, to send it over multiple links, reassemble it on the other side so we can sort of transition the great Firewall without too much trouble, but I mean getting back to the core of your question - yes there is a theoretical limit to block size propagation time and that's kind of where Moore's Law comes in. Putting faster links and you kick that can further down the road and you just keep on putting in faster links. I don't think 128 main blocks are going to be an issue though with the speed of the internet that we have nowadays.

*Connor: 0:21:34.99,0:22:17.84*

**One of the other changes that you guys are introducing is increasing the max script size so I think right now it’s going from 201 to 500 [opcodes]. So I guess a few of the questions we got was I guess #1 like why not uncap it entirely - I think you guys said you ran into some concerns while testing that - and then #2 also specifically we had a question about how certain are you that there are no remaining n squared bugs or vulnerabilities left in script execution?**

*Steve: 0:22:15.50,0:25:36.79*
&gt;It's interesting the decision - we were initially planning on removing that cap altogether and the next cap that comes into play after that (next effective cap is a 10,000 byte limit on the size of the script). We took a more conservative route and decided to wind that back to 500 - it's interesting that we got some criticism for that when the primary criticism I think that was leveled against us was it’s dangerous to increase that limit to unlimited. We did that because we’re being conservative. We did some research into these log n squared bugs, sorry – attacks, that people have referred to. We identified a few of them and we had a hard think about it and thought - look if we can find this many in a short time we can fix them all (the whack-a-mole approach) but it does suggest that there may well be more unknown ones. So we thought about putting, you know, taking the whack-a-mole approach, but that doesn't really give us any certainty. We will fix all of those individually but a more global approach is to make sure that if anyone does discover one of these scripts it doesn't bring the node to a screaming halt, so the problem here is because the Bitcoin node is essentially single-threaded, if you get one of these scripts that locks up the script engine for a long time everything that's behind it in the queue has to stop and wait. So what we wanted to do, and this is something we've got an engineer actively working on right now, is once that script validation goad path is properly paralyzed (parts of it already are), then we’ll basically assign a few threads for well-known transaction templates, and a few threads for any any type of script. So if you get a few scripts that are nasty and lock up a thread for a while that's not going to stop the node from working because you've got these other kind of lanes of the highway that are exclusively reserved for well-known script templates and they'll just keep on passing through. Once you've got that in place, and I think we're in a much better position to get rid of that limit entirely because the worst that's going to happen is your non-standard script pipelines get clogged up but everything else will keep keep ticking along - there are other mitigations for this as well I mean I know you could always put a time limit on script execution if they wanted to, and that would be something that would be up to individual miners. Bitcoin SV's job I think is to provide the tools for the miners and the miners can then choose, you know, how to make use of them - if they want to set time limits on script execution then that's a choice for them.
 
*Daniel: 0:25:34.82,0:26:15.85*
&gt;Yeah, I'd like to point out that a node here, when it receives a transaction through the peer to peer network, it doesn't have to accept that transaction, you can reject it. If it looks suspicious to the node it can just say you know we're not going to deal with that, or if it takes more than five minutes to execute, or more than a minute even, it can just abort and discard that transaction, right. The only time we can’t do that is when it's in a block already, but then it could decide to reject the block as well. It's all possibilities there could be in the software.

*Steve: 0:26:13.08,0:26:20.64* 
&gt;Yeah, and if it's in a block already it means someone else was able to validate it so…

*Cory: 0,0:26:21.21,0:26:43.60* 

**There’s a lot of discussions about the re-enabled opcodes coming – OP_MUL, OP_INVERT, OP_LSHIFT, and OP_RSHIFT up invert op l shift and op r shift you maybe explain the significance of those op codes being re-enabled?**

*Steve: 0:26:42.01,0:28:17.01* 
&gt;Well I mean one of one of the most significant things is other than two, which are minor variants of DUP and MUL, they represent almost the complete set of original op codes. I think that's not necessarily a technical issue, but it's an important milestone. MUL is one that's that I've heard some interesting comments about. People ask me why are you putting OP_MUL back in if you're planning on changing them to big number operations instead of the 32-bit limit that they're currently imposed upon. The simple answer to that question is that we currently have all of the other arithmetic operations except for OP_MUL.  We’ve got add divide, subtract, modulo – it’s odd to have a script system that's got all the mathematical primitives except for multiplication. The other answer to that question is that they're useful - we've talked about a Rabin signature solution that basically replicates the function of DATASIGVERIFY. That's just one example of a use case for this - most cryptographic primitive operations require mathematical operations and bit shifts are useful for a whole ton of things. So it's really just about completing that work and completing the script engine, or rather not completing it, but putting it back the way that it was it was meant to be.

*Connor 0:28:20.42,0:29:22.62* 

**Big Num vs 32 Bit. I've seen Daniel - I think I saw you answer this on Reddit a little while ago, but the new op codes using logical shifts and Satoshi’s version use arithmetic shifts - the general question that I think a lot of people keep bringing up is, maybe in a rhetorical way but they say why not restore it back to the way Satoshi had it exactly - what are the benefits of changing it now to operate a little bit differently?**

*Daniel: 0:29:18.75,0:31:12.15*
&gt;Yeah there's two parts there - the big number one and  the L shift being a logical shift instead of arithmetic. so when we re-enabled these opcodes we've looked at them carefully and have adjusted them slightly as we did in the past with OP_SPLIT. So the new LSHIFT and RSHIFT are bitwise operators. They can be used to implement arithmetic based shifts - I think I've posted a short script that did that, but we can't do it the other way around, right. You couldn't use an arithmetic shift operator to implement a bitwise one. It's because of the ordering of the bytes in the arithmetic values, so the values that represent numbers. The little endian which means they're swapped around to what many other systems - what I've considered normal - or big-endian. And if you start shifting that properly as a number then then shifting sequence in the bytes is a bit strange, so it couldn't go the other way around - you couldn't implement bitwise shift with arithmetic, so we chose to make them bitwise operators  - that's what we proposed.

*Steve: 0:31:10.57,0:31:51.51* 
&gt;That was essentially a decision that was actually made in May, or rather a consequence of decisions that were made in May. So in May we reintroduced OP_AND, OP_OR, and OP_XOR, and that was also another decision to replace three different string operators with OP_SPLIT was also made. So that was not a decision that we've made unilaterally, it was a decision that was made collectively with all of the BCH developers - well not all of them were actually in all of the meetings, but they were all invited.
 
*Daniel: 0:31:48.24,0:32:23.13* 
&gt;Another example of that is that we originally proposed OP_2DIV and OP_2MUL was it, I think, and this is a single operator that multiplies the value by two, right, but it was pointed out that that can very easily be achieved by just doing multiply by two instead of having a separate operator for it, so we scrapped those, we took them back out, because we wanted to keep the number of operators minimum yeah.

*Steve: 0:32:17.59,0:33:47.20* 
&gt;There was an appetite around for keeping the operators minimal. I mean the decision about the idea to replace OP_SUBSTR, OP_LEFT, OP_RIGHT with OP_SPLIT operator actually came from Gavin Andresen. He made a brief appearance in the Telegram workgroups while we were working out what to do with May opcodes and obviously Gavin's word kind of carries a lot of weight and we listen to him. But because we had chosen to implement the May opcodes (the bitwise opcodes) and treat the data as big-endian data streams (well, sorry big-endian not really applicable just plain data strings) it would have been completely inconsistent to implement LSHIFT and RSHIFT as integer operators because then you would have had a set of bitwise operators that operated on two different kinds of data, which would have just been nonsensical and very difficult for anyone to work with, so yeah. I mean it's a bit like P2SH - it wasn't a part of the original Satoshi protocol that once some things are done they're done and you know if you want to want to make forward progress you've got to work within that that framework that exists.
 
*Daniel: 0:33:45.85,0:34:48.97*
&gt;When we get to the big number ones then it gets really complicated, you know, number implementations because then you can't change the behavior of the existing opcodes, and I don't mean OP_MUL, I mean the other ones that have been there for a while. You can't suddenly make them big number ones without seriously looking at what scripts there might be out there and the impact of that change on those existing scripts, right. The other the other point is  you don't know what scripts are out there because of P2SH - there could be scripts that you don't know the content of and you don't know what effect changing the behavior of these operators would mean. The big number thing is tricky, so another option might be, yeah, I don't know what the options for though it needs some serious thought.

*Steve: 0:34:43.27,0:35:24.23*
&gt;That’s something we've reached out to the other implementation teams about - actually really would like their input on the best ways to go about restoring big number operations. It has to be done extremely carefully and I don't know if we'll get there by May next year, or when, but we’re certainly willing to put a lot of resources into it and we're more than happy to work with BU or XT or whoever wants to work with us on getting that done and getting it done safely.

*Connor: 0:35:19.30,0:35:57.49* 

**Kind of along this similar vein, you know, Bitcoin Core introduced this concept of standard scripts, right - standard and non-standard scripts. I had pretty interesting conversation with Clemens Ley about use cases for “non-standard scripts” as they're called. I know at least one developer on Bitcoin ABC is very hesitant, or kind of pushed back on him about doing that and so what are your thoughts about non-standard scripts and the entirety of like an IsStandard check?**

*Steve: 0:35:58.31,0:37:35.73*
&gt;I’d actually like to repurpose the concept. I think I mentioned before multi-threaded script validation and having some dedicated well-known script templates - when you say the word well-known script template there’s already a check in Bitcoin that kind of tells you if it's well-known or not and that's IsStandard. I'm generally in favor of getting rid of the notion of standard transactions, but it's actually a decision for miners, and it's really more of a behavioral change than it is a technical change. There's a whole bunch of configuration options that miners can set that affect what they do what they consider to be standard and not standard, but the reality is not too many miners are using those configuration options. So I mean standard transactions as a concept is meaningful to an arbitrary degree I suppose, but yeah I would like to make it easier for people to get non-standard scripts into Bitcoin so that they can experiment, and from discussions of I’ve had with CoinGeek they’re quite keen on making their miners accept, you know, at least initially a wider variety of transactions eventually.
 
*Daniel: 0:37:32.85,0:38:07.95*
&gt;So I think IsStandard will remain important within the implementation itself for efficiency purposes, right - you want to streamline base use case of cash payments through them and prioritizing. That's where it will remain important but on the interfaces from the node to the rest of the network, yeah I could easily see it being removed.
 
*Cory: 0,0:38:06.24,0:38:35.46*

**Connor mentioned that there's some people that disagree with Bitcoin SV and what they're doing - a lot of questions around, you know, why November? Why implement these changes in November - they think that maybe the six-month delay might not cause a split. Well, first off what do you think about the ideas of a potential split and I guess what is the urgency for November?*

*Steve: 0:38:33.30,0:40:42.42*
&gt;Well in November there's going to be a divergence of consensus rules regardless of whether we implement these new op codes or not. Bitcoin ABC released their spec for the November Hard fork change I think on August 16th or 17th something like that and their client as well and it included CTOR and it included DSV. Now for the miners that commissioned the SV project, CTOR and DSV are controversial changes and once they're in they're in. They can't be reversed - I mean CTOR maybe you could reverse it at a later date, but DSV once someone's put a P2SH transaction into the project or even a non P2SH transaction in the blockchain using that opcode it's irreversible. So it's interesting that some people refer to the Bitcoin SV project as causing a split - we're not proposing to do anything that anyone disagrees with - there might be some contention about changing the opcode limit but what we're doing, I mean Bitcoin ABC already published their spec for May and it is our spec for the new opcodes, so in terms of urgency - should we wait? Well the fact is that we can't - come November you know it's bit like Segwit - once Segwit was in, yes you arguably could get it out by spending everyone's anyone can spend transactions but in reality it's never going to be that easy and it's going to cause a lot of economic disruption, so yeah that's it. We're putting out changes in because it's not gonna make a difference either way in terms of whether there's going to be a divergence of consensus rules - there's going to be a divergence whether whatever our changes are. Our changes are not controversial at all.

*Daniel: 0:40:39.79,0:41:03.08* 
&gt;If we didn't include these changes in the November upgrade we'd be pushing ahead with a no-change, right, but the November upgrade is there so we should use it while we can. Adding these non-controversial changes to it.

*Connor: 0:41:01.55,0:41:35.61*

**Can you talk about DATASIGVERIFY? What are your concerns with it? The general concept that's been kind of floated around because of Ryan Charles is the idea that it's a subsidy, right - that it takes a whole megabyte and kind of crunches that down and the computation time stays the same but maybe the cost is lesser - do you kind of share his view on that or what are your concerns with it?**

*Daniel: 0:41:34.01,0:43:38.41* 
&gt;Can I say one or two things about this – there’s different ways to look at that, right. I'm an engineer - my specialization is software, so the economics of it I hear different opinions. I trust some more than others but I am NOT an economist. I kind of agree with the ones with my limited expertise on that it's a subsidy it looks very much like it to me, but yeah that's not my area. What I can talk about is the software - so adding DSV adds really quite a lot of complexity to the code right, and it's a big change to add that. And what are we going to do - every time someone comes up with an idea we’re going to add a new opcode? How many opcodes are we going to add? I saw reports that Jihan was talking about hundreds of opcodes or something like that and it's like how big is this client going to become - how big is this node - is it going to have to handle every kind of weird opcode that that's out there? The software is just going to get unmanageable and DSV - that was my main consideration at the beginning was the, you know, if you can implement it in script you should do it, because that way it keeps the node software simple, it keeps it stable, and you know it's easier to test that it works properly and correctly. It's almost like adding (?) code from a microprocessor you know why would you do that if you can if you can implement it already in the script that is there.
 
*Steve: 0:43:36.16,0:46:09.71*
&gt;It’s actually an interesting inconsistency because when we were talking about adding the opcodes in May, the philosophy that seemed to drive the decisions that we were able to form a consensus around was to simplify and keep the opcodes as minimal as possible (ie where you could replicate a function by using a couple of primitive opcodes in combination, that was preferable to adding a new opcode that replaced) OP_SUBSTR is an interesting example - it's a combination of SPLIT, and SWAP and DROP opcodes to achieve it. So at really primitive script level we've got this philosophy of let's keep it minimal and at this sort of (?) philosophy it’s all let's just add a new opcode for every primitive function and Daniel's right - it's a question of opening the floodgates. Where does it end? If we're just going to go down this road, it almost opens up the argument why have a scripting language at all? Why not just add a hard code all of these functions in one at a time? You know, pay to public key hash is a well-known construct (?) and not bother executing a script at all but once we've done that we take away with all of the flexibility for people to innovate, so it's a philosophical difference, I think, but I think it's one where the position of keeping it simple does make sense. All of the primitives are there to do what people need to do. The things that people don't feel like they can't do are because of the limits that exist. If we had no opcode limit at all, if you could make a gigabyte transaction so a gigabyte script, then you can do any kind of crypto that you wanted even with 32-bit integer operations, Once you get rid of the 32-bit limit of course, a lot of those a lot of those scripts come up a lot smaller, so a Rabin signature script shrinks from 100MB to a couple hundred bytes.
 
*Daniel: 0:46:06.77,0:47:36.65*
&gt;I lost a good six months of my life diving into script, right. Once you start getting into the language and what it can do, it is really pretty impressive how much you can achieve within script. Bitcoin was designed, was released originally, with script. I mean it didn't have to be – it could just be instead of having a transaction with script you could have accounts and you could say trust, you know, so many BTC from this public key to this one - but that's not the way it was done. It was done using script, and script provides so many capabilities if you start exploring it properly. If you start really digging into what it can do, yeah, it's really amazing what you can do with script. I'm really looking forward to seeing some some very interesting applications from that. I mean it was Awemany his zero-conf script was really interesting, right. I mean it relies on DSV which is a problem (and some other things that I don't like about it), but him diving in and using script to solve this problem was really cool, it was really good to see that.

*Steve: 0:47:32.78,0:48:16.44*
&gt;I asked a question to a couple of people in our research team that have been working on the Rabin signature stuff this morning actually and I wasn't sure where they are up to with this, but they're actually working on a proof of concept (which I believe is pretty close to done) which is a Rabin signature script - it will use smaller signatures so that it can fit within the current limits, but it will be, you know, effectively the same algorithm (as DSV) so I can't give you an exact date on when that will happen, but it looks like we'll have a Rabin signature in the blockchain soon (a mini-Rabin signature).

**Based on your responses I think I kinda already know the answer to this question, but there's a lot of questions about ending experimentation on Bitcoin. I was gonna kind of turn that into – with the plan that Bitcoin SV is on do you guys see like a potential one final release, you know that there's gonna be no new opcodes ever released (like maybe five years down the road we just solidify the base protocol and move forward with that) or are you guys more on the idea of being open-ended with appropriate testing that we can introduce new opcodes under appropriate testing.**
 
*Steve: 0:48:55.80,0:49:47.43*
&gt;I think you've got a factor in what I said before about the philosophical differences. I think new functionality can be introduced just fine. Having said that - yes there is a place for new opcodes but it's probably a limited place and in my opinion the cryptographic primitive functions for example CHECKSIG uses ECDSA with a specific elliptic curve, hash 256 uses SHA256 - at some point in the future those are going to no longer be as secure as we would like them to be and we'll replace them with different hash functions, verification functions, at some point, but I think that's a long way down the track.

*Daniel: 0:49:42.47,0:50:30.3*
&gt;I'd like to see more data too. I'd like to see evidence that these things are needed, and the way I could imagine that happening is that, you know, that with the full scripting language some solution is implemented and we discover that this is really useful, and over a period of, like, you know measured in years not days, we find a lot of transactions are using this feature, then maybe, you know, maybe we should look at introducing an opcode to optimize it, but optimizing before we even know if it's going to be useful, yeah, that's the wrong approach. 

*Steve: 0:50:28.19,0:51:45.29* 
&gt;I think that optimization is actually going to become an economic decision for the miners. From the miner’s point of view is if it'll make more sense for them to be able to optimize a particular process - does it reduce costs for them such that they can offer a better service to everyone else? Yeah, so ultimately these decisions are going to be miner’s main decisions, not developer decisions. Developers of course can offer their input - I wouldn't expect every miner to be an expert on script, but as we're already seeing miners are actually starting to employ their own developers. I’m not just talking about us - there are other miners in China that I know have got some really bright people on their staff that question and challenge all of the changes - study them and produce their own reports. We've been lucky with actually being able to talk to some of those people and have some really fascinating technical discussions with them.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Keep Auto Loan or Use 0% BT Offer with No Transfer Fee?,"Moving $9k loan at 6% interest rate to a 0% credit card balance transfer offer. Pros and cons? Here is some info:

&amp;#x200B;

Navyfed has issued me a generous credit line with a 0% BT offer with NO transfer fee. If i utilize the BT offer I will use up a little less than half the available credit line on the card.

I currently have no balances on my other credit cards (pay statements in full every month) and this will be the only balance I carry. It wouldn't be more than 30% of my available credit.

The amount I would have to pay every month to the credit card in order to pay it off before I'm charged interest within those 12 months,  I could pay the same amount to the auto loan and and be done in the same general time frame. 12 (cc) vs 14 months (auto loan). I would be paying interest on the auto loan. I hate paying interest, especially at 6%,

Assuming making the payments on time is not an issue, what are the pros and cons of utilizing the BT offer vs simply keeping the loan? Is having the revolving loan more favorable on my credit report than an unsecured cc debt? 

I also am aware that anything could happen in life and while I'm financially stable and fairly certain making the payments won't be an issue, is this just a case of me being enticed by that 0% incentive?

2) My only student debt is roughly $55k (including accrued interest) in living expenses for my 3 years of law school. I have worked roughly 20 hours a week throughout law school to minimize how much debt I would accrue.

3) My post-graduate job is in another city and we plan to move in July.

4) He has no debt and about $50k available as a down payment.

5) We both have good credit scores (750+).

How do mortgage lenders handle the fact that I have student loan debt, but am moving for a job that I will start immediately after taking the bar exam? I can't be the first person in this situation. Will my student loan debt hurt our interest rate? Could he potentially qualify for a better loan if he applies before we get married? Will I be considered a dependent once we get married? If we can get a better loan by doing this sooner, we don't mind getting a house earlier than we need it.

It’s a long stupid story(just to preface; I KNOW IM STUPID) but here it goes. I totaled my amazing 2010 Mazda CX-7 back in February with TWO payments left. I needed a car and only had 2 weeks with a car rental and working 50 hour weeks to find one. I follow this sub heavily and walked in knowing what i wanted; a Toyota rav-4. I had been pre-approved for $10,000 with a decent interest rate. I’m a 26 yr female who grew up in a family of mechanics(i know more than an average girl) so i walk in determined not to get swindled this time around(got suckered into a 17.8% interest rate on my Mazda when i bought it in 2014). I took my closest friend/coworker as well for support. I get to the dealership and they sold the rav 4 i had seen online and called about so the salesman shows me some others. I wasn’t really impressed and my friend mentions i know how to drive stick. Well wouldn’t you know it they got the cutest 2012 Mini Cooper Countryman S there just that day, and of course why wouldn’t i just test drive it real quick? I test drive it and this salesman can tell I’m really enjoying it and tries really hard to sell me the car that’s out of my price range. I say no and come back the next day after picking a little Nissan. When i get there they tell me they got me a ‘really’ good deal with the bank(i said no to both offers they gave me the night before). My payment was only now $40/mo more than the other car so i call my mom for advice and she tells me to get the car i WANT and she will help me. Okay fine, I’m sold. Its fast, fun, cute...
Then fast forward to a warm October day where i go to leave for lunch from work and my car is VERY fucked up. I press in the clutch, it doesn’t feel right, i start it and it sounds awful, i try to back out and it chugs and stalls out. This clutch never felt bad, car never acted weird mechanically(my screen went out for a week in the heat of summer and then randomly came back to life like nothing happened). I had it towed to a friend of a friend, he couldn’t figure it out so i had it towed to the mini dealer. They came back with over $5,000 worth of repairs which honestly was a huge shock. I owe around $12,000. I don’t see any option other than surrendering. I saw it’ll be on my credit for 7 years and that they’ll take it to collections but when I called my bank today the lady i spoke with in the nicest tone said ‘you’ll sign a paper and then we will sue and garnish your wages for it’. I’m so strapped for money at this point, i REALLY can’t afford a garnishment. 
The best part about all of this is I’ve made the next step in my life by enrolling in a medical billing and coding program and start tomorrow with no car. I come from a really poor family and trying my hardest to make at least a living wage so i can pay off debt and build my own family. 
What steps should i be taking to get to where i want and need to be?

After the interest of it all, it is basically us paying $20 to the principal. The loan itself won’t go away until it’s paid off or until she dies, whichever comes first from it looks like...

Mom and I are in a 30:70 agreement that I pay in contribution on top of my own 30K student loans that are also under income repayment (but are arranged to be “forgiven” after 120 months of repayment?).

btc,Thought Experiment on the Necessity of a Hash War,"Imagine it is the year 2045.

&amp;#x200B;

A half dozen miners control over 50% of bitcoin. But there are well over a hundred other pools and miners that make up 99% of bitcoin hash.

&amp;#x200B;

Total hashing power is over a 100 Trillion (with a 'T') times more powerful than the entire network in the year 2018.

It would take well over a few Trillion dollars of investment to bring online the combined hash of 51% of the network.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question:**

How would an evil actor subvert this network?

&amp;#x200B;

**Answer:**

Threaten violence or subvert the owners of just a couple of domain names and tell them ""Support the fork to FedCoinAlgorithm or else your family dies"".

And just tell the world ""the 51% of hashing power is attacking the network because the FedCoinAlgorithm **was on the roadmap for 6 months and it will help parallel validation""**

&amp;#x200B;

Mission accomplished, they were able to fork the protocol with an upgrade to FedCoinAlgorithm or HastyNotNeededFeature to unbalance the economic incentives.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of spending a few 100 billion or a trillion dollars....they just needed a well orchestrated campaign to threaten a couple of people to support their efforts to ""scale bitcoin with FedCoinAlgorithm and HastyNotNeededFeature"".

&amp;#x200B;

**My thoughts:**

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin needs no leaders. **My personal opinion is that Roger is testing us to see if we will fall in line like a bunch of sheep to him.** Or whether hashrate will come out to defend the original design of bitcoin (or whether everyone will bend over to some dev group who wants to bend BCH out of shape into CtorCoin).

Bitcoin can only succeed if it sacrifices the ""leaders"" at the altar of hash.

My wife and I are selling a property we own outright. We’ve owned the property for ~1.5 years. The property is vacant land and has not ever been our primary residence. The property is located in a different state than the one we currently reside in.

Here are the questions:

1.	Will we be paying capital gains tax, or simply federal tax calculated from our combined income tax bracket?
2.	Will we have to pay state income tax for the state the property is being sold in, or just for the state that we reside in?
3.	Any ideas on municipal/local income tax liability if the property is being sold in a location that has that (but not where we claim residence)?
4.	Will we have to pay state sales tax in both states, or just the state that we’re selling the property in?

I realize I’ve left the details somewhat vague (intentional). If more information is needed, please let me know. 

Also, we (buyer and seller) didn’t use a realtor for this transaction. We had our lawyers handle everything for us. That’s why I’m somewhat hazy on the possible tax liability we may be responsible for. 

Ultimately, I plan on scheduling an appointment with our local accountant to handle the tax payments for us. I was just hoping someone might be able to give me a heads up regarding our potential tax liability ahead of time.

69k salaried income for one person.
20-40k expected profit from others personal business (sole proprietorship)
30k in a savings account for emergency fund and future house down payment. 
20k in business savings account for business emergency and future business expenses 
18k student loan at 6.2% interest

We've been living off the salaried income for almost a year now as the business has started to take off and wanting to save as much as possible. We haven't yet taken a paycheck from the business but plan to do so for this upcoming year. 
 
Our current plan is to pay off the student loans first, and then start house hunting while saving up additional for a house payment. We're thinking of looking in the 400k+ range for a house whenever we do so. I like this plan, and we've used the debt snowball to pay off 7 other debts, but now that we're down to the last one, its looking huge and intimidating. It's a big principle and a big interest rate too. It makes us sick thinking about it. 

We're wondering if this plan is fine or if we should start looking for a house now and pay off the debt after. We'd like to keep a 15k emergency fund at all times for personal and business. 

Greatly appreciate any input or even simple encouragement at this time. Thanks all!",finance

personalfinance,Cashing out 457 Deferred Compensation Plan and Cash Match 401 (a) Plan?,"Hi all,

I recently left my job with the state government of Virginia. And as a result, I can access my contributions to the Virginia 457 Deferred Compensation Plan and the Virginia Cash Match 401 (a) Plan,

Out of curiosity, does it make sense to cash out these out?

The 457 Deferred Comp Plan Plan
Balance $5,284.37
Current Rate of Return -1.4%

Virginia Cash Match Plan
Balance $2,904.22
Current Rate of Return -2.0%

I can either role over this money into a Roth or cash out and use on student loans -- the student loans are hovering at about 5.7% interest with a total of 14k.

One thing I found on the state's retirement website:
""You may request a payment of your 457 plan funds and any cash match funds by electing a lump sum, a periodic payment or a combination of these distribution methods. Funds paid directly to you are subject to federal and state income taxes. Cash match funds also may be subject to a 10 percent federal tax penalty if you withdraw them before age 59½. Payments from the 457 Plan are not subject to this tax penalty.""",finance

personalfinance,"I have never paid a student loan payment, it's always been deferred or put into forbearance. Can anyone help me figure this out?","I currently have 2 Direct Sub Consolidation Loans, both at a fixed 5% rate. These loans are through Fed Loan Servicing.

I am unsure as to where it gets those payment amounts from, I previously qualified for an IBR plan years ago, but ended up putting it into deferment. I do see it asks me to re-certify. Are those payment amounts still based on the IBR or are those what I can expect to pay when I come out of deferment?

&amp;#x200B;

I believe my loans come out of deferment in March. I'm terrible at math - what would I need to pay per month until then to at least keep the interest from accruing? Is it just 5% of the principal each month? Any help would be great appreciated!

I currently make \~48k a year, with total bills in the ballpark of 2k a month, leaving about 900/950 a month extra. Should I put be putting down 25% of what is left over towards these loans?

**Edit:** Thanks to the AutoMod, I just found the [StudentLoans.gov](https://StudentLoans.gov) estimator. I have these options - which do you think is best? Could I pay a little extra each month to help cut down on the interest accrued? Should I even bother?

stocks,This Point in History,"Hello everyone. The mods and I have recently been discussing and going over a few ideas to increase discussion and make our subreddit a little more interesting. Some of you may have seen our recent additions to discussion threads and their topics. Something else we are now adding to our subreddit are occasional posts regarding historic or interesting events involving the stock market, investing, or the economy. I won’t be doing these super often, mostly due to time constraints and because of the limitations of finding events that we feel are noteworthy enough. I also had a little bit of trouble coming up with a good name for these posts. For now, I’ll be calling them “This Point in History” but if anyone has a better or catchier name, I’m all ears. I would also like to give a moment to give credit to the handful of history websites out there that helped with finding these topics.

The goal of these posts is to generate some discussion and educate readers about events that we feel were important and historic in nature. My idea is to present a topic/event, provide a brief description of it, and then turn the discussion to you guys. If anyone has any ideas or thoughts for upcoming events they would like to be discussed, again feel free to comment or message me as I’m all ears. So, without further ado, let’s go back to early November in the year 1907.

The US was a few weeks into an event which would later be called “The Great Panic 1907” in which investor confidence sank deeply in the US banking system, economy, and stock market. The average American was skeptical on all fronts and a huge sense of distrust developed in these industries, the government, and amongst major businesses. Various stretches of “bank runs” occurred where people ran to withdraw their money from their local banks in fear of losing it or seeing its value further plummet. Americans called for stricter and tighter regulations on these banks and companies as stock manipulations schemes appeared more frequent than many initially thought. The New York Stock Exchange had fallen over 50% from its all-time highs in 1906. The third largest trust in the US, The Knickerbocker Trust, would fall by late October. Most of this stuff occurred in early fall but by early November things were looking particularly dire for the US.

Seventy old banker John Pierpont Morgan (better known today as JP Morgan and for his company) stepped up to the plate to restore consumer confidence in early November 1907 by issuing money and cutting deals, both things aiding in the liquidity crisis that struck the US. Morgan was joined by other groups and wealthy individuals such John D. Rockefeller to find a way out of this crisis. If not for people like Morgan, Rockefeller, and others then things could have potentially turned much worse. To help prevent such future events, the Federal Reserve would be established only a few years later in 1913 and regulations were somewhat tighter than what they were less than a decade ago.

Just over a hundred years later the world would face the Great Financial Crisis and while it appeared that we had learned from some of our mistakes of 1907, it was evident the system we had in place was far from perfect. Weak banking regulations are probably one of the first things that come to mind when comparing both events. While not quite the same, both events were fixed in part with the help of bailouts. Is the US in better shape today to prevent another event like 2008 or 1907 or is history doomed to repeat itself under a slightly different manner? What ways or actions can we take to prevent events like these occurring?",finance

personalfinance,"Considering a DMP or Chapter 7, need advice on which I should choose?","I have gotten to the point that I can no longer pay off my monthly bills. My net income after taxes and insurance is $3000/month.

I owe approximately $3500 on my car loan still, which is costing me $300/month. The car is only worth around $6000 so selling it won't really give me much breathing room and a car is necessary for my job. I also spend around $250/month on insurance and gas. I've slashed my monthly grocery bills to around $80/month. I have a minimal cell phone plan at $25/month. Rent is $850/month and that's about as cheap as you will find in my area ($1700/month split between me and one other person). Student loan debt is $300/month ($24,000 total). I also have racked up around $5000 in medical expenses this year which is on a payment plan for about $200/month. I also have 1 retail jeweler card I used to buy an engagement ring a couple of years ago that I still owe $7000 on and 5 credit cards which I maxed (I'm not generally irresponsible with my credit, but I also had healthcare and rent costs that I couldn't pay in the past that I had to use credit for) and I currently owe around $19000 (which comes out to about $26000 total). This means I'm paying a minimum of around $1000/month which will take my lifetime to pay back considering the crippling interest rates (~25%).

Is it even worth trying to make a DMP with a financial advisor or should I try for chapter 7?

personalfinance,Should I balance transfer between CC's?,"Hey guys!

So admittedly I am fiscally irresponsible, but I want to try to change that. I have created a budget for myself and am sticking to it for the most part. I have a question regarding credit cards though. I currently have the Discover card, which has a 27.99% interest rate (!!) and I have racked up nearly 4k in debt on it since 2012. I just opened a Costco Citi card, which has a much lower rate of 17%. I purchased a laptop for 600 on that card because of the deal Costco offers, plus another 100 for other items and have a spending limit of about 5500. Should I transfer the balance of the other card to this new card and close it? There's a 3% fee to transfer according to the paperwork. This will leave me with not much spending ability with the new card, although maybe that's a good thing. Let me know if you would need more info to help with this decision, I just don't even know where to begin. Thanks!!",finance

That being said, we had no intention of taking a loan and paying cash but due to us aggressively paying down my student loan debt, we are only sitting on $2.5k or so.  Thus, we are going to take out a loan to buy a new (to us) vehicle and just paying it off in a few months.  I have seen the longer term loans have lower interest rates.  Would it be stupid to take out the longest term possible to get the lowest rate to minimize what we pay in interest? In my mind, as long as there is no early payoff penalty, having the lowest interest possible makes sense in my mind.  What are your thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

What we are looking at:

&amp;#x200B;

\-2015 Ford Escape

\-41k miles

\-only 1 previous owner

\-brand new brakes, rotors, and tires

\-$14,500 sticker price

\-$2,500 or $3,00 down payment

personalfinance,Question on TSP/FERS and leaving federal employment,"Hello, I'm 23 and leaving my federal job after 1 year 3 months and am wondering what to do about my TSP contributions if don't plan on ever returning to government service. Currently I have about 6k in an L fund, should I just leave it in there until I eventually retire or should I pull it out and add it to my Vanguard Roth IRA which also has about 6k in it currently? I know the fees are lower on the TSP, but I'm wondering if its worth it to withdraw or rollover so my Roth value will be greater and make it easier to manage.

personalfinance,buying used vs new car dilemma,"So I'm trying to buy a used car for 14k (3k down and 36 months finance) but my parents are pushing me to buy a new car. They want to lend me 18k no interest if I buy a new car for around 21k where I would only have to use my down payment of 3k to buy the car out right. Their argument is that I won't have to worry about the car braking down etc. and I won't have to pay interest to the bank. Would it be wiser to buy a brand new one or an older one?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I was looking at a 2017 Corolla with 27,000 miles for $14k. Vs. a  brand new 2019 Camry for $21k and my interest rate would be around 6%. I make about 65k/year before tax",finance

personalfinance,"Signing for HELOC today, is 7.4% too high?","I have been qualified for a 50k line of credit in a HELOC.

&amp;#x200B;

My initial APR is 4.99% for 1 year, afterwards (with discounts like auto payments) it will be 7.45% (was 7.8%). I can also renegotiate interest rates after the 1 year mark as well. The maximum is 24% (which actually scares me).

&amp;#x200B;

Is this too high by a large margin or is it slightly higher? I have close friends whom are financially successful saying I should not accept a point over prime (guessing they mean 1% over prime).

&amp;#x200B;

If I don't plan on having this loan or payments for any longer than 4-5 years is this bad or should I look elsewhere?

&amp;#x200B;

edit: I've decided to sign it. It's not the best rate, but between not having to pay for anything up front and not needing to use that much I don't think it's that terrible. If I had plans to borrow most of it I'd probably do more shopping but this is more or less just me wanting something available if I need it minus a few projects.

personalfinance,I would strongly recommend the military for re-setting your life financially and professionally.,"Basically what the title says.

Once upon a time, I had a BA in a social science field that was getting me nothing but low-paid jobs, and I would have needed to go to grad school to ever have a real chance of landing a salaried position. I paid my own way through college and was not willing to take on additional debt for a graduate degree in an already very competitive (and low-paying) field. I wanted to go in a different direction.

I had worked part-time at a law firm during college, and I decided working in a support position (i.e. paralegal/legal assistant) was something I was very interested in. I applied for positions at every law firm in my general area and received nothing but rejection and one invitation to intern for free. No thanks, I had bills to pay.

The military had always been something I'd considered and I did a lot of research on the different branches and what they offered. Turns out the Army offers an enlisted position that was exactly what I was looking for--Paralegal Specialist, and since I had a degree I would enter the military as an E-4. The Army also guarantees that the specific job you select is written into your contract.

It's now a little over four years since I raised my right hand-- I now work for the Department of Justice. My military service counts towards my federal retirement and also put me in a higher leave bracket. The high-ranking connections I made in the Army JAG Corps combined with the job experience I received are what landed me this position. I have thousands of dollars in the bank that I saved because I didn't need to pay for housing, food, or health insurance while I served. I'll be able to use a VA-backed loan to buy a house when I choose to, and if I want to go back to school I can do so for free using the GI Bill.

I write all this because I read this sub regularly and there are so many posts by people who don't make a living wage, or majored in something unmarketable (like me) and don't know what the next step should be, or who have student loan debt, or are just kind of lost in life. And I think military service could benefit a lot of those people.

Of course this comes with a large caveat: the military comes with risks. You could deploy, you could be in combat, you could die, you could be involved in a freak training accident, etc. You could also get stuck in a terrible unit with toxic leadership. It's all luck of the draw really. I was incredibly fortunate in having a positive experience but I know many aren't so fortunate. It's the ultimate 'your experience may vary' scenario.

But at least for me it was a great way to kickstart my career in the direction I wanted to go and set myself up financially. I just wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone who may be considering the service.

personalfinance,Looking for advice in reducing interest rate(s),"Background:

I decided i wanted to seperate with +10,000 so that i have a reasonable savings.

since i pay 326$ a month, after 32 months, that brings my total down to **$6133** left on my loan.

I already have a savings of 5k.

What im debating, is if i should pay off that remaning 6133$ once i seperate, contribue more to my monthly payment to get it paid off **Before** i seperate, that way i have equity in my car (estimate payment: **326+192=518**. **518x32**= **16576**.) **Car is paid off.**

Should i just simply keep saving my money and pay it off for the entire loan period. I wouldn't save much on interest, being that my rate is so low.

personalfinance,Using federal loan forgiveness to help pay for a PhD,"Sorry if there's a better subreddit for this question, feel free to redirect me and I'll move this question there.

My girlfriend is in the first semester of a PhD program in Clinical Psychology at a smaller private school in Oregon. It's anticipated to be a 5 year program plus 1-2 years of internships and post-docs after defending her dissertation. Tuition is roughly $35k/year, and while her parents agreed to pay the first semester's tuition themselves, the remainder of the program plus living expenses will be paid for through student loans. There is no stipend and only minimal opportunities for scholarships and teaching/research assistantships, which she's taking advantage of and cover only around $5-6k/year. The best estimates we've seen point to somewhere in the neighborhood of ~$180k worth of loans to pay for tuition and living expenses for the duration of the program. 

The good news is that she wants to work in academia after graduating, which would allow her (in theory) to take advantage of the federal loan forgiveness program. Once she's worked for any university - public or private - for 10 years, the remainder of her loan will be forgiven, provided she makes the minimum monthly payments until that point. It's a little hard to estimate what will happen after she graduates, but if she gets a starting salary of $40k/yr (which is just an estimate) after graduating, that should translate to a monthly minimum payment of roughly $300/month. It looks like most research and assistant professorships start at something like $60k, with tenure-track positions reaching the low six figures.

I know that the actual number of people who have received federal loan forgiveness as of today is tiny, but I've also heard that people only started becoming eligible for loan forgiveness in the past several years and that many of the denied applications were due to the applicant not really understanding the forgiveness requirements/process. There's also a non-zero chance that loan forgiveness will be drastically cut or completely removed by the current administration, and that the specifics of the law could change multiple times between now and roughly 15 years from now when she's eligible.

Given all this, I'm curious if there are other people in a similar position who could share what their plan is. The silver lining is that I'm lucky to work in a pretty high paying industry and make around 100k/year at 24, so if we were to get married and combine our finances in a few years, her loans would certainly be a huge part of planning for the future but shouldn't be insurmountable, especially if she only needs to make minimum payments ranging from $300/mo in the first year to an estimated $1200/month in the 10th year. Ultimately, both academia or private practice (which is another option) should pay well enough over the course of her career to make this degree worth it in the long run, but I'm trying to figure out how to make this work in the next 10-20 years. It feels like this is such a complex topic so I'd really appreciate any help or insight from people in a similar situation. Thanks!",finance

gaming,GameStop’s customer service is awful and I am trapped in an infinite cycle,"To preface this I have been shopping at GameStop for well over a decade and have always been a member of their reward program’s top tier, what ever it was at the time. I still am a member of the Elite rewards tier. For reference I bought the Xbox One X on August 28th and this is STILL on going. Also sorry if formatting is bad I’m on mobile.

So here is where it all began, I went into GameStop to purchase an Xbox One X. I purchased it, but decided to get a refund as I had not opened the package yet. The troubles first begin when the employee informs me they have no Xbox One Xs so she will have to order one for me online. Ok fine by me. She asks if the email for my account is correct I ask if I can change she says yes and I gave her the new email. Turns out she just put the order under the email not my account so I did not even get any points and making it even more inconvenient for me to find the order and return it. 

The order arrives after about 2-3 days which was pretty fast considering I did not get express shipping, and I was happy. I had already decided to return it at this point so I did not open the package and when I got around to it I went into GameStop and asked for a refund the man tells me yeah we can do that, I left the shipping note in the car so I went to grab after him saying he needed it. I come back and he goes oh I can’t give you a refund and so I asked what I could do and he kinda shrugged and I asked if I need to talk to support online and he told me yeah, not very helpful, but fine I’ll do that, it can’t be that bad right? Wrong.

After multiple failed attempts to call GameStop but not having enough time due to their wait time being over an hour! I decided I should email them. I email them my order details asking for a refund. After 5 days still no response and no luck calling either. Finally after 8 days I get an email simply asking for my billing phone number. I responded with the phone number, which was already included when I first reached out to them, then they contact me back (all of this is in very broken English so I have trouble understanding) telling me I’m set to get a refund now if I could send back the Xbox they will get it sorted out. Finally! 

I ask what I should use to ship it back because no shipping label was included. They respond with an order number from UPS, great but what about a shipping label? The GameStop member responds saying I do not need one. I asked where I was supposed to ship the box to then. They reply saying that I have to use the order number. I ask if the label included when it arrived doubled as a return label, nope I have to use the order number. I eventually asked if that was even possible and UPS said they needed a shipping label. I email back saying I just went to UPS and I need a shipping label, can you guess what the response was? Use the order number.

I get really fed up and decide to ignore the emails and to call and just sit it out even if that means waiting hours. I get a hold of someone in about 15 minutes, but it was hard to understand the person as they had an Indian accent and again spoke broken English. I explained the problem to the man and he told me that they always send out shipping labels and the person emailing me was doing it wrong. He was helpful and processed a shipping label and I finally took it and shipped it glad to get this over with after about two to three weeks of working on this. Now to just wait for a refund. 

I never ended up getting one so after about a week or two I call back asking what was up. The lady on the phone again barely spoke English with a heavy accent and said that she was going to process a refund and after about 45 minutes on the phone she finally processes one and tells me to wait 2-5 business days for a refund, no refund number, no email confirmation, nothing she just tells me to wait and the money will be refunded. So I wait.

I call again this week after nothing happened and what do you know the refund was processed wrong AGAIN! The man of course barely speaks English and tells me that the refund was never processed, he tells me he resubmitted the refund request and will email me as well as call me the next day, today, which he does and asks if I want the money on a gift card or on a corporate check that will take 25 business days to arrive I ask if I can call back and decide later, he says that will be fine and I thank him. I call back asking if there is any way it can be expedited after two months of dealing with this and a different person now says that I will get a refund tomorrow, magically I guess? I do not think I will receive my money back tomorrow and will probably have to call back again. I’m not even sure if I’ll ever get it back. $500 down the drain, they still have the Xbox as well and have confirmed they received it.

I will never be ordering online from GameStop again and this has been a major turn off for me from the company as a whole.

I will edit tomorrow to see if this gets resolved.",technology

personalfinance,Should I sell home? or not?,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

This might be too long to read for many of you, but I still decided to write this here since there might be many who have insights into personal finance, who can help me with making a big decision to sell my home or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I am moving to another country in different parts of the world, and will not be planning to return back to the US at least a few months, and even years depending on how things go. The thing is, I own a condo in Seattle, and I am unsure if I should sell my condo before going back or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Financially speaking, if I sell my condo, it will net me around $200k\~$225k after paying off mortgage + fees + taxes. With stocks, bonds, and ETFs investments, I can make **+$10k\~12k/year** from the $200k\~$225k net profit, **if I sell home**.

&amp;#x200B;

If I do not sell my condo, I will have to pay HOAs (-$5k/year), property tax (-4k/year), which sums around to -$9k/year for a home that I won't be staying in. I will also need to pay for the mortgage, for the loan amount of -$320k with 4.25% interest rate, which translates to -13k/year interest payments. With tax deductions, I might be able to get 15% of interest payments (+2k) back.. considering my sole income will be from my investments under 15% tax bracket/year. In the end, I will lose around **-$20k/year** from these costs **if I keep home**. I am not including much of principal payments, as I see it as buying the home asset. Also, due to a very low rental cap from HOA, renting out my unit is not much of an option, so I am putting that aside...

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the **net difference** between selling/keeping is around **+30k/year** and **+$200k in cash** financially. It obviously seems to be a good choice to sell the condo based on the above numbers. However, I wanted to understand if my assumptions are correct.

1. Real estate market is cooling off. I can often see that there are more listings showing up in my area, and prices are going down. It used to be sellers' market at least until early 2017, but I can feel that we are entering the healthy market. With rising interest rates, and ballooned home prices, I don't expect my home price to go up significantly in next year or years after that, and I won't be losing much of potential gains if even if sell it soon.
2. Because of reason #1 above, I am afraid that home prices will fall somewhat and I will be losing a lot of opportunity cost just by keeping the home.
3. A lot of, I mean a lot of, new apartment buildings are coming up in my area. Seattle rent prices have been cooling down, and it actually saw a first time year-over-year decrease since the last year. If I sell, I can always come back in a few years and start renting, and start again. More importantly, I do not have to come back to Seattle.

On the other hand, I cannot much think of many reasons to keep a home when I am moving to a different country in this housing market. There re few things though...

1. If I keep my condo (and all the stuff that I have in my unit), I will always have a place in US where I can always come back and stay whenever I want. I won't have to worry about finding short-term rents or long-term rents, or setting into a new place. It is like having a safe place where I can always come back to.
2. Buying a home is stressful. Without 2 years job history, &amp; high-interest rates, buying the home again next year or in a few years might be difficult.
3. If for any miracle, home prices go up again like 10%/year for another year or two like it has been for past 5 years in my area, then I could be losing potential gains of $60k/year or so by keeping my condo and selling it later.

What do you guys think? Should I sell it? or should I not sell it? 

&amp;#x200B;

For the background info, I currently have $280k in my accounts, and selling home (+$200k) will make that to around $480k\~$500k. No major debts since they have been paid off. My current salary in US is around $300k/year but that won't matter as soon as I quit the job to leave US. I won't be getting that much in the other country that I am going to, and am planning to take a long rest due to personal reasons.",finance
crypto_currency,Victorieum - banking in a new way!,"Victorieum - this project is a platform that aims to change the scope of banking. That is, on this project there will be such things as innovative financial instruments that users will need to perform various operations. In addition, these financial instruments will provide users with ease of use in the first place.

This project will apply such technology as blockchain. I think about the advantages of this technology, many people know, but I will remind you again. The most important factor of this technology is decentralization. Also, through the use of smart contracts, the security of operations will be achieved. This security will be primarily in the security of personal data of users.

 Also, above all, the site will provide the possibility of lending. The problem of the modern world is known to all. This is a very high interest rate on the loan rate. As you can understand it is not permissible. That is why the project wants to solve this problem by making lower rates and issuing loans directly.  
Also, according to the project team, they give a guarantee on the stability of this platform. That is, the project will apply such algorithms, thanks to which aspects such as the speed of operations, as well as the stable operation of the project itself and the platform as a whole will be implemented.

In addition, the project will be ready to issue bank cards. These cards will be free. They will have different statuses, such as gold, silver and platinum cards. Consequently, different cards have their own advantages. Everyone will be able to choose for themselves what he really needs.

Also, this project will release a mobile application. With the help of which users will be able to use all the services of this platform. At the same time, it will be very convenient. Since at the present time, smartphones are at your fingertips and it will not be difficult for you to use it for your purposes in any place and at any time.",cryptocurrency
computers,My $1100 Rig suddenly started shitting itself overnight,"Disclaimer, I've been a reddit user for a long time but have never actually posted anything anywhere until now, so my bad in advance if this is the wrong place to put this or anything.  So just over two years ago, I built my gaming PC, the specs of which I'll leave below, and for two years, it's had almost no major issues or defects that have necessitated serious repair or replacement of hardware.  I booted it up last night looking to get on PUBG, and found the game repeatedly crashed on launch.  Figured it was strictly a PUBG issue, so I verified game files, tried it again, no dice.  Figured maybe it was just a bug in a new update, and decided to play rocket league instead.  Launched the game, I'll see the logo splash flash for about two seconds, and then the game crashes.  I discovered that I could not run a single game I owned on my computer.  At this point, I'm googling to see if maybe this is an issue with Steam, but soon realized I probably was in need of GPU driver updates, so I headed over to AMD's website, and downloaded the latest version of Adrenaline, and it FAILED to install.  I was getting pretty fed up at this point, so I just settled for the 18.9.3 version instead of the somehow newer or better 18.10.2 version.  Well, this made no difference at all, and games continued to crash.  This is where I ran out of ideas, and went to bed.  Fast forward to today, and I decided to reinstall the most recent version of Adrenaline, prior to the ones that had released most recently.  This worked, and my games would now launch, but from this point forward, my monitor, regardless of what programs were running, would freeze for about half a second every 5 or so seconds.  Oh, and at times, when trying to reboot, I am left staring at my ASUS boot screen, frozen and forced to perform a hard restart, which has never been a problem until now.  I don't know what to think.  All my fans are functional, so I don't believe cooling to be the issue.  I really am out of ideas, NONE of these issues have ever bothered me in the two years since I built this PC, and now it's just one problem after another.  Any suggestions or tips are massively appreciated.

Bitcoin,How to scale transaction broadcasting and fetching,"I'm working on a browser-based BTC wallet.

I understand that the original bitcoin core client (bitcoind) is not intended to be used across the network, except for whitelisted IP-addresses. This is due security concerns since a wallet can be safed on the bitcoin node.

However, in my case, the wallet is stored on the client/browser. Transactions are built within the browser wallet, but the browser depends on the node, for fetching transactions, UTXOs and broadcasting the transactions. Hence, no private keys or passwords are sent across the network.

What's the best way, to do this? Should I setup a full node? Are there any good bitcoin-node-as-a-services? Should I use alternative approches (such as [SPV](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Simplified_Payment_Verification))?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Receiving international wire transfer - Ally - Navy Federal (NFCU) - or BoA?,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm struggling in between choosing a bank account to receive a large amount of money from overseas since I don't really have experience with either Ally or NFCU.

&amp;#x200B;

**BoA**  
I've done a lot of times with BoA and I know they charge a fee of $16 every time, even my parents paid the fee and tick on OUR on the payment order at their bank =&gt; we will have to pay 2 times, from both sides. 

**Pros:** 

* I will receive the fund within the same day. 

**Cons:**

*  $16 fee from US bank and $50 from the overseas bank. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Navy Federal:** 

My parents sent a fund to me the day before yesterday and yet after calling NFCU 4 times, they failed to inform me whether or not I will see my fund any time soon. They said there is no scheduled transfer they could see from their end. And today marks the 3rd day.

Pros:

*  No fee to receive. That's what they claim.

**Cons:** 

* There is no SWIFT code, only routing number so it might be hard for you to send money from some banks from Asia, they  usually require SWIFT code.
* You can only send money in USD, or else you will have to work with another bank before sending it to NFCU
* Waiting time for the money to be deposited.

 I'm kinda worried since I received the successful transfer notification from the sender bank but as a receiver, I have heard nothing and have seen nothing coming to my bank. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Ally:**

So I just opened an account with Ally and I wish to receive international wire transfer there. That would save me some times to not have to transfer money back and forth from another account to my Ally saving. However, as I talked to different agents, I have learned that:

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros:** 

* You won't have to pay fee to Ally

**Cons:**

* They processed everything through Chase. So there might be fee you would have to pay to Chase or any other banks that process the fund. 
* There will be more paperwork required from the sender bank since Ally will be listed as the receiver and beneficiary bank at the same time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will need to receive another amount really soon (tomorrow) and right now I'm not sure which one I should go with. Choose BoA and save me some hassle? (going to the teller to get check or order check will cost me fee too but I don't wanna leave my money at BoA, there is no interest whatsoever). My wired fund at NFCU is still no where to be found.  


Anyone has experience receiving fund from overseas bank and has experienced with any of the listed bank? Thank you!",finance

Im looking for known online bank that consistently increases its interest rates, has secured website, preferably 2 factor authentication.  Someone recommended AE. Has anybody used them for savings before and what is your experience like?",finance
personalfinance,Would it make sense to take out loans?,"Posted this in r/college but did not receive any feedback, so hopefully I can get a helpful opinion here. 



Let me explain my situation before an opinion is made. And let me add some pointers.

-I do NOT qualify for FASFA. Only have once, and that was when my younger brother first started college 2 years back. Family makes *too much* and I'm only 23 still living at home and paying my own expenses. 

-I pay for my courses myself. 0 help from anyone or my parents at that(nothing new here). 

-I'm doing vocational school at this moment. 

I've decided to go back to school, and go back FT. I've earned my Associates 2 years ago and decided to wait on my Bachelors, due to financial circumstances. Instead of going to Uni, I decided to go back to my former community college and earn a certification in Electrical work(very similar to my college major), which is an 11 month program. 

Before I began school, I was working a nice FT office job and making a decent wage. I decided that's not what I wanted to do with my life. I saved up enough money to get me through the first semester of school, but that's only the first semester. 

The spring term has opened up for payments and is quickly approaching, but I have less than $400 in my savings right now. I've put my tuition on a payment plan and forwarded that plan to charge my Visa credit card at $335 a month for 4 months(this was for fall). Spring is going to be the same price with the exact same payments, but I'm afraid I cannot afford it. 

My current PT job is complete crap, and I'm looking for a second job. If I can find a second job by the time payments are due, then I'll be able to afford the payments no problem, but at this moment in time I cannot.

Scholarships. Let me just say, they're just like playing the lottery, but for free. I've applied for one and just got informed I did not win anything. I'm looking for others, but it's not as easy as I expected it to be. They all have specific requirements that have to be met, and I can't lie and say I have those requirements(live in X state, be X age, be this, etc). All the ones for my state, I keep getting denied because of my qualifications for FASFA are not met. 

Now I've looked at loans in the past, but I have never been a fan of them. The amount I'd need to make it through the next 8 months would only be $3,000, but I don't know how that would work out. I don't want to be charged hefty interest rates and I want to pay it back while I'm still in school. What to do??

*All* opinions are welcome.",finance
personalfinance,Need help understanding these account conditions,"I'm starting an emergency fund and to avoid having my money sit in the proverbial mattress i'm researching high interest savings/money market accounts. 

I found CIT an online bank that's FDIC insured and offers some (apparently) great interest rates [here](https://www.bankoncit.com/) with some conditions found 
[here](https://www.bankoncit.com/uploadedFiles/bankoncitcom/pages/Personal_Banking/Savings/SavingsBuilderFAQs.pdf). 

I've read through that PDF, please correct me if i'm wrong, this is what i'm understanding: 

* Need to deposit $100 to open the account and an additional $100 or more that first month to get an APY of 2.15%. 
* To maintain the 2.15% APY I need to deposit $100 or more every month

What's the difference between APY and interest? For the ""base"" tier I see a drastic difference 1.14% APY and .9% interest rate. I will be making the minimum deposits monthly but would like to understand this further.

What's going to be credited to my account monthly, APY or interest rate?",finance

personalfinance,Solar as 10 year investment option,"Massachusetts has some of the highest electricity rates, and the best incentives for solar, hear me out. 

I’m guessing I can get a 10kw system installed for about $35k ($3.50/watt). - 30% Federal credit and $1k Mass incentive would get that down to ~$24k let’s say. 

Instead of that $24k sitting in a low yield savings or bonds, pay cash for the solar. Mass has a 10 year credit program that pays you the wholesale rate of electricity for what you produce (SREC). Currently electric is $.22/kWh retail and they will pay you $.15/kWh. 

The panels should generate around 7kw per year, or about $1000 in cash, a return of around 4%, every year for 10 years. Year 10 with only 3% electric rate hikes each year would net $1400, or 5.8% on original investment. Electric rates in mass have doubled over the last 20 years, a consistent growth every year. 

Year 11 and beyond, you are essentially paying yourself the going rate of electricity. At $.30/kWh you’d be getting around $2000 in savings per year in electric bill credits, for the life of the panels, plus any rate increases. 

Lots of factors to take in to account, but for a low risk investment it seems like a decent idea. Any thoughts?",finance

gaming,Tribulations of a late millennial gamer. Producer Expectations? Blizzard..,"So I like many others scoffed at the idea of a mobile platform for Diablo. How does a company fall so off base from its consumers when it’s inherently clear almost all of them are PC or Console users.

But then it dawned on me after reading all the negative response.


Maybe we’re all falling out of an age bracket. Even at Blizzcon, Seeing the Q and A, it’s evident we’re all getting older and maybe we’re just not the target consumer base anymore. Least not the primary one.

Look we all started Diablo and the Warcraft franchise when we were young and Blizzard pulled bank out of us all. Created dedicated individuals to there brand. That being said, it’s the YOUNG CROWD that made Blizzard what it is today.

But a company can’t continue to do the same thing and expect to get a new consumer base. It needs to try new things. Explore different avenues while its revenue is good. Us aging gamers have things higher on the priorities list than gaming :/

Mobile gaming might just to be one of those avenues where by observation is a big fucking thing for young gamers. Why should we be angry. Everyone bitches it’s all about the money. We damn straight it’s about the money. It’s a private business. It’s always been about the money.

Let’s just be real about it. We won’t play the game and that’s fine. I’m sure Blizzard knows this. It’s also why they had Diablo 4 in the bag for later. It’s a prequel game even.

Let’s be constructive and understand that things change wether we like it or not. We just need to find platforms that cater to our demographic. Blizzard gave us many years of entertainment. Let’s just wish them the best if luck and ask that they don’t forget about those who gave them their success.",technology
personalfinance,Car Loan Conundrum,"Hi good people of r/personalfinance. Let me preface this by saying I am not a financially-saavy person, although I am capable of doing math. Generally my approach to money is just to not spend it. However my ex SO was on the opposite end of that particular spectrum and when we purchased a new car for me, he talked me into buying something a bit more expensive than I imagined. Also because I don't think I'm really awesome at finances, I let him handle the details of the loan. Yes, I realize this was a bad idea, but I trusted him and didn't anticipate our marriage exploding into a hellish fireball a few short months later.

Anyways.

Now I've got to get a handle on this shit and I noticed my car loan has a high interest rate (5.24%). I have 60 months left on the loan, pay $350 a month, and the current pay-off amount is $18,450. So, according to my simple math, the actual loan amount remaining is $21,009.

I received a quote for a refinanced loan that has a 4.24% rate, $298 per month for 72 months. Am I doing something wrong, or does this actually require me to pay more money in the end? Something like $500 more? The $50 reduction in the monthly payment is pretty meaningless to me. Is there a way for me to actually save money by refinancing?

Any advice welcome, thanks for reading.

personalfinance,How Can I Possibly Handle This Debt?,"Hi there, 
I'm a recent college grad with about 120k in debt. I know I shouldn't have gotten this far into debt now, but I can't change that at this point. I was given no guidance, and I have no way to excuse my behavior, because I have set myself back way too far to even think about a life outside of this debt. 

I graduated University with a BA in Psychology and a minor in Statistics. I have a current job with a 32k/year salary. I am not paying rent currently (living with parents), so my commute is 45 minutes each way. Hours are 9:30am-6:00pm. I don't have any credit card debt or anything. 

My father has agreed to help me pay minimum monthly payments or at least help monitor. (he makes 6 figures , yet never saved for my college, and told me to just take out a loan before college started, and has a lot of his own debts). 

The loans are separated into:

federal consolidated loan: $29,962 at 4.12%apr and $172/month for 20 years

4 private loans through Sallie Mae: 79,222 at average 7.00%apr at $876/month for 10 years

We have 2 refinancing options for the private loans through SoFi that are feasible:

1) 79,222 refinanced to a 7-year fixed apr at 5.524% at $1,149/month. Dad and I would agree to split these payments for the next 7 years... but that ties my dad into ostensibly a 7 year contract to pay off *my* debts until I make a substantially better paycheck. 
This would mean I'm paying $632 + $172 each month, while living at home while making $1928/month. For 7 years. But this puts all of my parent's plans of moving soon stop for 7 years. 

2) 79,222 refinanced to a 20-year plan fixed apr 6.18% at $588/month. This option is feasible for me to carry granted that I 1)stay at home longer, 2)put aside money 3) dad would agree to put a windfall on stock investments onto my debts on the agreement that I pay him back. 
This would mean I am paying $588 + $172 each month while making $1928/month for the foreseeable future... This means I'm paying more, but I have more time to bide for windfalls on either mine or my fathers side. It also means that I could *feasibly* carry the debt alone (which is what I should be aiming for) in case my dad CANNOT pay anything, or chooses not to help me any more. 

This seems insurmountable. I wanted to start my PhD program in the next 2 years (which is usually paid for and includes a stipend), but that does not look to be feasible with ANY of the options I have listed. Especially because programs in psychology are notoriously difficult to get into in my state of NC. 

Like I said. I only make 32k/year. And likely will make that amount indefinitely if I go to grad school -- ***Note*** grad school =/= more debt in my particular case. I am not going for law and/or med school. 

However, If I stick with this job for 2 years, and cannot get into grad school, I could probably get a job as a Research Coordinator that makes an average of $60k/yr. It could postpone my graduate school plans, perhaps indefinitely though. 

I'm in a very tough spot y'all, and I don't really think there's a way out of this. My two questions are 

1) which of the two options for refinancing the private loans seems like a better plan? 

2) Is going to a PhD program feasible in the next 2 years?",finance

Banks designed a system to punish people who own less and subsidize people who own more. The less money you have, the higher the costs to access banking services – from interest rates to account fees. If you are wealthy, most fees are waived and interest rates are low. This dichotomy keeps the underprivileged trapped in a vicious cycle out of which there is no escape. Solution?

investing,11/8 News (and predictions) of Day,"* The Dow rose 550 points yesterday and all sectors of the S&amp;P saw gains. Big winners were healthcare stocks (the Affordable Care Act will be impossible to repeal with a Democrat House), energy (regulations at the state level were rejected, putting less pressure on these companies), and technology (not totally sure, so input would be great, but I could only surmise that these companies may be expecting a less stringent business environment). Oil has been declining for awhile now and it looks like this is partly because of President Trump, or at least he claims responsibility for it, and his sanctions against Iran and demand is not as high as had been previously anticipated. Another note: be on the lookout for a Fed decision on rates today.
* Jeff Sessions ""resigned"" yesterday at the request of President Trump. The reason I put it in quotes is because I feel like he was going to get fired over Trump's open disapproval of Session's recusing himself from the Russian investigation. I don't know a whole lot about how White House politics work, but I would assume whenever someone resigns it's because a firing is imminent (could also be because Sessions couldn't stand Trump or didn't want the job anymore, but there are many possibilities). Oddly enough (or maybe not...), marijuana stocks soared after this announcement due to Session's anti-marijuana stance, and it also doesn't hurt that recreational marijuana was legalized in Michigan on Tuesday.

personalfinance,"Small Investment, worth it?","Hello,

I'm in my mid 30's and I've saved up about 30K. Recently I've been asked to finance a small cafè. I will be putting all the money to get the activity started, including works, machinery permits, etc... We are talking 20,000 USD more or less. My partner who found this opportunity will be the manager of the place (putting no money in at the beginning). He counts on having three employees running the place making his job just management activities that he will do while working another job.

He assigned himself a monthly salary for his job and 80% of the ownership of the cafe. I will be awarded a 20% of the cafe and will get revenues at the end of the year proportionally, about 10,000USD. Also the cafè will pay back my loan with a 6% interest rate in two years, generating 2000 dolalrs revenue.

Does this sound fair? I'm taking all the financia risk and if we go broke we will loose most of the investment as we are renting the place and the machinery is a small portion of the expense...

I would kindly appreciate your thoughts and suggestions,

Thanks!",finance

I want to use a home equity loan to pay off the debt but my husband was told that it was a poor financial decision so he is against it. We are more financially mature then we were years ago.

https://i.redd.it/ffouihpkz4x11.png

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged the founder of decentralized Ethereum exchange (DEX) EtherDelta with operating an unregistered exchange.

As a DEX, the crypto trading platform allowed users to trustlessly trade Ethereum-based tokens without registering accounts or entrusting their funds to an exchange-controlled wallet. Trading was managed by a smart contract, though the exchange relied on off-chain infrastructure maintained by its operator.

According to the SEC, the EtherDelta platform illegally allowed users to trade tokens that the SEC considers to be securities under federal law, making it an unregistered securities exchange.

btc,A Response to Roger Ver,"This post was inspired by the video “Roger Ver’s Thoughts on Craig Wright”. Oh, wait. Sorry. “Roger Ver’s Thoughts on 15th November Bitcoin Cash Upgrade”. Not sure how I mixed those two up.

To get it out of the way first and foremost: I have nothing but utmost respect for Roger Ver. You have done more than just about anyone to bring Bitcoin to the world, and for that you will always have my eternal gratitude. While there are trolls on both sides, the crucifixion of Bitcoin Jesus in the past week has been disheartening to see. As a miner, I respect his decision to choose the roadmap that he desires.

It is understandable that the Bitcoin (BCH) upgrade is causing a clash of personalities. However, what has been particularly frustrating is the lack of debate around the technical merits of Bitcoin ABC vs Bitcoin SV. The entire conversation has now revolved around Craig Wright the individual instead of what is best for Bitcoin Cash moving forward. 

Roger’s video did confirm something about difference of opinions between the Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV camps. When Roger wasn’t talking about Craig Wright, he spent a portion of his video discussing how individuals should be free to trade drugs without the intervention of the state. He used this position to silently attack Craig Wright for allegedly wanting to control the free trade of individuals. This appears to confirm what Craig Wright has been saying: that DATASIGVERIFY can be used to enable widely illegal use-cases of transactions, and Roger’s support for the ABC roadmap stems from his personal belief that Bitcoin should enable all trade regardless of legal status across the globe. 

Speaking for myself, I think the drug war is immoral. I think human beings should be allowed to put anything they want in their own bodies as long as they are not harming others. I live in the United States and have personally seen the negative consequences of the drug war. This is a problem. The debasement of our currency and theft at the hands of central banks is a separate problem. Bitcoin was **explicitly** created to solve one of these problems.

Roger says in his video that “cryptocurrencies” were created to enable trade free from government oversight. However, Satoshi Nakamoto never once said this about Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto was explicitly clear, however, that Bitcoin provided a solution to the debasement of currency.

&gt;“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.” 
– Satoshi Nakamoto 02/11/2009

As we’ve written previously, the genesis block is often cited as a criticism of the 2008 bailout. However, the content of the article outlines that the bailout had already occurred. The article reveals that the government was poised to go a step further by buying up the toxic bank assets as part of a nationalization effort! In this scenario, according to the Times, ""a 'bad bank' would be created to dispose of bad debts. The Treasury would take bad loans off the hands of troubled banks, perhaps swapping them for government bonds. The toxic assets, blamed for poisoning the financial system, would be parked in a state vehicle or 'bad bank' that would manage them and attempt to dispose of them while 'detoxifying' the main-stream banking system."" The article outlines a much more nightmarish scenario than bank bailouts, one that would effectively remove any element of private enterprise from banking and use the State to seize the bank's assets.

The United States is progressively getting to a point where cannabis can be freely traded and used without legal repercussion. As a citizen, each election has given me the opportunity to bring us closer to enacting that policy at a national level. However, I have **never** had the ability to have a direct impact on preventing the debasement of the United States dollar. The dollar is manipulated by a “private” organization that is accountable to no one, and on a yearly basis we are given arbitrary interest rates that I have no control over. The government uses its arbitrary control over the money supply to enable itself to spend trillions of dollars it doesn’t have on foreign wars. Roger Ver has passionately argued against this in multiple videos available on the internet.

This is what Bitcoin promised to me when I first learned about it. This is what makes it important to me. 

When the Silk Road was shut down, Bitcoin was unaffected. Bitcoin, like the US dollar, was just a tool that was used for transactions. There is an inherent danger that governments, whether you like it or not, would use every tool at their disposal to shut down any system that enabled at a protocol level illegal trade. They, rightfully or wrongfully, did this with the Silk Road. Roger’s video seems to hint that he thinks Bitcoin Cash should be an experiment in playing chicken with governments across the world about our right to trade freely without State intervention. The problem is that this is a vast underestimation of just how quickly Bitcoin (BCH) could be shut down if the protocol itself was the tool being used for illegal trade instead of being the money exchanged on top of illegal trade platforms. 

I don’t necessarily agree or disagree with Roger’s philosophy on what “cryptocurrencies” should be. However, I know what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is simply hard, sound money. That is boring to a lot of those in the “cryptocurrency” space, but it is the essential tool that enables freedom for the globe. It allows those in Zimbabwe to have sound currency free from the 50 billion dollar bills handed out like candy by the government. It allows those of us in the US to be free from the arbitrary manipulation of the Fed. Hard, sound, unchanging money that can be used as peer to peer digital cash IS the killer use case of Bitcoin. That is why we are here building on top of Bitcoin Cash daily. 

When Roger and ABC want to play ball with governments across the globe and turn Bitcoin into something that puts it in legal jeopardy, it threatens the value of my bitcoins. Similar to the uncertainty we go through in the US every year as we await the arbitrary interest rates handed out by the Fed, we are now going to wait in limbo to see if governments will hold Bitcoin Cash miners responsible for enabling illegal trade at a protocol level. This is an insanely dangerous prospect to introduce to Bitcoin (BCH) so early in its lifespan. In one of Satoshi Nakamoto’s last public posts, he made it clear just how important it was to not kick the hornet’s nest that is government:

&gt;“It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.” 
– Satoshi Nakamoto 12/11/2010

Why anyone would want to put our opportunity of sound monetary policy in jeopardy to enable illegal trading at a base protocol level is beyond me. I respect anyone who has an anarcho-capitalist ideology. But, please don’t debase my currency by putting it at risk of legal intervention because you want to impose that ideology on the world.

We took the time to set up a Q&amp;A with the Bitcoin SV developers Steve Shadders and Daniel Connolly. We posted on Reddit and gathered a ton of questions from the “community”. We received insanely intelligent, measured, and sane responses to all of the “attack vectors” proposed against increasing the block size and re-enabling old opcodes. Jonathon Toomim spent what must have been an hour or so asking 15+ questions in the Reddit thread of which we obtained answers to most. We have yet to see him respond to the technical answers given by the SV team. In Roger’s entire video today about the upcoming November fork, he didn’t once mention one reason why he disagrees with the SV roadmap. Instead, he has decided to go on Reddit and use the same tactics that were used by Core against Bitcoin Unlimited back in the day by framing the upcoming fork as “BCH vs BSV”, weeks before miners have had the ability to actually vote.
 
What Bitcoin SV wants to accomplish is enable sound money for the globe. This is boring. This is not glamorous. It is, however, the greatest tool of freedom we can give the globe. We cannot let ideology or personalities change that goal. Ultimately, it won’t. We have been continual advocates for miners, the ones who spend 1000x more investing in the network than the /r/btc trolls, to decide the future of BCH. We look forward to seeing what they choose on Nov 15th.

Roger mentions that it is our right to fork off and create our own chains. While that is okay to have as an opinion, Satoshi Nakamoto was explicit that we should be building one global chain. We adhere to the idea that miners should vote with their hashpower and determine the emergent chain after November 15th. 

&gt;“It is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid one. Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those who were not present of this. We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened. The CPU proof-of-worker proof-of-work vote must have the final say. The only way for everyone to stay on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, no matter what.”

personalfinance,Can I claim exempt on W4 and manually contribute my assumed tax liability?,"Some background first: I currently have a very aggressive strategy to avoid as many taxes as possible. Filing single on one income of about 44K. I max out my IRA, HSA, claim the AOTC, and contribute 20% of income to 401K. I have calculated my tax liability to be roughly $1.5-2k (Federal and California).  So at the moment, I am claiming 8 exemptions, but have already had almost $3K withheld. I used the IRS withholding calculator and, although they agreed with me that too much is being withheld at the moment, they suggested that I change my exceptions to 7. This is clearly wrong, as going **down to 7, as the IRS calculator suggested**, I would end up having even more withheld, not less. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hence this idea. Can I claim exempt to bypass whatever withholding calculations my company uses, and ask them to withhold a certain amount each paycheck so that it will approximate my tax liability at the end of the year as much as possible (line 6 on the W-4)? Or if I claim exempt, does that mean they will not withhold anything at all, even if I place something on line 6? What about checking next year once it has hit $2k, and then simply claiming exempt for the rest of the year? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I may be sounding crazy here, but it just seems like nothing is helping to minimize my refund at the end of the year. And I could claim even more exemptions, but I heard that anything past 10, the company submits it to the IRS and I don't want to invite any extra scrutiny that isn't necessary. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"Buy house cash, or get mortgage and invest the difference?","We're a couple in our early 30s, no kids, looking for advice about balancing housing vs retirement investments. Here's our situation:


-Combined income of ~$60k-80k/year gross (fluctuates based on work availability - but my salary of $60k is guaranteed and in a safe profession). Take-home pay after all deductions and premiums is about $3.5k-4.5k per month.

-Zero debt.

-Savings of ~$300k, currently sitting in US and foreign bank accounts (combination of years of savings plus a recent inheritance).

-We both studied for many years, so we don't have many retirement savings. $6k in a 401k (from one year of 5%+employer match) and small pensions from a few years in previous jobs outside of the US (impossible to predict what they'll pay out in 30+ years, but it is unlikely to be more than $100-$200 per month in today's money).


We currently rent, and are house hunting because we want to settle down here (metropolitan area in Florida). At the same time, our retirement savings may be on the low side. So we're trying to decide between paying cash for a house (somewhere around the $200k-$250k ballpark) or getting a mortgage with $100k down and putting most of the rest into investments for retirement (Roth IRAs and/or brokerage accounts). 

Our financial advisor at my workplace is pushing us down the mortgage + investment route, but we're worried he may be most concerned with selling us investment products, and is overstating how likely investments are to beat the current ~5% interest rate on mortgages. 

If we do buy cash, that would free up $750 in our monthly budget that we currently spend on rent ($1350 - $600 in property tax and insurance for a house in our price range), and we would invest most of that in retirement savings (the 401k or IRAs etc.), with the rest going towards home maintenance.

personalfinance,31 year old looking for life/retirement/investment advice on my current situation.,"Quick summary (sorry for formatting i am on mobile) I grew up poor in a single family home with an alcoholic mother. I learned the value of a dollar when i was ypung and i have tried to live frugally my whole life to better prepare me for the future. Imo life is a snowball and faster i get that snowball rolling the more finacially comfortable i can be. Also i HATE oweing people/banks money. A lot of my philosophy with finance is about efficiency.

 --------------- about me ----- I am a 31 year old male. I went to schhol for emt/paramedic/firefighter I worked throught college along with living cheaply and made it through college with very little debt which i immediately paid off. I ended up working at doctors offices. I currently make 18.50 an hour and get between 35- 40 hours a week. I bought a used 2006 prius slightly under blue book value which i paid cash for. I have the cheapest auto insurance possible to save money. I also have no health insurance ( had it 6 years, used it once, it didnt cover anything because of my deductible and decided it was a waste of money) My job offers a 401k which i contribute 6% and my company matches 4% this is the max the company will contribute. In 2015 i bought a 4 bedroom 2 bath house. It was a fixer upper in a nice neighborhood. I purchased the home for 80,000 the home was appraised at 85,000. Its now been almost 4 years, ive spent 20,000 on renovations and my home was recently appraised at 165000. I got a 30 year fixed 3.9% interest rate morgage. My morgage includes insurance, property taxes, interest, and principal( i refinanced 16 months ago to drop the pmi morgage insurance off of my morgage payment) My current minimum morgage payment is 600 a month. I do however additional payments to the principal every month since i purchased the house. I also rent out 3 of my spare bedrooms for an additional 1320$ a month which i put roght on the principal I currently only owe 40,000 left on the house and with my current setup i should be able to pay it off in less then 2 years. Between home owner insurance and interest paying off my house should save me about 300$ a month.

 ------------ my numbers----- (i tend to under estimate income and over estimate bills so i am more prepared for the unexpected)--------

 -------------- my numbers-----
 2000$ income from work 
1320$ income from roomates
 3320 total monthly income
 ------ expenses---------- 
600 morgage
 1320 Additional principal payment
 300 electric
 80 internet 
100 water/sewage 
35 natural gas
 75 car insurance 
100 gas 
100 bad habits
 250 food 
200 entertainment

The remaining balance then goes into savings/emergency fund (about 200 a month)
Currently i have 120k equity in my home Own a car worth 6k I own 0.5 bitcoin Have about 8000 in my 401k Have 2000 in savings/emergency fund

And total debt is currently 40k
My current goal for the last few years has been renovate my house to increase the value and pay down my morgage so one day i can live for relatively cheaply. I am on track to have my house fully paid off in 2 years. Once i pay off my house my goals will shift i will be maxing out my 401k and for the rest of the extra money i have 3 things in mind. 1) invest in stocks depending on the market. 2) open my own small business involving a gaming bar of some sort. Or/and 3) invest in more real estate. Looking into the future for retirement and financial comfort i would love to find a way to generate passive income. I have had great success with my current property and i would love to own a few houses to rent out for passive income. I am also super interested in stocks and dividends but me nor any of my family have any knowledge of stocks.

So my questions are, how am i doing so far? What can i do better? What would you recommend i do currently to put future me in a better situation? Any advice on stocks/ dividend paying stocks?",finance
personalfinance,I think I’ll owe taxes next year for the first time in years!!!!!,"I left my withholdings at Married 1 for me and my spouse after the new withholding tables came out last February. With the new tax tables, I’ve estimated my taxes and I’ll owe almost $4k!  In the past this gave me a few hundred or so refund. 

Here are the highlights:

Gross Income 220k less PT deductions is 172k W2 wages with 17k federal withholding 
3k of other income is 175k AGI

I’m itemizing which limit state deductions to 10k, mortgage interest 19k and charity 14k totals 43k.  This leaves 131k taxable income and 21k tax.   If I wasn’t able to itemize as the new tax plan intended I’d owe 8k!

I’ve done this same Calc in past years with the only change being state tax deduction limit and no personal exemptions.  

I’m hoping something is wrong in my calculations but I’m wondering if others are seeing this. I’d really appreciate any advice!

gaming,Red Dead Redemption 2 is terrible after the epilogue [obvious spoilers],"\&gt;!I finished it last night and tried to do some things and it felt empty and almost like I was betraying all of the things I did with Arthur.

I don't want to play at all as John Marston.

While I appreciate the menial tasks of Beecher's Hope and it will set up nicely for RDR online as I have a group of friends that no shit want to have a ranch for some reason... I honestly could not give less of a shit about the open world in singleplayer now.

It is kind of cool to hunt down Micah with Arthur's guns and wear Arthur's hat and sort of pay tribute to him, but I just feel dirty riding around with Arthur's satchel, using Arthur's guns, I even have his damn clothes. Sure, I've got like 20 grand from Micah's stash on the mountain and I can just go do whatever I want and remake myself, but it isn't fun.

I even went and got John a haircut and shave and he looks stupid. I used to like going to the barber to get my left parted fade done right and make sure my level 7 length mustache stayed just so. You know what John Marston looks like without a beard and with a side part? He looks like a tool. He looks like a tool that would put up with Abigail's neverending nonsense, so I guess maybe he looks just right. But it isn't fun, at least not as fun as having Arthur was.

I knew when Arthur was going to die. I dressed him up in his finest blue suit. I polished his guns. I fed his Ardennes, Françoise for the last time. I did the last mission and the Epilogue and then the credits roll and you see where Charles buried him in a lovely spot with a lovely marker and Mary is visiting his grave and crying and the game rips your heart out one last time.

Then you get magically teleported back to Abigail chewing John's ass about some more nonsense or maybe not but at that point, I was ignoring every word out of her mouth. You gave us this mountain of a character in Arthur, then you kill him, then gave us a decent epilogue and solid final retribution, but then you throw us into the void with a character who is defined primarily by the actions of the one that just died and he's basically pointless without Arthur. I kind of hate him because of it. What the fuck, Rockstar?!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Best piece of advice I have for any player that hasn't finished the game is to do everything you can with Arthur. I mean everything. Hunt all of the animals, get all of the clothes, get all of the guns, catch all of the fish, meet and complete all of the stranger's missions, do every single possible thing in the game except until all that's left is the last mission and epilogue. Ideally, you want to hit 100% when you finally finish the last epilogue mission.",technology

personalfinance,Stuck in a rut with credit cards. Need advice getting out of debt.,"So long story short, I've been dealing with health issues since March and have ended up racking up a significant amount of debt. I work in sales and while being in the hospital or feeling so queazy that I was in the bathroom, it killed my commission and now I'm in a huge hole. It started by having to pay large amounts of hospital bills (some for over a thousand at a time) on short notice and I would pay them using my credit card. Not a big issue at first, but my issue went on much longer than i could have ever imagined and next thing I know, I've maxed a credit card.

&amp;#x200B;

I already had a second card, so I transferred the balance to not pay interest (0% APR on transfers for a year) and have been paying it down each month. However, things kept going, hundreds kept coming in bills, and I started having to use my card for things like groceries, gas, and other simple needs. Now I sit here after 8 months and have one credit card maxed, one nearing its cap, and I've made so little this year that I'm struggling to make ends meet. I also had a furniture loan from a little over a year ago that was 0% APR if paid in full in 12 months. That expired and the interest that I would've saved was tacked onto the loan and it's a 33% APR. It jumped my balance up to around $3k.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to bust my ass to make more money at work, but with the winter months upcoming, I'm scared I won't get enough traffic to help myself since I sell cars. I've done some things to lower my monthly expenses like getting different auto insurance, moving to a new place when my lease was up, and lowering my phone bill. All in all, I've cut about $250/mo out of my costs. I'm still looking to cut a little more, but really just need to stop the interest from killing me. Last year, I made $36k doing my job and I'm pacing around there this year. I can make payments on everything I have to pay, but it's not enough to make a large enough payment to stop the interest from really piling up.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured taking out a personal loan on a lower APR would be my way out, but I've been declined multiple times due to high revolving lines of credit. So essentially, I'm trying to kill these cards by getting a loan, but can't get a loan because of the cards. I can strap down and budget myself if I can stop the high APR, I just don't see a way out right now.

&amp;#x200B;

If you need any more info to help, I'm happy to give it. Any advice is appreciated and I really need to find a way out.

Banking,My business is due to refinance our loans by the end of the year. Looking for advice on how to get the best loan from 2 competing banks that both really want our business.,"Tried over in r/personalfinance and did not receive any feedback. Let me know if you think there is better subreddit please!

I have been working with my family for 18 years. My wife and I  are managing all aspects of the business now. We have a 7 year loan coming to a re-trigger and although there is a lot of talk about short term interest rates going up, the longer term rates are still very good compared to historical averages. 
Without going to far into it, I have a loan with one bank for about 400K. My Parents have a loan with another bank for about 1.6M. We work seasonally in the commercial fisheries in Alaska and each make one annual loan payment. We are looking to consolidate our debts into one loan in order to leverage our collective business and lock in a good rate for another 5 or 7 years.
Currently have an offer on the table for:   
* 15 year payment schedule  
* 0.5% initiation fee(seems like 1% is standard)  
* 5 year fixed rate at 5%  
* 7 year fixed rate ""in the low 5's""  
* No prepayment penalty  
* Annual Payments that can be made at any time in the year.  

We are feeling pretty good with the offer on the table but I know both banks really want our business. Its important to note that our revenue stream is unique because we get large sums of money in a short period of time (seasonal industry). We have always made annual payments. Years ago I started making my mortgage payments weekly instead of monthly and it saves something crazy (50K) over the life of the loan in interest paid. Could this same principal apply to our business loans? I tried messing with some Excel workbooks for business loans, adjusting the payments per year feature but I didn't notice any difference in total interest paid. 

In summary, my main query is how to go about negotiating the best possible loan terms considering we have banks willing to compete for the business (also feedback on the proposed terms). I would also appreciate advice/insight on single annual payments vs. a monthly/quarterly schedule. Thanks for any insight!",finance

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 32 yo doctor, completing a residency in radiology (will be complete 7/2020) and have already matched into a 1 year fellowship in Musculoskeletal radiology (complete 7/2021). Afterwards, the place I am completing my fellowship has already said they would offer me a job. (obviously, nothing is official) My wife, is a 30 yo dentist who has been in practice for almost 4 years and recently bought a practice (\~6months ago).  

Ok, a little about our INCOME.  I earn a resident salary in California \~70K/yr, which is not that bad actually as far as residents salary go. As mentioned before my wife recently bought a practice , so her yearly income is currently changing. Her first year out of practice, she earned just under 100K, then it has slowly been rising and she will probably make \~170k. Ok, so combined 245k. After taxes I take home \~47k and she takes home \~83K, so combined \~130K/yr or \~10.5/mo. I know to many people, this sounds like a lot, even to me, but somehow we still practically live paycheck to paycheck and we are not even paying back our student loans fully yet.  We would like to buy a house and have kids sometime soon, so we want to come up with a plan of how to save more, reduce costs, and hopefully some other good ideas. 

And now the monthly EXPENSES:

We live in southern California, we do not own a house(2100$ Rent)

Lease 2 cars(\~900$ combined)

gas 200$ (we both have an hour commute each way)

wife's dental practice loan (1800$)

My student loan (100$ while a resident/fellow, will be much higher after graduate)

\-more info on my loans: I recently refinanced through SoFi @ \~5.2% loans were previously 6.8%. My plan was to utilize SoFi's 

My wife's student loan (900$, will be at least 2k starting 2019 given her increased income)

Gym memberships (75$ for both)

Cell phones (140$)

Medical expenses(surgery payment and prescriptions) 100$

Dental Association 150$

Cable/Hulu/Sling/CBS/internet- 165$ (I think i could reduce this to 105$)

Credit Card Debt Loan- 1200$ (This was mostly racked up during college and medical school. My mother paid off this debt before the interest rate raped us, and agreed to pay her back at a set rate. At the current rate of repayment we will be finished 8/2019, so like 9 more months)

Food-600$(combination of groceries (100/wk)and eating out(dinner dates)

Utilities- 100$

Ok these are the bulk of our expenses which, if I added correctly equals \~8400$/month. There are usually  miscellaneous expenses each month, that we try to reduce, but it is not uncommon to have expenses \~9k.  As above our income equals about 10.5k. I try to put 1-2k away in savings/mo and have done so for the past 4-5 months, but if any unexpected expenses come up, then savings gets scrapped. For making almost 250K combined income, you would think that we would have more for savings, but no. I have many friends that went into business and are earning 200-250K per year, however they have no or little student debt and have ben earning  for the past 5 or so years. I have to admit it is mildly depressing working so har over the past almost15 years in undergraduate school, medical school, internship and now residency to realize that its going to take another 15 years to dig myself out. Im hoping people have a few ideas. 

Lastly, the upcoming changes can be expected: My wife will likely continue to earn a little more each year and I will get a job mid year 2021, hopefully earning anywhere between 200-300k/yr (pretty conservative estimation).

personalfinance,29 and Debt Free. Now what?,"TLDR: I have just finished paying off all of my debt.  I have 30K in savings and save 2K-3K a month.  What do I do know?

Financial Situation detailed:  29 years old. I have 0 debt.  I just finished paying off student loans. I rent my house, no car payment, no credit card payment, etc.  I have 4K in an ""untouchable"" checking account and 25K in my personal checking account where I save 2K-3K a month depending on if I buy plane tickets or whatever.  I have 4K in crypto and don't want to put any more (or less) into that.  My job is extremely stable (government) and I contribute 5% to Roth TSP with 5% match.  I don't mind having a 2 month emergency fund (aka the 4K account) due to the stable job.

Questions (yes I read the wiki):

Should I max out my Roth TSP? Wiki seems to say yes.  My plan was to up my contribution to 15% + 5% match and just kind of leave it at that.  I could dump the necessary funds to max out this year (10K-14K) but that obviously makes that money more untouchable if I wanted to buy a house or a new car or whatever.  Am I actually an idiot if I'm not maxing this?

Should (how do) I invest?  Wiki seems to say that money you invest should be considered gone for at least 5 years.  I have friends say that money sitting in your bank account is just you losing money (inflation) and to keep your checkings as low as you feel comfortable with since you can get access to your equity with stocks within a week.  Other friends say wait for the market correction, and then dump all you have into the stock market.  Is leaving my money in my checking account till the market crashes a viable strategy (yes I know you can't predict the future)?  If I were to invest I'd prefer a dump and forget over researching stocks every month (so mutual funds? wiki seems to not be a fan of these).

**Most importantly how do I get help without getting scammed?** I went to a financial adviser to basically go over this reddit post but felt like the guy was trying to sell me something pretty quick (wki seems anti adviser).  Get the same impression with most online helps.  Seminars seem to be, ""How to get to where Jehrfeur is!"" not what to do now.  I know the next 5 years can have a greater impact on my financial future than the rest of my life combined so I would really like not to screw this up.

Edit:  Thanks for all the advice. Current plan is to: 1. Max out my Roth TSP 2. Move my savings account from a standard account to one with a high (2%) interest rate. 3. Start investing in low-cost index fund of my choice. Truthfully thank you to all who responded. It may seem simple, but it helped probably a lot more than you realize.",finance

I mean since all of them have been paid on time each month and are technically paid for my credit score is in the 630s which isn't bad considering I haven't even opened a credit card.

Just received a 40k job offer (entry level) where I \*believe\* the 401k kinda sucks. But I would appreciate any help in case I'm misinterpreting:

After a 6 month period for FT employees:

Employer Contribution: 5% of annual salary (employer contribution begins on the 1st day of the 1stquarter after the employee’s 6 month anniversary); employee contributions: Voluntary up to federal limits

Loans: Available; Vesting Schedule: 33% after 2 yrs; 67% after 3 yrs; 100% after 4 yrs

I will not be at this job for more than 2 years (leaving for grad school). There aren't many other benefits, so I am considering waiting for a better offer unless I can negotiate the salary up higher. Am I interpreting this correctly?

thanks for any help!

personalfinance,Changing jobs. Budgeting advice for a 24 year old,"Hi PF,

I recently accepted a higher paying job and am waiting to start. I figured I would share the news here and ask for some budgeting advice as I head into a higher paying position.

Background details

24 year old single male, job is located in NYC, live in NJ.

**Current job details:**

75k Base pay (10-12k variable year end bonus)

**New Job Offer:**

105k base pay (15-20% variable year end bonus)

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I am very fortunate to obtain a job offer that pays this well for only being out of college for 2.5 years. I want to save as much as possible, in as smart of a way as possible so I can retire early (FIRE).

I currently take home around 4k per month after taxes and 10% contribution into my 401k. My new job will pay \~8150 per month before tax so I estimate I will take home around 5500 per month after taxes and 401k contributions.

I currently have around 17k in my 401K and 16k in a Roth IRA. Additionally I have around 2500 in a high yield saving account (should be higher) and around 3-4k in miscellaneous cryptocurrencies. 

I have about 36k outstanding in student loan debt with variable interest rates from around 3.5 to 5.7%. No CC dept or any other debt.

&amp;#x200B;

My current monthly budget is as follows:

Rent: $400

Car Payment: $444.22 (sad that its higher than rent)

Monthly Food (I eat out a lot): $300

Misc spending: $150

Student loan payment 1: $288

Student loan payment 2: $170

Parking at train station: $225

Car insurance: $142

Monthly train pass: $84

Cell phone: $70

Gym: $20

Spotify: $10

Total: $2300-2400

&amp;#x200B;

This should leave me with at least 2K-2500 per month in excess money. I am wondering what my best approach is for making the most of it. My plan is to continue to max employer contribution to 401k and my Roth IRA. Additionally, I think the best approach will be to save up about 10k in my savings and then put every bit of excess money into my student loan debt to knock it out all together.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know thoughts about this plan and if there is anything else I am missing, I have spent some time studying the whole flowchart but I admittedly am probably missing something.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks 

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,"Estimated Tax Return, Difference Between Federal Withholding and Social Security Employee? New Tax Reform?","Hello! I remember posting a similar post to this sub a coupule years ago, but I'm still (sadly) clueless as ever about taxes. I'm 20 years old and had a part-time job for the first half of this year and I'm wondering what all these words on my pay stub mean. Every time it comes to something like taxes, or APR on my credit card, medicare, all this stuff, I find myself really really wishing there was a course for all of this in high school or before we needed it. I feel really helpless because I know I'm supposed to do something with this but I'm not sure how and what. If anyone could please help me, I'd really really appreciate it. 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, Here are my YTD numbers on the last paycheck I got. 

Total YTD Earnings: $19,457.00

Total YTD Federal Withholding: $1,913

Total YTD Social Security Employee: $1,206.33

Total YTD Medicare Employee: $282.13

&amp;#x200B;

From my pay stub, I can see that $3,401.46 got subtracted from my YTD earnings to the above categories, and I received $16,055.54 total. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions are:

\-  How would my tax return be calculated? 

\-  What should I expect to get back? 

\-  What is this new tax reform that I'm seeing on all these tax return estimators? 

\-  Should I be fine filing my own taxes (like I did 2 years ago) with Turbotax online or should I use a CPA? 

\-  What's the difference between federal withholding and social security employee? 

\-  I used to hear about how social security is running out and there won't be any of it left for my generation when we get older. How true is this and if this is the case, why am I paying taxes for it? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm currently living on my own for uni but I'm pretty sure I'm still dependent under my parents. 

I feel like I should really know more about this, but whenever I try to look it up online I get so confused by all the different terms and wordings. Could somebody ELI5 this for me please? Thank you in advance!",finance

economy,Fed rate hikes: any surprises?,"[The US dollar](https://fxpro.news) has turned to growth this week following its previous decline in uncertainty. First of all, the risks of unpleasant surprises due to the elections are now gone and the results were close to predictions. Often, subsequent to elections, the currency and stock market of the country experiences some upswing, which was also evident this time, since key American indices added more than 2%.

Despite a small decline immediately after the announcement of the election results, the U.S. dollar has turned to growth, adding 1.2% to the Wednesday lows.

&amp;#x200B;

The growth wave of the dollar on Thursday supported the Fed. Keeping the policy unchanged, the U.S. Central Bank called the economy ""strong"" and highlighted the need to maintain its course to gradual rates hiking. Regarding the comments relating to the decision, there was only one cautions moment, about slowing business investments. Such approach has caused yield growth for short-term government bonds that support demand for a dollar as a more yielded currency.

The increase in the dollar due to higher interest rates usually has a negative impact on the demand for developing country currencies and commodities. This week we saw a decrease there, despite the growing demand for risks at American exchanges.

It won't be surprising to witness the development of this trend soon, as the events with the greatest potential risks for the dollar (Employment report, Elections, FOMC decision) are already behind.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, it is worth mentioning that over the past month the markets have become less believing that the Fed will produce more than three increases in rates next year. Latest data from CME’s FedWatch tool indicate that investors are considering a 27.8% chance to see more than three hikes, against 31.5% a month earlier.

Empowering of this trend could undermine the dollar belief over the long-term perspective.",finance

[The People's Bank of China is the central bank of the People's Republic of China responsible for carrying out monetary policy and regulation of finance](https://i.redd.it/0bqzxuk2yax11.png)

As China introduces blockchain technology to the financial platform in Xiong'an New Area (a development hub for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei economic triangle), the People's Bank of China(PBC) recently recognises the application of blockchain in some industries in its working paper.

&amp;#x200B;

[The People's Bank of China is the central bank of the People's Republic of China and is located in Beijing](https://i.redd.it/uuyeaizfyax11.png)

The article mainly studies the economic functions of blockchain by explaining blockchain technologies from an economic perspective, analysing the functions of smart contract and the performance and security of blockchain systems.

The analysis holds a positive attitude towards tokens’ function which is based on machine consensus. Tokens can be directly used as a payment tool in exchange for commodity or service inside or outside blockchain. A token’s function can also be defined by the rules within a certain blockchain. Besides, whenever transactions happened, the UTXO of different parties can be updated at the same time. 

Thus as tokens are traded, no trusted third party need to get involved and it wouldn’t cause risk to the capital on the way or the transaction itself, which differs from the peer-to-peer network where the false date, evil attack and out of syndication always happen. 

There is a description in the analysis of blockchain’s ability to effectively track the origin of statistics. It is because any modification in the blockchain is not allowed, which not only supports auditing but also lowering the risk of the operation. 

[Zhong Xu, a reseacher at the People's Republic of China and one of authors of a working paper recently released by the PBC recognizing blockchain technology](https://i.redd.it/ho9vexvpyax11.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Authors from PBC summarised that blockchain can provide more solutions for the banking and finance industry in China especially for the creative application in digital receipt.

As for the blockchain applications not involved with tokens, the public ledger helps solve the information asymmetry between participants and promote productivity. In that case, the paper suggests that a consortium blockchain will better suit this kind of applications than a public blockchain. It is because a consortium blockchain is only open to authorised nodes which jointly maintain the consensus. Evil attacks will harm their reputation which discourages them from adding false information to the blockchain. 

It goes further discussing the smart contract in terms of its functions like the property right, processed related to tokens, vote, mortgage, frozen assets, etc. The smart contract can be able to support the complicated function of management.

The paper also pointed out that over the past decade since Bitcoin was launched in 2009, DApps were mainly applied in the industries like the game, lottery, crypto asset trade, etc., instead of the entity economy. Blockchain technology hasn’t been fully utilised and there’s still a long way to go.

personalfinance,Balance transfer card recommendations?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I've hit a financial wall recently. I've got about 10k in cc debt and 6k in a personal loan. Both cards are capital one.

The promotion I was supposed to get has not come through yet, not expecting it for another couple months now... and I'm spending over 100% of my income. 

I tried getting a side gig up and running, but some health problems have put an end to that. My other expenses have been cut down to the bare bones- there's nothing I can cut out. 

Making minimum payments on the cards, but they keep going up and I can't afford it much longer. We're putting groceries and the water bills on the one card that isn't maxed out yet. 

I've looked into refinancing the house for a cash out but interest rates are too high at the moment.

Only thing I can think to lower my payments and give me time for my raise to come through is transferring the balance to a 0% apr transfer card. It can't be capital one- does anyone have any good recommendations for a card through another company?

While general advice is also appreciated i'm not looking for alternative budgeting solutions- there is nothing that can be cut out of my current expenses. The cc debt and loan payments are what are killing us right now, and they're the only things I can try to lower at the moment.

Thank you!",finance
investing,11/9 News (and predictions) of Day,"* The Fed concluded its meeting yesterday and decided to hold rates steady between 2% and 2.25% and they are expected to next raise them in December. President Trump has recently criticized Chairman Powell for the increases, claiming that future increases could slow economic growth. I personally think Trump needs to let Powell do his job and allow the Fed to remain an independent body but this is nothing new given that many past presidents have openly expressed disapproval of the Fed's actions. I also think the Fed is doing the right thing by raising rates so the economy does not overheat like it did back in the early days of the housing crisis thanks to Greenspan's policy of keeping rates too low.
* Democrats right now are looking to raise tax rates. Wonder why? In an attempt to finance the infrastructure plan that could be a bipartisan effort, they see this as more desirable than having to dive into a deeper deficit. I would have a hard time seeing republicans getting behind a hike in tax rates after the recent tax cuts, so the democrats may need to look elsewhere. With that said, if an infrastructure plan isn't agreed upon this raises the question as to whether other key issues will get addressed or if there will just be complete gridlock. It's going to be interesting to see what happens in this Congress and how it ends up affecting the overall economy.
* Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) may be joining the S&amp;P 500 at some point, but it first needs to meet some criteria: Have GAAP profitability for a year, a market cap of $6B, and the value of its market cap trade annually. While the last two points are already checked off, I'll be curious to see when the first one is achieved. Tesla has only ever only reported three profitable quarters, so it might take some time to reach that. From what I've found, companies that join the S&amp;P 500 usually gain 6% when the news is announced, but I'm not 100% sure if that boost would necessarily be sustained growth or merely a soar from the news announcement. What joining the S&amp;P would mean, however, is more investors for Tesla, so that aspect of it could possibly lead to more long-term growth.",finance

personalfinance,Best bank for combo checking - money market - possible CD,"Hello,

I am looking for a bank to maximize our interest rates. I currently get 0% on checking, have a savings account with a separate institution (not offering checking), and retirement accounts with Vanguard.

I am looking for an institution that will offer a checking account and money market/savings account that I can quickly transfer money to and out of. I tend to keep a good amount of cash on hand and having it sit at 0% seems dumb, so I would like the possibility to have checking and MM/savings at the same institution in order to have near immediate transfers available (it now takes 3-4 business days).

Until now, I have only found Cit Bank that has a decent interest rate without high deposits (2.15% on savings). Does anybody have any suggestions?

Thanks",finance
personalfinance,"First time home buyer, is this a fair rate?","My wife and I live in Southern California and we started escrow on our first home yesterday.  The house is 700k and we are putting 20% down and both have excellent credit, one of us is just below 800 and one is above 800. We are using a loan broker who was referred to us.  We trust him, other people trust him, and my realtor trusts him – this is our first time doing this thing.  How do I know I am getting the best mortgage rate? We haven’t signed any finalizing paperwork as of yet.  All we did was get our offer accepted and onto the next step we go.

For a 30 year fixed we were quoted 5.375 as the “worst rate” we were going to get.  He was waiting to see if a couple things could fall into place to hopefully get us a 5.125 – since we have such a solid package.  I’ve been told that our loan is considered a conforming “high balance” loan (loan amount is 560k) so it’s a bit different than a standard conforming loan, but, not quite a jumbo loan.

The confusion lies when I look online at rates.  Bankrate seems to be the most popular site from my limited research on this topic.  But, when I put in all of our loan details to get rates, I see a lot of 4.6’s-4.9’s (claiming no additional points).  When I check local banks and credit unions they seem to be more on par what I’m being quoted by our broker.  Low to mid 5’s.  


The little caveat to our situation is that the seller wants to close quick, which our company ABSOLUTELY CAN do (probably under 30 days).  I’m worried if I start shopping around and switch lenders that I’ll get dicked around and the deal will fall through.

I know rates have gone up recently but do those interest rates (5.375) sound fair for the type of loan we are getting?",finance

personalfinance,Yet another paying down debt question.,"Hello!  


I need advice on how to pay down my debt.

I have a lot of debt from being a student (my parents paid for the classes, I paid for everything else while only working 1-2 times per week). I have my first degree in psychology and a second degree in nursing.. not making excuses.. But I also fully supported myself and partner for the past year while he has been unemployed and we just moved 3 times this year (moved to a different province for an opportunity but missed family too much so we moved back to be close to family).... so lots of debt.

Debt is as follows (all cards are basically maxxed):

Credit card #1, 19.99%: $6,100

Credit card #2 13.99%: $19,500

Credit card #3 11.99%: $10,000

Credit card #4: $2,800, this was an amazon chase visa - they closed so there is no interest rate just a minimum payment due per month until the balance is 0 then the account will be closed. Since there is no interest on this card I will be paying it off last.

Education Line of Credit at 5.45%: $30,0000

My total: $65,600

&amp;#x200B;

I am also helping my partner pay down his CC balances,   
CC #1: 21.99%, $7,000  
CC #2: 21.99% (gone to collections) $2,300

I did not know he was missing payments and he told me after one card went to collections...

I am an RN full time and also work part-time as an admin assistant for a cardiologist so I make roughly $4000-$6000 a month take-home. $550 of that goes to rent (living with my best friend in a house her dad left her in Toronto but we have to do and pay for all the renovations of the basement to make it liveable) and telephone, electricity and internet bills are roughly $230-$300 per month (water is billed bi-monthly so every second month the utility bill is higher). Groceries are \~$100 a month as I do all the grocery shopping for my parents so in return they tell me to put whatever groceries I need on their bill as well (I am a lucky gal I know). We do not get take-out or eat out anymore in order to cut expenses.

My expenses are roughly $1000/month so I have $3000-$5000 to put toward debt and renovations and I want to know how to do it right.

I will still need to use money toward renovations so we can live in the basement of this house, my partner is doing all the renos and not working as any profession he could get would pay less than if he were to work and we pay a professional to do the renovations, this is our current logic and once the renos of the whole house are done he will return to work.

My plan is to pay down my cards from highest interest rate card first. I am going to apply for a loan after my probation period is up at work (January 2019) and move my CC debt onto the low interest rate loan then close the CC's. I will pay the minimums required for his cards for the time being.

Other than what strategy I should use to pay down debt I want to know should I use money directly from my checking account when I get paid in order to pay for renovations or should I pay it onto a credit card then use the card to pay for expenses?",finance
personalfinance,Bank won't open a credit card with legal name because of a dash,"My brother has a dash in his legal name. He just opened a new joint account with his new spouse a month ago.

If it's not, will this cause problems in the future in terms of people verifying his identity or getting the card added to his credit report? He and I are not sure if he's just being a stickler for rules or if he should be seriously concerned/alarmed.

personalfinance,Student loans and Tax offset questions,"My wife has a federal student loan she took out under her name prior to us being married. Her parents were paying on it all these years and lately have missed payments here and there and it ended up going to default. She didnt even know this loan existed until just recently we got a letter saying she was going to be hit with tax offset because its in default and to work with XYZ repayment collection company to get back into good standing etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we know about this loan I have taken it over from her parents and started working with the collection company to get her loan back out of default but since were now married if she gets hit with a tax offset that will affect us both since were married filing jointly so Im not sure what can be done if shes hit with a tax offset what can be done to protect MY tax return since its lumped together. I have about 7 more payments to go to get out of default status and at which point I should not have to worry about tax offsets as long as I continue to make payments.

&amp;#x200B;

So thats my question:

1. Wife is going to be hit with a tax offset for a student loan she took out prior to our marriage because it went into default. Since were filing married jointly and a tax offset will take away from MY taxes also, what can I do to lessen or nullify the tax offset?

&amp;#x200B;

2. This student loan was taken out in my wifes name and prior to our marriage. Her credit is already utter shit and we do use and leverage my credit since I have high score and good credit history. What would happen If I just told them that my wife will not be paying back the student loan. Period. Her credit will go even farther down? but we dont use her credit so that wont hurt us. I know this is very poor thinking Im just throwing curve balls here, I just hate the idea of paying for $10k student loans for my wife that she took out before we ever even met.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Wife is being hit with a taxoff set because of a student loans she took out in her name prior to us ever being married. Since we file married jointly what can I do to protect OUR/MY tax return. I was reading and was told I could file some  injured spouse claim form  IRS Form 8379 to protect my own taxes but Im still trying to find some hard evidence of that",finance
personalfinance,Hospital Bill Options,"Hi All. I'm struggling with what I should do to take care of a hospital. I feel like I've exhausted all of my ""fair"" options and am now left with choosing between two paths that both lead to even more financial instability.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the E.R. last year. I was told by a P.A. at my doctors office that I needed to leave the office and head over to the hospital for an ultrasound and some blood work and that I just needed to go through the E.R. Fast forward to today and I have a $2,700 bill that my doctor agrees wasn't worth the visit. I have attempted a few different things to try and get this taken care of and all have failed. Here is what I've done.

\- Offered to pay hospital a lower amount in full to have my account closed

(hospital said they don't do that)

\- Applied for hardship/financial assistance through the hospital

(was denied. my family of 4 brings home 60k taxable income and was told this is too much. we would have to bring in less than 30k to qualify. Wouldnt families making that little just qualify for medicaid?)

\- Contacted a health advocate. This person reached out to and tried to get my insurance to cover more of the costs than they did. Obviously this was a fail.

&amp;#x200B;

So the hospital says that I have two options. Both require me to set up an account with an outside company for financing. Option one is interest free but is only for 6 months. So the payments are SUPER high. Option two is a 6 year financing term with crazy high interest.

&amp;#x200B;

My family and I are on a very strict budget. We have about $3,300 in savings. I could just pay off the bill but it would almost entirely wipe out my savings. We've been working really hard to build up to a 6 month safety net. It's taken us a year to get this far. We can't afford to add the super high no interest payment into our monthly budget. And I sure as HELL am not paying on this for 6 years with an insane interest rate. My wife and I both have 800 credit scores and have worked hard to get those.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think my best option would be? We have two credit cards. One doesn't run a montly balance. The other ranges from 0 to 600 on it at any given time. I don't like the idea of opening a third credit card but if I found one with like 18 months interest free should I do it for this bill? Or should I just pay it off. Please help.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Don't get me started on the RIDICULOUS sate of healthcare costs and insurance scams going on here in the states right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I sincerely appreciate any help or advice.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\* 

I just spoke with my bank just to see what options they might have. There are two. One is a home equity line of credit. We would have to open a line of $15,000. I'm not completely y in love with this idea but it's the lowest interest option out there.

The other is a type of account that they add to my checking. It acts like a revolving door of credit if I ever needed. It for $10k at an interest rate of about 8%. She didn't tell me home equity line of credit percentage but did say it was lower than 8%. Thoughts?\*\*\*

Let's say the higher balance with lower interest rate is costing you $80 /mth in interest vs $40 /mth for the lower balance with higher interest rate.

In my mind, since at the end of the day what matters most is how much you got left in your pocket, wouldn't it make better financial sense to pay down the one costing you $80 vs the one costing you $40, regardless of the rate?  Then once you get that $80 down inline with the other one then you switch to putting more towards the higher rate?

The guy we had been workin with wasn’t there so I decided not to sign it until we talked to him. 

We went in the next day and talked and he made it sound like a misunderstanding and he was going to try to push the loan through anyway at the lower rate which is what we wanted. Come today (over a week later)  and he calls again and said he could not get it to go through but he was going to adjust the deal so we were paying per month what we originally were so I go in and again he isn’t there. I look at the papers and the interest is at the higher rate but the monthly amount is less (about in the middle from our original and second monthly payment amounts). 

My question is this. Can I back out of this deal still?

   * First one: $1k down
   * Second one: Provide documentation that loan on vehicle 1 would be paid off
      * Contacted GAP company.  They provided me with a ""Letter of intent to pay"".  Which basically stated that I had GAP coverage and they were working through the claim.
* Car dealer accepted the documentation. 
* I showed up.  Provided a paper copy of the letter of intent, $1k down, completed paperwork and left.
* Little more than a week later, car dealer contacts me and says the new bank didn't accept the letter of intent to pay from GAP.  They wanted a document from Bank 1 stating the loan was paid in full.
* This wasn't possible as the insurance claim and GAP claim were still in process.
* By the time GAP and Insurance completed everything and I gave the car dealer the letter, my loan approval had expired.  (This is the key part)
* So, they had to resubmit.  Well, of course after the credit inquiries my score had dipped.  My NEW payment is $40 per month higher.  Interest rate is 4 points higher.

2 things you need to know.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  I work for a commercial truck dealer.  We fire sales people that work deals this stupidly.  As a matter of fact, one was just shown the door last week.  How stupid can you be to let a car walk off your lot and not be funded?  I have the title, all the paperwork with their signatures.
2. I want to fight.  Barring a lawyer telling me I'm screwed, I'm going to hammer the F&amp;I guy regardless.  He deserves it.

So, here's my question(s): What am I looking at here? Where is my leverage?  Where is the car dealer's leverage?  Should I lawyer up NOW? Because once I say ""lawyer"" at any point in the conversation... the dealing stops and I'll get passed to their legal department.  I'd rather duke it out with the F&amp;I guy and make him own his mistake. (As I would.  I'd be either fired or signing documents agreeing to make payments to my company.  And MY dealers are much much bigger than this and it would take me years to cover the loss.)

personalfinance,Advice on best approach to buying a car,"So I'm a medical student that will be starting my rotations soon (don't know which state yet). I will definitely be needing a car, which I don't have yet. I'm okay with buying a good used car but also want it to be reliable cause I'll be really busy during rotations. 

The problem is that all my money is from my student loans. Fortunately, I usually accepted the entire amount of loans for my refund check, so I currently have about $14,000 in my savings account. I can either pay this back and it will go towards my current outstanding debt, or just keep it for future needs (which is what I am doing right now). The interest rate on these loans are about 6%. When I start rotations, I'll get another check from my school for living expenses which I can either accept or deny. 

The total amount of loans that I have is about $183,000 from undergrad + first two years of medical school. I have a credit card that I use for everyday purchases and pay it off with my loan money. My credit score is 720. 

So my question is what is the best thing to do here? 

1) Keep the extra $14,000 that I currently have and buy a good car from carmax or something in full price that will last me for a while and hopefully through residency. The good part is that I'll have a car that I own but bad part is that its from my expensive loans

2) Keep the $14,000 in my account and get a car through carmax, and gradually pay it off with my current money + future checks. Upside I won't have to make a huge payment right off the bat but downside Idk If I'll even qualify for this bc I already have so many loans 

3) Buy the cheapest car I can and not waste so much money. Upside is I'll save money downside it might break down and I have no idea what to do in that case. 

4) Lease a car which is something I have no idea about. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? I could technically use my loan money on the car since its a ""living expense,"" but I'm not really sure if thats the best idea. I would appreciate any help in this manner! thanks!",finance

personalfinance,"[DEBT] Should I consider filing bankruptcy? If not, what should I do? Details inside.","Hey guys, thank you for coming. Let's dive in, here's my situation..

I live in Oklahoma, I'm 25 years of age, and I work at a gas stattion as a Shift Leader making $11.70 an hour at 40 hours a week. Currently, I am staying at a family friends house, I have no assets (vehicle or house), a suspended driver license, and a garnishment that is taking 25% of my income. Since I turned a 18, I never took finances that serious, and I'd always brush debt off like it wasn't important. Now that I'm older, I'm trying to be more responsible for my past mistakes and pay off my debt. Here's a brief rundown of my debt.

&amp;#x200B;

I was arrested on July 4th 2017 for a suspended license in Logan County. I had multiple traffic warrants (since then have paid most of them off). Also, on December of 2017, 25% of my income started to get garnished from my check at Love's (over what I believe is an unpaid car loan, but it's possible to be from something else). The total amount I owe for the garnishment is $9,311.18, and I've paid a total of $3,369.88 the garnishment debt since December 2017. Including the amount taken out for Federal and State taxes, I'm left with about half my check each week. For example, last week I made $470.47 before taxes, garnishment, and health insurance costs. After it is all taken, I'm left with $249.27. I still have one more traffic ticket left to pay for in order to start the process with the DMV to get my license unsuspended. I also have other unpaid debt like, 1 credit card, hospital bills, government student aid, etc. These debts have all been sent to collection agencies, and I don't know the accurate amount of these debts. I would love some helpful insight on some possible options I might have in order to help get my life back on track. Currently the way things are going, It'll take me years and years to pay off all my debt, and to be able to live on my own income again. Would a chapter 7 bankruptcy be a possible solution for a 25 year old single male buried in debt? Would filing bankruptcy discharge my dept for the garnishment? Is there any way to reduce the 25% of income from garnishment?

Thank you in advance, and I apologize for my grammar.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I was only able to get a credit report from TransUnion. Here is what I got.

Automobile Loan Balance - $3124

Credit Card Balance - $741

Apartment Balance (I had to break my lease) - $2077

Medical Bills Balance - $9571

Now, I'm kinda confused on what my garnishment is for. Maybe the car loan balance isn't including interest and the letter I received is? It does say I have been making payments on the car loan the last year. Jesus thats alot of debt. :(

Prudential Guaranteed Interest Account claims to guarantee AT LEAST 3% returns a year for only 0.10% gross fee.

[https://nb.fidelity.com/public/workplacefunds/view-all/OTSM](https://nb.fidelity.com/public/workplacefunds/view-all/OTSM)

Are there any downsides to this? Why would people choose money market funds when there's a guaranteed interest rate account that gives such high interest rate back?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I see on Fidelity their money market funds are FZFXX, SPAXX, and SPRXX. Their 10 year rate is like 0.17% while its gross fees are 0.42%. Why would anyone sane then put their money on these money market funds?

Wouldn't these yield negative savings because the fees are higher than the rates? Am I missing something fundamental because I cannot understand why people put money in money market funds when their yields look negative while there's something like a ""Guaranteed Interest Account"" which gives AT LEAST 3% a year and only has a 0.1% gross fee.

I started my job last month and have been putting most of my earnings in a savings account for a “down payment” on my student loans to decrease the principal and possibly lower interest rates.

I shopped for other insurance quotes but this was the cheapest I could find.

So, we are highly considering it.

Below is what we have taken into consideration from a financial perspective.  What did we miss?

* Taxes - Setting aside 33% for federal and state.
* Retirement - Setting aside 10% (We are in our mid 30's.  I'd like to get this to 15% or 20%)
* Medical - Adding wife to my plan.  It is a better plan anyway.  My wife's school is self insured so here options were limited and they were a pain to deal with.  Additional cost factored into decision.
* Child care - No more before and after school care due to the added flexibility of the new position.  However, we will now have child care expenses in the summer.  So, it's a wash.
* Training for new position - covered by agency.
* Self employed tax deductions - Not factored into decision.  I'm hoping the gains here can be used to increase retirement savings but want to get through a whole tax season to see how deductions shake out.

Retirement

* My wife is currently maxing out a Roth IRA.  The 10% budget for retirement leaves money leftover for another type of account.  I understand we can take advantage of a solo 401k, SEP-IRA, or SIMPLE-IRA.  For those 1099 contractors out there, what do you do?

stocks,S&amp;P 500's monthly change in October was at 2009 levels,"Graph of this issue:
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DqyqT0fWkAEiv0S.jpg

October was a rough ride for U.S. stocks, which despite regaining a portion of the month's losses Wednesday ended as one of the worst months since the financial crisis.

The S&amp;P 500 lost $1.91 trillion in October, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt. Losses were spread widely across industry sectors. October was the worst month for the S&amp;P 500 since September 2011.

""October volatility is legendary, and we're not just talking about the crash in 2008,"" Silverblatt told CNBC. ""October is a much more volatile month than any of the others as far as quick declines go.""

The month kicked off on a rocky note for stocks when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is ""a long way"" from neutral interest rates. Powell said the Fed does not need the policies put in place that pulled the economy out of the last financial crisis. He declared that ""we don't need"" the ""really extremely accommodative low interest rates"" the central bank put in place a decade ago. The Fed is likely to raise the federal funds rate to 3.4 percent before pausing, according to the most recent projections.

Big technology stocks — most well-known as FANG: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet — were among the hardest hit. Amazon ended the month down 20.2 percent, and Netflix ended down 19.3 percent. Investors fled both after earnings reports. Facebook and Alphabet finished October down 7.7 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively.

She was married for over 10 years and did live there for over 5 years which seem to be mandatory to claim it at all but just cant seem to find anywhere the information about in what circumstance it can be paid abroad to a country without some arrangement. 

We have wrote back but it has been a little while and are keen to find out. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask these question but am just unsure where are to turn.

As a result, I have great credit, and a total credit limit somewhere in the ~$50k range on my credit card. I only ever use like $1k max every month and pay it in full.

But for the last few months, I've been doing home renovations, and I paid everything out of my savings (didn't touch any investment accounts). I'm down to my last $10k, from about $40k. That 10k is my emergency fund. 

I considered taking out a HELOC, but I kept the mentality that I'm borrowing against myself, so I can just pay myself back later without any interest.

Now I feel a bit financially tight, as my credit card bill for this month is about $4.5k due to a million trips to Lowe's and Home Depot. It's been that way for the last few months, but I had my savings to help cover the difference, so I had continued paying in full every month.

Do you think it's better to keep a balance this month on my credit card so I don't dip further into my savings, and pay this bill off over the course of 2 months, instead of in full?

For reference, assume I have $2k in income after all my other obligations are met, excluding credit cards. Usually, this is the amount I split between putting in savings and paying credit card every month.

Like the title states, I am 23 years old, in college and have about 12k in credit card debt.

I’m not bad with money, i’m frugal by all means. I don’t spend money on flashy items, I wear old clothes and about once a year, I buy new T shirts that are $8.99 and will last me for years. I live a pretty simplistic lifestyle. I wear one pair of shoes until they fall off my feet or begin to smell. 

I’ve reduced eating out (which was a killer of mine) a few months ago and really haven’t spent money since my semester has started. I don’t go out to bars often nor do I vacation a lot. I had a hobby that was costing me a pretty penny so I stopped indulging so often as it was becoming a bad habit rather than a hobby.

I’m a business student, management/marketing major so i’m very keen to the aspects of money and dealing with money so on and so forth. 

I have two semesters (end of next December) until I am finished with school. 

Finances:

I currently have a job as a valet making about $140 a week but I haven’t been working since the semester started because my availability is so limited so my boss doesn’t allot me any shifts.

I have about $500/month in other income and recently got food stamps so that should cover my monthly food.

My dad pays for my gas and other utilities along with my rent. So he covers the basic necessities for me to live but doesn’t give me disposable money.

I usually pay around $700-$1,000 a month total off my CC but between my gas, interest, and other things i’m only really paying a few hundred off of the principle.

I have a loan taken out in my name for my mom on a couch that she pays monthly, also a school loan out for $5,500 subsidized that my dad is going to pay off in one lump sum payment we just haven’t gotten around to it.

I also have 5 credit cards in my name but the balance is accrued on 2 CC. 

My question for you Redditors.

What is my best option on paying this off long term? Do I continue to do what I am doing or is it in my best interest to apply for a loan to pay off my CC debt with lower interest rates? Will I even apply for a loan?

investing,Rising interest rates are a catch 22 for stocks,"As the fed continues its steady rise of interest rate hikes, US treasuries have are becoming a more attractive alternative to other investments. Real estate, stocks, and other long dated bond prices are all negatively affected as interest rates rise. As treasuries are considered to be one of the safest investments, someone looking to simply keep up with inflation now has a choice to invest in short date treasuries rather than deal with the risk of stocks or longer dated bonds. This sort of equation is happening across the spectrum of high and low risk investments. 

The fed rate has risen from 0-0.25% to 2-2.25%. Mortgage rates have risen from there low of 3.5% to over 5%. Long dated treasury ETFs like $VUSUX have fallen 20% from their 2015 highs. Corporate bonds have fared a little better but are not far behind. Real estate prices and stock ETFs like $VT have not yet suffered, but are at risk as interest rates continue to rise.

Unfortunately for asset prices, the federal reserve will continue to raise interest rates as long as economic indicators like growth and unemployment rates continue to be strong. This creates a damned if you do damned if you don't situation for stocks. Either economic data takes a turn and stocks asset prices suffer or economic data stays strong, the fed raises interest rates and asset prices suffer. When stock prices take a turn is anyone's guess, but luckily you can be paid to wait by investing in short dated bonds.",finance

personalfinance,"I've paid off my car, but is it cost-effective to keep it?","Last year I got a 2014 Mazda6 for $20k, and thanks to a low interest rate and my reenlistment bonus I was able to pay off the loan in just over a year versus the original 5-year period. Lately, I've been considering downgrading to a cheaper vehicle in order to save money within my budget and in long term savings (I've already given attention to most of my other expenditures and my car is one of the last things for me to think about), but after all the research I've done I still don't know whether it would be more cost-beneficial to keep my current car or sell it.

Here are the variables I've been working with:

* Current Car
   * Purchased for $20k, current KBB value $16k
   * Cost of insurance: $177/month
   * Cost of gas: \~$100/month
   * Although my car has no history of mechanical or electrical problems, the 2014 model year is known for having more issues than its' following years.
* Getting an less expensive car would most likely demand I spend more on gas each month, however an older car would be cheaper to insure, so for the sake of simplicity the cost of gas and insurance together would be roughly the same.
* I bought this car with the intention of keeping it for a very long time. I would like to do the same with a cheaper vehicle but I am well aware that, generally speaking, older cars are more prone to issues than newer ones and I would likely need to pay for repairs closer the value of the car sooner than I would with my current one.
* I know all cars depreciate, but I also know older cars have already depreciated most of what they will over their lifetime, whereas my car still has a long way to go. That being said I don't even know if I should consider depreciation as a factor at all, since my goal is to drive whatever car I have until it becomes impractical to do so.
* I know that buying a different car now would essentially cost its' price + $4k from the lost value in my current car. If I sold now for $16k and bought another car for at most $12k (realistically thinking between $6k-$10k) I don't know if that would actually be more cost-beneficial to me in the short or long-term.

personalfinance,Credit Union has been double-deducting my Auto Loan for last 8 Months,"&gt; TL;DR: My credit union has been deducting the monthly loan repayment from each bi-weekly paycheck instead of splitting it. What are my options for getting this fixed, and possibly getting a refund or asking them to move the next payment due date out a few months. What would be good/bad for my credit?  


So, to get this out there up front... I don't pay much attention to my bank account. For over 15 years I lived paycheck to paycheck, and it caused me massive problems with anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, to the point where I turned into a shut-in, and even with medication still struggle today.    


Once I got to a particular point in my salary, it was like a switch was flipped, and where before I never had money... now I always had money.  I set every monthly payment/expense up for automated payments, and I knew as long as I spent less than a specific amount a month, I'd always be saving a good chuck of change every month.  


This takes me back to March of this year. I decided to trade in my old Motorcycle for a new one. I had the old one basically paid off, and the new one would only cost \~$150 extra per month. I went through my credit union at work, where they do automatic payroll deduction, and I just mentally said ""hey /r/LongLiveCHIEF, your monthly fun budget is now $150 less a month than it was"".    


Wasn't really a problem, because I'm a single and boring dude that only spends money on delivery food, and I never really went over that monthly fun budget.  


Fast-Forward to last month. I went to buy my usual Friday evening treat for myself, a stuffed deep dish pizza from a true italian place, and my debit card was declined.  Ok, I used my credit card, and continued on with life.  


Over the last month, I had to rely almost exclusively on my credit card, because I found that I didn't have enough money to cover even my monthly expenses from my checking.   


Today I sat down and painstakingly went through accounting for every cent of my monthly budget, figuring I missed something.  After all the monthly expenses were added up, i had exactly `0.38` cents left over for food and gas in my monthly budget.  


Then I realized that I was subtracting the appx $300 for my motorcycle payment when it was already included in the _income_ number of my bi-weekly paycheck that I was using to subtract my expenses from. This was better, but I knew I should have way more than that, because that didn't even cover my food budget each month.  


Finally, after taking a look at my paystubs, I realized that the monthly amount for my motorcycle loan wasn't being split equally for each paycheck, it was actually being deducted in full from _every_ paycheck.  


The website doesn't let me view the original loan agreement, but doing the math with the APR has verified that at 60 months, my loan would only be half of what I'm paying each month.   


At this point, I'm going to call them first thing Monday, but I'm wondering what my goal should be here. Obviously, I want them to stop deducting the full monthly amount from each paycheck.  The loan balance at this point though is correct based on what I've paid, so I'm wondering if it's going to be possible to get a ""refund"" of sorts and my loan re-adjusted.  


I overpay on my car loan every month, and I know that I can miss payments for several months and not be considered late (my amount due every month when I check the site always says `0.00`).  


Should I ask for them to adjust my next payment due date out several months to account for the extra payments? Should I ask them to refinance based on the new balance to make up for the double payments?    


I could really use the money from the over-payment to get my credit utilization back under control after the last month or so jacked it up.  


What would the credit union be likely to do, and what are my options, and what would be good/bad for my credit?  


I want to be as informed as possible when I have a discussion with them on Monday.

personalfinance,Car payment inquiry,"Hello, so before I disappoint many of you, I have to preface this by saying I know I should have been better but I wouldnt be posting here if I was,

I am currently 24 with a Government job with a monthly income of $2700 after taxes

This is my FIRST JOB. It’s important to say because this is also a journey of building credit. After High School i went directly to a state college and got an AA degree with a $5000 student loan. 

The next part is the issue and like I said, I should have been better. My father is disabled and my mother works but they are terrible with money. They both have no credit but they have done a decent job at building it back. So I allowed my father to help me with getting a car because I truly had no financial understanding of the real world.

I myself, essentially had no credit. Literally nothing. So I went and purchased a Mustang with 20% interest. Yes. 20%. Hello, I’m very stupid. My month car payment was 498. 

6 months later in November of 2017, I took my mustang to a Honda dealership and got the very basic of packages for a 2017 Honda Civic. Less money spend on gas and my money payment went down to 448 with an interest rate of 1.9%.

I just passed a year with the Honda. I live with my girlfriend and pay her rent. I have a credit card that just had it’s limit bumped to $1,500. The electric for the house is in my name. Essentially i’ve gotten my credit up to the 730’s consistently (checked with Wells Fargo app FICO score). 

I’ve tried to give any information that I think is relevant. Can I do anything to get my monthly payments lowered or am I stuck with a bad decision for the next 61 payments 🤢",finance
personalfinance,Want to purchase a new TV with personal loan,"Hi Everyone,

So my boyfriend and I are looking at a new TV for our Christmas gift to each other. The TV cost with tax comes to $2200. While we could pay for this in cash now, we don't want to dip into any savings for it. He can get a technology loan from his bank at a 3% interest rate over 60 months. this would cost us about $200 extra but would allow us to not really think about the payments.

What I want to know is how does a personal technology loan work? Is it just cash that appears in his checking account after it is approved? Ideally we want to purchase the TV on my sky miles card to get the points, then use the personal loan to pay off that balance and have a lower interest rate than the card would.

Is this feasible?",finance
personalfinance,Dispute or GW Letter?,"Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have two 30-day late payments on my Capital One Credit Cards (one on each card) from Nov 2017. Before I left on military orders on September of 2017 for training, I called them and told them I was being deployed and wanted to try and pay the annual fee a few months in advance, so I wouldn’t have any late payments, since I wouldn’t have any contact with the outside world for literally 9 whole months. They said they don’t charge military members the annual fee and they would waive it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

After getting back May of 2018, I pulled my credit report and saw I had one missed payment reported on each card and I’m still kinda confused to this day why. I thought it was probably just a mistake and I was accidentally charged the annual fees. So I called Capital One, and they said it was due to some pending charges.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember checking before I left and leaving with no balance though. Some of the charges don’t seem too familiar to me that were on there. Especially one place that I don’t think I’ve ever even been too! My memory isn't that great, and I honestly can't even remember where I used my card at during that time last year. One or two of the places there was a charge from just sounds so strange, I can't remember ever going there, but maybe I did and I just don't remember since the other charges would be places that I'd go to. Even to this day though, after being with Capital One for many years, I’ve never missed a payment besides this one month last year. That's the only time it's ever happened!

&amp;#x200B;

After calling Capital One several times again, they said if I want to try and dispute against it, I could mail in a credit dispute with the description of the situation and how I’d like it resolved. I was going to mail in this letter (see below) along with my military orders, and the credit reports of the dates the late payments were reported. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping to get this removed because I was trying to shop around for a better interest rate. And I thought this issue was just because of a mistake from being charged the annual fees. But it looks like it isn't just that now. At first I was typing up a dispute, but then I included in some things you might write in a GW letter.

I don't have any support really let alone anyone decent with money that I can ask for help/guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My debts are as follows, I hope you're ready to cry. Yes, I realize it's very bad. If you want to ridicule me to make yourself feel better, feel free. I already know this.

&amp;#x200B;

CC #1 $17,180 with 4% interest rate

CC #2 $14,000 with 4% interest rate

CC#3 $7,000 with 19.99% interest rate

CC#4 $17,000 with variable interest rate (AmEx platinum honestly I couldn't find out where the % was)

Private Loan #1 $14,663.74 @ 2.99%

School Loan #1 $11,317.21 @ 5.750%

School Loan #2 $13,028.07 @ 5.50%

School Loan #3 $15,017.58 @ 4.75%

School Loan #4 $17,800.14 @ 4.75%

&amp;#x200B;

Which is roughly $127,000 in debt. A staggering amount I understand, but nothing in life is impossible. I'm just fortunate to **literally** be alive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $3500 in cash right now to my name, that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

 My expenses per month are as follows:

Rent: $1050

Car Lease: $465 (stuck with it for another \~2 years, no option to transfer lease holder with this lender)

Car Insurance: $187

Internet: $60 (I don't have cable tv or any internet televison service)

Utilities: Roughly $100 between gas/electric, I don't pay for water.

Car Gas: Depends but anywhere from $60-130

Groceries: $100-220

= $2112/average

Now my minimum payments for all my debts are as follows:

CC#1 $220

CC#2 $190

CC#3 $195

CC#4 $\~1100

Private Loan #1 $360

School Loan #1  $134

School Loan #2 $141

School Loan #3 $94

School Loan #4 $111

= $2545 

Total that's $4657 in just absolute minimum payments. Now my paychecks are $5058/month after taxes. That leaves about $401 for the occasional clothing item, toiletries, hair cuts, razers, and paying down my debt?

&amp;#x200B;

Now here is an additional part that I'm struggling with, I'm eligible for one of two bonuses. I can choose a School Loan repayment that is $40k/yr for 2 yrs (about 25% taxes so $30k/yr really) but I probably won't get it until March/April of 2019 after all the processing/paperwork/etc (I am only eligible to put my application in starting Feb2019). 

**Or**, I can get a CASH bonus of $20k/yr for 2yrs (about $15k after taxes) and I probably would get that one in Dec/Jan or Feb at the very latest. 

After those 2 years I am eligible for more bonuses but who knows what they will be at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that $60k is a lot more money (my entire school loan amount) vs $30k cash. I feel like it's a stupid question but I'm not sure if it makes more sense to take the $15k and put it towards my card with 19.99% interest as well as my Amex with $17k. With my \~$3k in cash I could knock off those two cards and use that money towards my others cards/school. 

&amp;#x200B;

While it's looking quite possible I could be in debt for a very long time, I would qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness in about 8 years if I continued to make those payments.

Can anyone give me their best guidance on a plan of attack?

The current repayment plan for the college loan is 10 years. Like I said, we don't want to pay that much interest, but also want to build credit and maybe invest some money.

What is the best strategy to repay these loans, while paying as little interest as possible while also gaining more credit? I'm thinking we aim to pay these loans off in 2 or 3 years.

Edit: this article is why I'm asking this question: https://blog.credit.com/2013/02/how-does-paying-off-a-loan-affect-your-credit-score-64668/

Edit 2: I would love to not pay interest. But I also want to do what's going to be best for us long term. If paying a little bit of interest now (maybe ~$2k) is going to save us a lot later, I'm willing to do that.

I’m a newlywed, late 20s. About to graduate with a good degree. My wife is also in grad school, and her expected salary is 50-70k per year, but not for another year. She will be able to finish in either location. 

I’m down to two job offers (rejected my others for various reasons)

**Total Student Debt:** 130k (estimated min payments 1250/month) 

**Liquid Cash**: We keep about 5K in emergency funding (6-8 weeks)  and try to keep 2-5K in checking. 

I liquidated all my retirement (to minimize my new student debt/pay for school expenses) 

**Location**
Both cities are similar “lowish” cost of living cities, one near my family, one near her family. Think Nashville, Raleigh, Atlanta, Austin. Could be low or could be high depending on my tolerance for a commute. 


**Job Offer 1:** 90k, 15k signing bonus, 8% target bonus. 6% 401k match, immediate vesting, 5 weeks total PTO. 

**Job 1 Work/Life:** I know I like the team, it’s high visibility, 35-50 hours/week. Work from home 2-3 days a week. Functional and Industry of preference. 

**Job Offer 2:** 120k (might go up to 130), 20k signing bonus, “up to” 25k year end (average online says closer to 15k), No 401k match, 3 weeks total PTO, 

**Job 2 Work/Life:** 50-60 hours/week, don’t know team. Functional Preference, Not industry preference. Will be traveling Monday to Thursday 60-80% of the year. Which also comes with miles and per diems. 

**Negotiating**
So I’m currently asking for Job 1 to match, as their functional roles are very very similar. Almost identical in fact. So much so that I could still go back to Company for Job 1 after a few years at Job 2.  I’m assuming I’ll get bumped from 90 to about 100/105 since Job 1 knows they offer a better work/life balance. But job 2 does have potential to add another 10k

Hers has 2-3 years left. She will do a similar car type, but by then we’d like to pay cash.

We’d like to buy a house (225-300k range depending on the market at the time, well likely qualify for a 400k-500k house, depending on interest rates, but we want to live below our means) in 2-4 years, but are fine renting depending on liquid cash situation. It’s approximately the same liquid cost to rent or buy at both locations, all in including taxes, so the equity in housing is advantageous, we might upgrade houses once or twice, but plan to be in same area for 20 years. 

Vacations are pretty modest, after we did a 2 week euro honeymoon, and lots of academic travel. 

We do plan to splurge on about $500 in theater season tickets with my signing bonuses. 

Again, Kids in 1-3 years. I plan to use half of my bonuses as a fund for them, half for debt.  We have lots of hand me downs from my sister, who has 3. 


So PF, I’m asking for a reality check. I’d  obviously love to have a better work life balance, spend more time with my new wife. But the miles, the ~40K more per year seems pretty damn tempting. But, once we’re a two Income household, it’ll be even easier, and you’re only young married and without kids once! 

**TLDR;** I have two great job offers, high debt, and a few years before kids with wife. Do I choose work life balance for less money, or set self up for future. 

P.S. I’m aware this is a first world problem and I’m very blessed, even with 130k in student debt.",finance
personalfinance,Do I take the pension or is it too risky?,"I recently got a job working for the state of Massachusetts' transportation system.  Technically I do not work for the state as we are ""quasi"" state employees.  I am now part of a union which negotiates on behalf of us with the state.  In this union I have the option of a 401k with 8% match or a pension in which you must complete 25 years of service and be at least 55 years old in which I can get 72% of my highest three years earning in perpetuity.

As I am only 27 years old I would have to do 28 years to receive this pension, whereas if I started working at 45 and retired at 55 I would have 10 years and get something like 25% in perpetuity.  If I leave before the 25 years I get nothing, just my contributions back (8.08%) plus 3% interest.

Most people I talk to think I am insane if I do not take the pension (Which I am leaning heavily toward doing) but there's something about essentially being handcuffed to one company for 25 years that bothers me.  Also another big concern for me is if the pension will still exist in 25 years, or am I going to get screwed in the end?  It's basically set up like social security so no guarantees.

Am I dumb for not taking the pension?  Or is it too risky?  Please advise!",finance
stocks,"Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for the week beginning November 12th, 2018","Hello traders of the r/stocks sub and happy Sunday to all! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 12th, 2018.

# **Dow drops 200 points on worries about slowing global economic growth** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/09/stock-market-us-futures-lower-after-fed-decision.html)*
*****
&gt; Stocks fell on Friday as further losses in oil prices sparked fears of a global economic slowdown, but the major indexes still managed solid weekly gains.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 201.92 points to 25,989.30 as losses in Caterpillar and Goldman Sachs offset gains from Disney. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.9 percent to 2,781.01, led lower by consumer discretionary shares and tech. The Nasdaq Compositelagged, dropping 1.7 percent to 7,406.90 as shares of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet all traded lower.
*****
&gt; The indexes recovered most of their losses late in the day. At its session lows, the Dow was down 308.31 points.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate futures fell 0.8 percent to $60.19 a barrel, after briefly breaking below $60 for the first time since March. They also fell further into bear-market territory, trading more than 20 percent below their 52-week high.
*****
&gt; Disappointing data out of China also dampened sentiment on Wall Street. The country's top auto industry association said sales in China fell 11.7 percent last month, marking the fourth straight monthly decline. The Shanghai Composite fell 1.4 percent overnight. Caterpillar shares dropped 3.4 percent in the U.S. while General Motors' stock fell 2.4 percent.
*****
&gt; ""The overall trend is definitely weakening,"" said Benjamin Lau, chief investment officer of Apriem Advisors. ""You're seeing it in some of the earnings.""
*****
&gt; ""We're seeing more anecdotal evidence that the global economy is weakening from the bottom end to the top end,"" Lau said.
*****
&gt; The weak Chinese economic data come as the U.S. and China engage in a trade spat that has been going on for most of the year. The two countries have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods as the U.S. seeks a better trade deal with China.
*****
&gt; Comments from White House trade advisor Peter Navarro soured optimism about a possible deal between the two countries. ""If there is a deal — if and when there is a deal, it will be on President Donald J. Trump's terms. Not Wall Street's terms,"" he said. Navarro's comments come ahead of a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming G-20 summit.
*****
&gt; These sharp losses have rekindled worries about a possible slowdown in the global economy, which come as the Federal Reserve looks to further tighten monetary policy. The Fed on Thursday decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged, as was expected, but comments by the U.S. central bank suggested it was on course to continue hiking rates.
*****
&gt; Although a statement released by the institution noted a moderation in business investment, it said the bank still expects ""further gradual increases"" in the prime lending rate. Traders had been on edge last month due to concerns over the Fed's rate hiking path.
*****
&gt; But equities still recorded strong gains for the week, following a big post-midterm elections rally. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow gained 2.8 percent and 2.1 percent for the week, respectively. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, rose 0.7 percent. This week's gains were the biggest for the Dow since the week of March 9, when it rose 3.25 percent.
*****
&gt; The U.S. midterm elections ended with the Democrats taking control of the House and the GOP maintaining a majority in the Senate. This result was widely expected by pollsters and election experts. Under this government make-up, meaning a split Congress and a Republican president, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a 12 percent gain since 1928, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
*****
&gt; ""We've got this 'yes, but' scenario, meaning things are good right now but a lot can still happen,"" said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management. ""There's still some turmoil and some volatility keeping investors on the sidelines.""
*****
&gt; On the earnings front, Yelp shares plunged more than 26 percent after releasing its latest quarterly results. Dow-member Disney, meanwhile, rose 1.7 percent on the back of better-than-expected results.

# Typical November Trading: Strength Early &amp; Late

&gt; As of the market’s close yesterday, DJIA was up 2.07% thus far in November. S&amp;P 500 was higher by 1.61% and NASDAQ was higher by 0.96%. Small-caps, measured by the Russell 2000 were performing the best, up 2.96% over the first four trading days in November. Current gains are consistent with the historical trend of early November strength. However, historically early strength has faded after the fourth trading day. Election results coming in line with expectations has extended strength this year. Mid-month, from around the fifth trading day until the fourteenth trading day, has been choppy. From there until the penultimate trading day of November the market has historically booked solid gains. Recently the last trading day has been prone to more weakness than strength.

# Beyond the Midterm Elections…A Solid Rally Regardless

&gt; Later today the first of the day’s election results will begin to trickle in and if history is any guide, the results will likely have a minor impact on the market. This is the “Sweet Spot” of the four-year cycle for the market. In the following chart the 30 trading days before and 60 days trading days after the last 17 midterm year elections appear (NASDAQ since 1974). Prior to 1969 the market was closed on Election Day so the close on the day before was used. By 60 trading days after the election (approximately three months), DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ were all higher on average from 6.8% to nearly 10%.

&gt; Digging deeper into the data, the following table shows S&amp;P 500 performance 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months after the midterm elections since 1950. 1- and 3-months after the election S&amp;P 500 was higher 82.4% and 94.1% of the time respectively. By 6-months and 1-year after, S&amp;P 500 was always higher, although gains did slow after 6-months. The years the President’s party lost control of the House of Representatives are shaded in grey.

# 5 Midterm Charts to Know

&gt; Chart 1 – Most equity gains tend to happen late in the year during a midterm year.

&gt; Chart 2 – Since 1946, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been higher 12 months after every single midterm election. That’s 18 for 18.

&gt; Chart 3 – The S&amp;P 500’s closing low for the month of October was October 29. Since 1950 in mid-term election years, the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 10% on average from the October low close until the end of the year.

&gt; Chart 4 – Under a Republican president, the best scenario for stocks has been a split Congress. This is the most likely scenario after today’s elections, according to most Washington insiders.

&gt; Chart 5 – The fourth quarter of a midterm year historically have been the best quarter of the four-year presidential cycle. Not to be outdone, the next two quarters have been quite strong as well.

# S&amp;P 500 Cumulative A/D Line Tracking Price

&gt; We monitor all sorts of different breadth indicators in order to get a feel for how market internals compare to moves in the major market averages, and one of the most widely followed of these indicators is the S&amp;P 500’s cumulative A/D line. The cumulative A/D line is simply a running total of the daily net number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 rising or falling.

&gt; The chart below shows the cumulative A/D line for the S&amp;P 500 (red line) and the index’s price over the last 12 months. At first glance, it looks like the cumulative A/D line has generally been tracking the price of the index during this period, but if you look closely, there are some key periods that are telling. Looking back at the late January through early Spring period, you can see that while equities sold off sharply in the initial leg lower, breadth held up relatively well. In fact, while the first bounce in February stalled out well short of the prior highs, the cumulative A/D line came close to making a new high. More importantly, though, when the S&amp;P 500 tested the February lows, the cumulative A/D line didn’t come close to making a new low, and then the rally that followed, it actually made a new high well before the market. This was a key positive divergence at the time and suggested that the S&amp;P 500 would eventually retake its prior highs.

&gt; In the current period leading up to the S&amp;P 500’s peak right up until now, we haven’t seen much in the way of divergences in either direction. Both the price and cumulative A/D line of the S&amp;P 500 made new highs on the same day in September, sold off hard, and then in the ensuing rally retraced right around 60% of the high to low decline. Unfortunately, at this point breadth isn’t saying much good or bad. Looking forward, though, the key things to watch will be how breadth reacts if Friday’s decline is the beginning of a new leg lower, or what happens if the S&amp;P 500 rebounds and makes a run for new highs.

&gt; If you are a bull, you’ll want to see breadth remain above the recent low on any retest of the lows in price or a new high in breadth ahead of a new high in price. Bears, on the other hand, will want to see breadth accelerate to the downside on any weakness and lag prices on any upside.

I’m a bit unclear as to what the equivalent deal would be after the last few years of interest rate hikes... could anyone explain how that works?

Also, if anyone can suggest a place with solid rates, I’d appreciate it!

personalfinance,Recent grad balancing financial next steps?,"Hey everyone! Just a recent college grad ( Dec 17) with an interest in personal finance but much to learn (and no money to manage up until recently). 

The scenario: 

My annual salary before tax is 65k/year. I have 5.8k debt from the Fed (interest rate 4%) and 7k to my parents (no interest and will take my time paying this back). I have 3.5k saved, 2k in my Roth, and 2k in my 401k. I’ve been paying down my student loan debt pretty aggressively (down from 11k earlier this year). 

My goal is to have 5k in savings by December this year and 5k in fed loans by December. My next move is to eliminate the loans by June, then start focusing on my emergency savings fund (10-12k) and put about half of that into 1yr bonds. 

1. Am I right to be paying down my debt to the Federal government, even if it means not maxing my Roth? 

2. If you were me, would you be doing anything differently? 

3. Last, what would your 3-year goals be if you were in my shoes today?

What can I expect if I do this? Ideas on other options? I don't think I have much collateral to put up on a high interest rate person loan.

personalfinance,My dad maxed out my credit card and now my wages are being garnished,"So nearly a decade ago I let my dad use my credit card while he was unemployed to take care of some necessities, with the promise that it would get paid off once he found a job. His financial situation ended up being bad for a lot longer than either of us thought though. The credit card went to collections, got bought by some debt collection agency, and they sued me about a year before the statute of limitations on the debt was up.

When I found out I was being sued I immediately hired a lawyer. He wrote a response letter and told me he was going to set up negotiations with them to try and make a deal, but he never did, and when they filed a motion for summary judgement he said that wasn't covered by what I paid him, and asked for more money I didn't have. The judge ended up granting them their motion for summary judgement. I never received a letter saying exactly how much I owed them, but I know when I was originally sued they were requesting all the debt from the credit card which would've been 2500, interest for all of the years I wasn't paying on it, interest going forward, and legal fees. 

They also had my wages garnished, which went on for 20 months. It was a giant hassle, but my dad would pay me back the garnishment every payday once I knew how much it was going to be (my hours vary a lot). Last July they finally stopped garnishing me, and I figured I'd finally paid everything off. Until 2 weeks ago when they suddenly started garnishing my wages again. I obtained a new writ of garnishment claiming I still owed them about $2400, and by now I calculate I've already paid them somewhere in the neighborhood of $5000. And its still accumulating interest.

Worst of all my dad's been out of work for about a year and only just recently got a job, and he's really in no financial state to help me out. I have a couple of credit cards that are nearly maxed out because of school and car stuff, and I don't think I'm going to be able to keep up with the interest payments now that I'm having 25% of my wages taken away every check. I'm about to have my second paycheck garnished, and I have no idea how to keep up with this. 

My lease is up at the end of November and I thought maybe I would move back in with my parents for a few months to keep costs low, but I don't think that will be enough, and its honestly not a good living situation. I'm looking for another job, but in my field (security) most better jobs require me to go through some training I have to pay for, and require me to buy a firearm for several hundred dollars. I'm considering getting a personal loan to consolidate some of my credit cards, lower the interest rate, and purchase a gun, but I'm not sure if that's a good idea and I don't know if I could even get one with my credit score currently around 550. What are my options?

personalfinance,Questions about Student Loans,"Hi everyone,

So I’m currently a sophomore in college at a state university. I have a decent number of scholarships covering most of my tuition, but there’s potential for that change in the next few semesters and I had a few questions I was hoping for advice on. I’m on mobile so apologies for formatting issues, I’ll try to break up the wall of text with paragraphs. 

My tuition is currently at $7880 per semester because it’s a state school.  I have scholarships covering all but around $1000 of that, which I’m using an unsub. loan to cover. After next semester however, 2 of my scholarships will be discontinued meaning I’ll end up owing an extra 2000 per semester, bringing the total loans up to 6k a year. 

Over the two years I’ll have left, that amounts to 12k which isn’t a ton for student loans, but I’m also sitting on around 3k in credit cards and 2k on my car. 

So here’s the issue I have. After filling out FAFSA, I qualify for a $5000 per year in Fed Direct unsubsidized loans, which covers my tuition currently but wouldn’t be enough after this semester. FAFSA used my 2016 tax returns this year when I was still a dependent of my father, who made around 250k that year post-tax, however I’ve been independent from him financially since my 18th birthday, and currently live paycheck to paycheck. 

I have no way to save the extra $1000 to cover what the loan doesn’t cover, so I was wondering if there’s anything that can affect the amount that the FAFSA will cover due to me not being supported by my parents? 

My yearly income is around $12500, and I currently split my apartment with my girlfriend to save on housing. 

Because of that huge discrepancy in what the government thinks I have access to ($250k), vs what I actually have access to, can I get a larger loan amount of even perhaps a subsidized version or grant because of how much I actually make?

Taking time off school to save isn’t an option either as I’ll lose the other 10k a year scholarship that i still have if I take a semester off. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Just a confused student trying to plan financially for the future.",finance
personalfinance,Help deciding how to refinance $225k in student loan debt,"Hi everybody,

I graduated from pharmacy school in 2013 with over $200k in debt. For a while I was working as a retail pharmacist and was able to make my interest payments without issue. I recently switched careers (financial details below), but no longer make what I used to. Compounded on that is that my loan payments were on a repayment plan such that the monthly payments start low and increase over time.

I am in the process of refinancing now and am struggling to decide which refinance offer to take. Here are some details:

* Current outstanding balance: $225k
* Current monthly payments: ~$2,650
** Interest rates range from 6% to 10%
** Durations to payoff range from 6 more year (2024) to 10 years (2028)
* Current post-tax monthly income: ~$5,000 / month
* Current savings: ~$10k

I have these offers from SoFi (I got offers from 3 companies, but SoFi had the best rates):

* 10 year, 5.1%, monthly payment = $2,414
* 15 year, 5.2%, monthly payment = $1,815

*Each of these offer a 0.25% rate discount, but the monthly payment stays what it is. I would just pay it off in slightly under 10 or 15 years*

*Part of the reason I'm in this situation is due to my/my parents financial illiteracy 10 years ago. I unfortunately can't ask for a co-signer which is why I'm getting the rates that I am*

Right now, my plan is to:

* Accept the 15 year, 5.2% offer
* Pay $2,100 / month (not $1,815) which reduces the payoff time to 12 years
* Contribute 5% to my employer 401k match

Bitcoin,What makes you confident that bitcoin will be the longterm stable project in the crypto world,"“If you don’t believe it or don’t get it, I don’t have the time to try to convince you.” - Satoshi Nakamoto

&amp;#x200B;

We all know that quote i guess. I'm a very old Bitcoin supporter so im not writing this to be convinced but rather to have some discussion about the current state of the Bitcoin Core project.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just thinking to myself; after following all the btc subreddit drama; nothing is perfect. Also Bitcoin has some things that can be improved and nobody yet knows what the implementations might be that will be necessary to make Bitcoin a future proof experiment!

&amp;#x200B;

The avarage user doesnt understand lightning network yet and its going to take a lot of time to achieve user friendlyness, merchant adoption (without using BitPay for almost anything), scalability and all that good stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin operates a lot on altruism in contrast to things like DASH who have a governance model to support for example merchant adoption and advertisment. I definitely regard this as a good thing because it shows how a lot of people still hold this project in high regard without trying to be instantaneously selfrewarding in the sense of financial gain. (PoS, Masternodes ...) essentially buying people into the chain!

&amp;#x200B;

So i guess my question to all of you on this subreddit is really just your opinion on current state of the Bitcoin project.

&amp;#x200B;

 \- Why do you think Bitcoin will be a stable Project in the future? 

 \- Why do you think it already IS a stable Project for the future? 

 \- Do you think Lightning will master scalibilty? 

 \- Should we increase blocksize at any given time? 

 \- What can we do to increase privacy? 

 \- What BIP do you think should be implemented or was not a good idea to implement?

 \- What do you think of Blockstream?

 \- Is mining decentralized, and how to preserve decentralization?

 \- What did other cryptocurrencies do that could be implemented into Bitcoin?

&amp;#x200B;

..these are some questions that come to my mind...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm happy about every opinion and interesting discussion! Kind of fed up with all the Bcash discussions lately and thought it would be a good idea to start some brainstorming here for pro and cons of the current state of BTC!",cryptocurrency
investing,"Why is the US Dollar growing, and where is it moving?","[The American dollar](https://www.fxpro.co.uk/trading/trade-currency/%23us$indx) **has been showing growth during the last four weeks**, managing to return to the annual highs area. After all, it had closed the Friday session at the highest level in 16 months. Despite the drawdown at the beginning of the week, caused by the traditional pressure on the currency due to pre-election uncertainty, the dollar quickly shake off these fears and has began to rise. Now USD is fully able to continue this trend because of several reasons.

**On the one hand** is the hawkish Fed rhetoric that was demonstrated after the last week meeting. The committee did not reflect on the October stock market’ problems and on the growing signs of the global economy slowdown. This fact had increased the contrast in debt markets’ interest rates due to a growth in dollar short-term interest rates.

**On the other hand**, after the rebound from the end of October, the stock markets of developing countries (especially Asia) had come under pressure again. Moreover, by the end of last week, the positive momentum of growth in US stocks had dried up. And now this trend development is increasing the demand for the dollar as a defensive asset, forming a moderate outflow from other regions.

**Asian indices had lost 2/3 of the rebound** since the end of October, reflecting the return to the markets’ focus the developing countries’ development. The recent lows retesting could become a trigger for a new serious wave of demand for the dollar as a defensive asset. 

At the new week a [number of important data from the United States will be published](https://fxpro.news/economic-calendar/): these are able to support the american currency. Consumer prices and retail sales are expected to show healthy growth, and the subsequent speech by Fed Chairman Powell is expected to shed light on the Fed's position.

In addition to statistical data, traders will **pay attention to the USD behavior near the local maximum**. Growth above the previous peaks at 97 on the Dollar Index is able to open the way to the subsequent rally up to 102 (the multi-year highs since 2017).",finance

My company had signed me up for 401 k with TransAmerica and I was giving contributions through my pay roll.  I have about 4K in It now. Since loosing that job earlier this year I decided to apply for unemployment which I got and do UberEats on the side.  I also went back to school to finish my degree.  

Here’s the thing. TransAmerica has been sending me monthly statements and some other letters I haven’t read.  Basically my contributions has stop. Fast forward to now, I’m looking online I see I can transfer my 401k to a IRA. I’m stupid to this stuff and did some research where I could.  So I got a few questions, sorry if this is burdening to anyone. I just can’t decide after reading so much on here:

Some details 

I’m considering signing up with Capital One 360 for my IRA since I got my checking account with them and fee free. Open to suggestions though. I’m projecting my total income this year will be 27-35k now since job lost.  Next year I’m planning to work for a friend, help him build his business, might move to Florida to do so, this would lead to increased income yearly, but nothing is for sure.  I’m 29. NYC. No savings. 

1. Which should I choose? Roth IRA or traditional? 
2. I’m low on funds since returning to school and was considering taking out 1K to buy something (for Uber to help me make more), what’s the best way to do this?  How will it affect taxes, will I pay tax now? Or bad idea?
3.  Should I just leave the 401k alone with TransAmerica and some how find a way to contribute to it? 
4. Side question to number 2; I see TransAmerica offer a loan with fixed interest, but pay back is through pay roll and I remember they said other options is up to employer. Granted I don’t work for them anymore, will it get approve and I can pay for it directly? Or just bad idea? (I was gonna use it to consolidate some debt and get a lower interest rate) 

I appreciate any help and answers.  Again sorry if it’s a burden here.  I just feel lost, and that I could be making some bad decisions.",finance

Nathaniel Popper, a reporter at The New York Times who covers finance and technology, chronicles the history of the earliest bitcoin supporters in his 2015 book, including the stories of key players like the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler (who reportedly became the first ""bitcoin billionaires"" when the cryptocurrency's value breached $10,000 in November) and bitcoin's mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto.

""Bitcoin may be a product of computer science, but it is a very human story. ... This highly entertaining history reminds us yet again that truth can be stranger than fiction,"" former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers says of the book.

Forex,The sit down by u/usmaan516,"This is the sit down where I discuss topics that are prevalent for new and existing traders they you need to consider and understand before attempting to learn forex.

I have been in this sub for the last 2 years and have seen the same traders post the same things over and over again. New trades asking for strategies or tips on how to be profitable or just general questions that shouldn’t really be questions.

Most of the time they are given good answers but I felt I needed to compile a list of shit all new and existing traders need to know before you start your journey

This is part 1 and I will make a part 2 and maybe part 3 later on

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Point 1: The sidebar. The most important thing you need to do is read the fucking sidebar. It has a compiled list of free shit you can learn from but it still surprises me when people ask “WhErE cAn I fInD pRoFiTaBlE sTrAtegy”. Check the sidebar, seriously, as you will find books, websites podcasts and all sorts of stuff that WILL help you. Even if you think you know it all check it out anyways. If you don't know where it is check [this out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/wiki/index)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Point 2: Don’t come here expecting to make $1,000,000 from a tiny deposit of $100. If I were to ask you to go to the casino with $100 and bring me back a million would you be able to? Fuck no. So why are you coming into forex with the expectation of 6 figure trading days when you only have a $500 account.

Can you turn $100 into a million? Probably. But you aren’t going to do that in a week or a month and most definitely not overnight so get rid of that mentality.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Point 3: Treat trading like a hobby. This is the best way to approach trading. It’s not a new job you picked up or a brand new get rich opportunity but it’s a hobby just like a sport or knitting.

When you start out you know nothing and don’t really expect to make money doing it has you grow and learn you get way better and you are now able to knit really cool scarves or make insane 3 point shooters. And then you think hmmm maybe I can sell these scarves or play for a basketball team to make money from this.

You need to approach trading the same way. Your main goal to begin with is to learn  and understand the markets. You need to know them like the back of your hand. You need to test, research and learn everything about forex. You need to be able to say why price just took a 100 pip shit or why \[this news\] made price react in the way it did. You need to know what support and resistance is and how to plot it and how to accurately and quickly analyse and breakdown price action. Once you know all that then you are able to put money on the line and follow a trading plan as you will know (from your backtesting) that “Ok price is at this support level at 104.2 and i know from my backtesting that whenever price reaches this line and makes a bullish engulfing candle at 2PM GMT there is a 96.4% chance of price moving away from this support level”. This is where you make your money but having this level of knowledge and experience takes time so don’t expect to learn this overnight.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Point 4: The market is a whale. That’s right. That $5 trillion traded daily is a moby dick on steroids. And you as a trader are a little mosquito. Your single job is to extract a little blood here and there to keep yourself fed. If you try and take too much blood, the whale will notice and flick you off. So your job is not to bleed the whale dry but it’s to take a little here and there.

How does this translate into trading? Well firstly it’s probably a lot better to go the way the whale is going to get some blood right?! So that means you need to trade with the trend and not against it. That doesn’t mean you can’t trade counter trend but it means you will probably make a lot more trading with the trend rather than against it. Secondly, it’s a lot better to get a little profit here and there rather than trying to hold on for a lot of profit. This applies to swing traders also as even though you’re holding your positions long term it’s essential to not get greedy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Point 5: Education. The internet is a wonderful place with cats and porn so why not use it to your advantage. Use babypips.com and YouTube to learn. No need to pay some failed trader turned marketing pro to teach you when you can do it for free. Sure it will take longer but the money you save on education you can put into a trading account.

If you insist on finding a teacher make sure he/she is extremely transparent. Ask for trading history that can be verified (myfxbook not meta trader 4 screenshots). Also make sure you checkout the myfxbook portfolio personally as inspect element exists. Also make sure to pay with a method that means you can get your money back if you are not happy (PayPal not bank transfer). Remember you are paying for the traders time and experience so is it really worth it to pay a 22 yr old who claims he makes 100,000 a day or a 40 yr old who has traded for 30 years. It’s your money after all. Also DO NOT BUY SIGNALS. NO MATTER HOW MANY PIPS THEY PROMISE YOU ITS ALL FAKE. (If you insist on paying an Instagram educator or buying signals dm me instead and send the money to me so I can buy cocaine with it if you insist on wasting your money).

These ""traders"" don't make money from trading, they make it from selling their shitty courses and from you signing up to their preferred broker [via commission motherfucker](https://memes.getyarn.io/yarn-clip/64c55a50-1bc9-4700-8226-c5dcc436f6ea).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Point 6: Trading plans. Do you need one?

Here’s an analogy to help you understand. Go to the gym without a workout plan and train for 2 months then come back and tell me what you gained. Now go back to the gym with a workout plan and come back.

Do you think you will get ripped doing random shit everyday for 2 months or do you think you would get ripped if you went in everyday knowing exactly what exercises to do and how many sets and reps you had to do?

Obviously it’s the latter as you are consistently hitting the same muscle forcing growth whereas before your workouts were all over the place and weren’t actually doing anything for you.

You need to implement this into your trading. If you go into the markets everyday having no idea what you are looking for and just making trades for the fun of it, do you think you will actually become profitable?. If you do then close this thread and fuck off please. If you don’t then you have at least 2 brain cells to rub together and can realise that having a plan lets you know exactly what you are looking for and can help you to make the same  high quality trades every time. Being a good trader means being consistent and a trading plan is the key to consistency.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Point 7: Patience. Patience is key in this game. You could spend an entire decade in drawdown but you still need to be patient for the profitable days to come. Most traders shit themselves when they see price head down to their stop and they quickly close out their positions to prevent loss only to see price shoot up to their take profit. They don’t have patience. You could spend 6 months learning how to trade and finally get it on the 7th month but if you gave up back in month 5, you wouldn't get them sweet pips.

The questions you need to ask yourself is “ Is the idea of forex good enough for you to eat shit(figuratively) for x amount of years in order to achieve success?”. Are you willing to endure long hours working on strategies that aren’t profitable but help you learn?. If your answer is no to these then maybe you need to rethink your choices.

In the same way you spent 3 years studying for a degree to get a job, you need to spend x amount of years learning and testing to finally be able to understand and make money from forex.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Point 8: HoW mUcH mOnEy CaN I MaKe? This is the biggest question I see everywhere mostly asked by newbie or novice traders. I’m sure there are plenty of threads on Reddit so I’ll be blunt. The short answer, a fuck ton. Enough that you need to hire someone to count it for you.

But can I make that much? Unless you start with a small loan of $100,000,000 and can make 6% a year to make $6,000,000 then no. But you can eventually. The “pros” you see and are held accountable against who make 6% a month are able to do that due to the immense size of their accounts. They aren’t pros who are living big shot lives earning 6% of $1000 a month but instead they are earning 6% of a $1,000,000 account a month which equates to $60,000 a month.

You and your $1000 account will be able to manage returns, percentage wise, that are higher than that but when you have a million trading account, your main concern is capital preservation for the long term and not making 100M from that 1M.

In short there is plenty of money to be made but you need to be patient and have a large trading account. If your concern is money then you need to look long term not short term. Don’t come into forex expecting to pay your rent on Friday cos you WILL lose your money but instead look at eventually taking over your job with forex income.

Newbies DO NOT misunderstand this and think that you can take $100 to a million in a short amount of time. You require a high amount of self discipline to even consider doing this and you can't expect to be a millionaire if you are still closing positions before they hit your stop because you're scared. 

Think of it as a job. You are now in an entry level position earning $0 but you are learning the industry. As your knowledge increases, so does your paycheck and when you have many years of experience under your belt, then and only then can you start making the big bucks.

You can’t expect to go from a trainee to CEO in a week so why expect to do the same in forex.

&amp;#x200B;

This is enough for now but I will be back for part 2. I don’t care if you read this or not but this is for the newbie traders of now and the future.",finance

personalfinance,"Reddit ad: ""Use HARP to reduce your mortgage! No fees!"" --&gt; ""Here are 30 quotes with $6,000+ refinance fees.""","The title says it all.

I'm working through a home mortgage from about five years ago. The initial mortgage rate was good, and I refinanced two years later to a slightly lower interest rate. About once a year, I revisit the issue to see if I can get a better deal; and for the past three years, I've found that rates are going up and there's no better offer on the table.

So I ran across this Reddit ad:

&gt; HARP is going to expire in 2018. If you own a home and owe less than $679,650, use Congress's **free** refi program. The program itself is **totally free** and **doesn't add any cost to your refi**. Calculate how much your payment could be reduced by. (See Savings **For Free**).

...and decided to check it out, suspecting to find nothing. Well, I was right: all of the rates are higher. To my surprise, I also find that every offer tacked on $6k or more in new fees.

I see the subtle disclaimer in the ad above: ""The program *itself* is totally free..."" - *i.e.*, banks are welcome to invoke the ""free"" program and then tack on whatever new fees they want, including fees that completely consume whatever savings the program conferred. But even so, the ad seems to go overboard to suggest that the *offer* is free, which runs contrary to all of the new fees tacked on by each and every lender.

Just curious what /r/personalfinance thinks of this.",finance
personalfinance,Here's how to find out if you can get ACA marketplace health insurance with premium tax credits during open enrollment before Dec 15. Includes links to federal and state web sites that let you browse before applying.,"I've seen some posts that indicate some people have had trouble figuring out if they're eligible for help paying for health insurance coverage on the ACA marketplace, aka Obamacare. Because the user interfaces may be hard to navigate, here is a quick guide. Open enrollment runs Nov 1 - Dec 15 for 2019 plan selection. 

--

**Federal ACA Marketplace**

First find out if you can get Medicaid or ACA marketplace coverage with premium tax credits based on your state and your income. Your projected 2019 household income needs to be between 100% and 400% federal poverty level for your tax household size to be eligible for the premium tax credits.

https://www.healthcare.gov/lower-costs/qualifying-for-lower-costs/

Next, browse anonymously to preview plans and prices before creating an account. 

https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/

Step 1: Enter ZIP code

Step 2: Are you enrolled in ACA plan this year?

Step 3: Who's in your tax household? (just you, or others)

Step 4: Enter age, sex, and other info

On this screen, leave ""Eligible for health coverage through job"" box unchecked if
your job offers insurance but the self-only coverage would cost more than 9.86% of 
your household income.

Step 5: Confirm

Step 6: Predict 2019 household income

This is next year's MAGI. It's AGI plus tax-exempt interest, nontaxable Social Security, and tax-exempt foreign earned income. It includes the AGI of your dependents only if they are required to file. Make sure you adjust this based on your anticipated 2019 adjusted gross income from all sources and your tax family composition. [more info](https://www.healthcare.gov/income-and-household-information/)

Result: Estimated savings overview 

This tells you the estimated premium tax credit monthly. This is calculated by taking second lowest cost Silver plan price for someone your age in your area and subtracting a required payment on your part that is calculated between 2.08% and 9.86% of your household income on a sliding scale. See IRS Form 8962 instructions Table 2 for details. [2019 info](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9wgr00/heres_how_to_find_out_if_you_can_get_aca/e9ln6vc/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=personalfinance)

This premium tax credit amount will be subtracted from the prices shown on the
plan browsing screen. The tax credit does not change based on what plan you pick. 
Exception: The tax credit will never be more than the actual cost of the plan you pick.

Hit Continue, Next, See all plans.

The list of plans may run several pages and will be a mix of all the plans,
organized by premium from lowest to highest. 

I recommend you look first at the Silver plans. You can quickly filter to do that.

Use Refine Results. Check Silver plans box. Apply Filters.

You can later Clear All Filters and then look just at Bronze plans.

The results screen shows the estimated monthly premium after the tax credit (with the original price in parentheses), the deductible, and out-of-pocket maximum.

For a particular plan, use Quick View to see page with more info and links to Summary of Benefits. Use Details for more information about plan.

When you are ready to actually enroll, go to the page to create an account.

https://www.healthcare.gov/create-account

**Other States**

Some states have their own ACA marketplace web sites.

Here are links to the main page and the browsing page that lets you
research if you're eligible for tax credits and cost sharing reductions
that affect the cost of insurance if you choose ACA marketplace coverage.

CryptoCurrency,Is XRP a security? The question is now sitting before the U.S. District Court in San Francisco.,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/fkbxc0hv7yx11.png

An ongoing legal battle between XRP investors and payments startup Ripple is entering its next phase.

Attorneys for Ripple Labs and its affiliated defendants filed to move a consolidated class-action lawsuit from its previous venue at the San Mateo Superior Court to the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, according to court documents published Wednesday.

The defendants argued that the consolidated suit matches the requirements for a case to be brought before the higher, federal court.

In addition to the request to change the venue, Ripple's attorneys hinted at the company's defense against the suit, which alleges that the XRP token is a security issued by Ripple. As part of the removal process, they wrote:

&gt;*""Plaintiffs do not allege that they lacked information about the nature of these transactions. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs claim that they were somehow injured because the Defendants were allegedly required to register XRP as a 'security' with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission ('SEC') but failed to do so.""*

personalfinance,"Realistically, how quickly could I be looking at buying a home? What steps could I be taking now to ease that process? [26, PA, average salary, high student debt]","Hello- I'm 26, live in greater Philadelphia, and I would like to exit the rental-trap scheme. We currently pay $1250 a month for a 1 bedroom in a blah area- complete with cockroaches, a landlord who fights fixing anything, you get the idea. Renting has been one shitshow after another going all the way back to college- before this, it was a neighbor's fire that destroyed half the units and almost killed me. Before that, it was mice and people smashing your car windows in. And so on.

I work in software and make ~$70k, with raises every year between $5-10k. That said, my outstanding student loans are also in that ballpark (21k in federal loans @ 4% and 45k in private loans @ 5%). I don't have more than an emergency fund in savings as I've been putting everything extra into fighting the loans, but I am taking advantage of my employer's 401k match. That account has maybe $30k, last I checked (that said, at 10% of my salary, it's a non-trivial amount flowing out every month).


Ideally, I want to start saving for this in a big way while not neglecting anything else. The problem is, after you deduct rent, utilities, loan payments (including the extra amount I'm paying), etc, I barely have anything left for myself, let alone trying to save the five-figure-bare-minumum you'd need. Some months there's a hundred bucks to squirrel away into the savings, some months it's $0. I've never even taken a vacation that wasn't just visiting family or something.

So, what are my options then? Keep up this grinding charade and if I'm lucky stop seeing cockroaches by the time I'm 40? Stop contributing as much to the 401k in order to get some money back to save for this? Withdrawal early from it (especially if the market tanks soon anyway)? Stop paying hundreds extra into the loan? I budget and trim wherever possible, but it's never enough to help. Is my job / salary a roadblock to any of the above? Given that this probably isn't happening soon anyway, what type of planning should I be doing now? 

TL;DR: Renting is draining my soul; I'd like to buy a house sooner rather than later. How long of a goal does this reasonably look to be? What can I do to make it happen / do I have any other options?",finance

personalfinance,I need help regarding which is better: one personal loan to pay off all my existing debt vs. keeping multiple accounts with balances open.,"Hey, so I'm in need of some advice regarding two options I feel I have to pay off my existing credit. Some quick background info on myself, I'm 33, with a fairly decent credit score (740ish) and just got a raise so I have some extra money each month I would like to use to pay off most/all of my existing credit before I start putting the majority of it into my savings account/IRA. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing I'm curious about is if it's better for my credit score to get a personal loan and use that to pay off all existing accounts, meaning then I have a single monthly payment, single interest rate, etc. OR if it's a better choice to continue having different accounts and paying more than the minimum payments as I have been. I get 20-30 pieces of mail a week telling me I'm pre-approved for loans, and while I'm not foolish enough to fall for most of those, there are places I can get a decent loan to pay off everything without getting an awful rate so I'm curious which is better.

personalfinance,"Buying First Home in Milwaukee (~$180-$200k): 30y/o, 82k saved, no debt, single. Buy or keep saving?","Howdy. I'm considering buying my first home before winter covers everything, or find a place to rent for 6 months, then buy next summer. With interest rates rising, I feel like buying now makes sense, even if that means my mortgage will be higher (initially) than I would prefer.

Useful Statistics:

* Savings: $82,000 (All in current investments).
* Salary: $57,000
* Take-Home Monthly Pay: $3,323
* Average monthly savings after all expenses averaged out over past 24 months (includes everything from food, bills, car repairs, etc): $2,200
* Rent: $300 (To parents)
* Car: 1999 Toyota Corolla with 200,000 miles. Good condition. Next car will be under $5000 to prioritize home, but car health is good now so not an immediate need. 
* Credit Score: 629 (It's down 116 points since June, unsure why). 
* Career: Video Producer. Held current job since 2015, plan to stay at this job into foreseeable future. 
* Parents and I agreed 5 years ago, that on January 1st 2019 I will move out. 
* Goal Mortgage: $830 (25% of monthly take home pay). 

The average house price I've seen that fits my qualifications lands between $170,000-$200,000, however, with only $82,000 down, my estimated mortgage is above my goal mortgage ($1000 est. vs. $830 goal). I've been debating getting an apartment, saving an additional $18,000 for an additional 6-12 months to have a down payment large enough to bring down the mortgage to a safe level long term. 

However with mortgage rate increases, I'm unsure if its wise to wait rather than lock in a 30 year rate now, spend roughly the same as I would on an apartment but on a home, then refinance in 5 years &amp; invest in principle to bring the mortgage to a lower level.

Bitcoin,Satoshi left a backdoor...,"Thanks for taking it easy on me in my first post, guys/gals.

It's emboldened me to bring something else up that I didn't want to include in my first post.

I'm sure you've read the title by now... and you're probably thinking I'm full of it, because you've scoured the code, as have thousand, yet nobody has been able to find the backdoor... The reason why nobody has found it is because you were looking in the wrong place... It's been in front of us the whole time, and despite it being right smack in front of our noses, it's not something you can simply hack (at least not yet), because it's built into the design.

I really hope that Satoshi truly was not one person, that if Satoshi really is/was one person then s/he isn't dead yet (for ease of reading, I will refer to Satoshi as ""they"" from now on, despite me not believing that), and that if they really were/are one person, that they shared what I'm about to tell you, or made provisions for it to be shared somehow with someone trustworthy and capable enough to handle it upon their death. Given their writings and the amount of forethought that went into every step of their actions, I truly believe that they did make provisions, but only time could tell us with any certainty.

I believe that Satoshi did this as a precaution. A protection, in case things go the wrong way. Playing out in my head the 4-dimensional global chess game of our current situation and how things are progressing, I think that there's a 50/50 chance of it still being needed... but I'm no  Edgar Roy.

Satoshi's backdoor necessitates a few things for it to not only be needed, but for it to be potentially successfully used.

First, the inevitable coming global financial crisis must be well underway. (I believe that the Satoshi's final card was meant to be the last-ditch resolution to the potential wars/famines/plagues/pestilences that this crisis can/will cause.)

Second, ""enough"" wealth transfer into bitcoin by not only the politically elite and wealthy, but also the masses, must have occurred. I used quotations because there is no concrete measure of this, so if the Satoshi are alive, they  will never know if it has been ""enough"" so they will therefore wait until the absolute last second to deploy this ""backdoor"". Hopefully, they won't have to... Keep in mind that adoption follows a logarithmic curve... so the window of opportunity to play Satoshi's final card will probably be very tight.

Third, the global financial crisis must have truly gotten to the point where it is so bad that the Satoshi have to believe that there is no longer any hope of peaceful and successful resolution without intervention in the face of potentially plunging the human race into the second Dark Ages.

I know what you're thinking... ""This goes against everything that Satoshi stood for! I refuse to believe that s/h/th/ey would have left a centralized backdoor like this!"" and you may very well be right, and I am looking forward to your adult, mature discussion about this, because I can't think of any other explanation. Hal Finney's death, IMO, is not a valid response, because you need to explain why he would have sat on all those BTC until his death, so this argument is still valid in that case. In fact, the only valid argument I can think of is that the Satoshi all died shortly after the last bitcoins were transferred into those wallets and they erased their tracks.

Keep in mind that the genesis of the Satoshi's actions and therefore the outcomes of those actions necessitated ""centralization"", and I think that they fully understood the centralization implications of them being the ""centralized birth"" of bitcoin.  Even though the Satoshi collaborated with many people, the original idea and ""spark"" was almost certainly from one mind... even if the Satoshi were/are an individual... When it comes down to it, ""centralization"" is necessary (at least temporarily) for progress to occur, because new ideas are formed in the (centralized) individual's mind, which is as small of a centralization as exists in the human race. If we eradicate centralization completely, the voice of the individual ceases to be heard. Imagine if we wouldn't have listened to Nikolai Tesla or Albert Einstein because their voices were too ""centralized"".

You don't believe that is ""centralization""? That must mean that you don't think that monarchies are centralized... Sure, this comparison can be poked at in many ways, if you really want to nitpick... it won't distract from the big picture, though.

I believe that the Satoshi fully understood that centralization can be a good thing in some situations, in order for individual sparks to be fanned, as long as it is backed by good intentions, kept free from corruption, and time limitations put in place. History has proven that remaining centralized for too long is never a good idea... After all, this is the reason that the most civilized countries put time limits on the terms that leaders can stay in power. The problem is figuring out how long ""too long"" is, ensuring a means of removing the centralization when it is no longer ""good"", and also a working definition of ""good"".

""Good"" luck...

I'm sure that if what I'm saying is true, the Satoshi made provisions for this ""backdoor"" to not remain ""centralized"" to them, once its utility was not needed any more... As far as when that utility would not be needed any more, I'll get to that later.

So what I believe the Satoshi's backdoor is, is simply the \~1.5m BTC (debatable, of course) that they own.

**Wait, please hear me out...**

Given the Satoshi's dedication to forethought, do you really believe that they didn't realize that in the future, any individual or conglomerate that owns 1.5m BTC would hold immense power? Do you really believe that they held onto that many (especially not distributing it over many wallets!) without having a REALLY GOOD reason for it? If you've read all of the Satoshi's writings, don't you think that they realized that by holding that many, it was almost a certainty that their holdings would eventually be discovered and they were going to be targeted in the future? IMO this was one of the primary reasons (if not THE primary reason) that they went into hiding...

They were altruistically holding the one global ""get out of jail free"" card, and knew that they were the only ones that could be trusted with it. Having said that, I really do believe that they did make provisions for it to not be lost in case of their untimely death, and let's not focus on the ""Satoshi is a number of individuals"" debate, because we won't get anywhere. This is all still applicable in either scenario.

So how did the Satoshi believe that their ""backdoor"" could be our ""get out of jail free"" card? Simple, really. Given the three assumptions I wrote above, Satoshi would anonymously declare himself, and prove his identity by moving X BTC from one of his addresses (probably to a charity IMO). The entire world would immediately come to attention, and as long as the world's fiats had already started collapsing enough, there would not be another viable store of wealth that is also useful for every day transactions. ""What about gold and silver?"" you say? Not a useful means of currency today. Sure, it'll always be a good store of wealth (until a vast gold mine is discovered somewhere on earth or another planet), but unless we truly do plunge back into the Dark Ages (in which case the Satoshi would have missed their window of opportunity and their card will become unplayable) global transactions will continue to be necessary, and gold is rather inconvenient and inefficient in that situation.

""What about altcoins?"" Whether or not you think that all altcoins will die, I don't think that bitcoin will ever lose its store of value. Let's assume that LN is unfortunately unsuccessful, and so is any future update to increase tps... At this point, even if we would never get to the level of using bitcoin for everyday transactions, the worst future for bitcoin would essentially turn it into a digital copy of gold... Slow, cumbersome, expensive and difficult to interact with for everyday small transactions, extremely difficult for global transactions. Yet, gold has held its ""value"" (buying power, not numerical price, which has all kinds of things affecting it) despite these (and more) drawbacks (especially when compared to bitcoin), and in the face of globalization and digitalization.  Yes, I know that transaction cost has gone down since January 2017... and you can show me all the data you want... but until we see what happens in the next bullrun (the best real-world simulation of mass adoption that is possible, outside of virtual mathematical simulations), there is nobody on this planet that can guarantee it to be prepared for true mass adoption, or that future developments will be successful. Nobody knows the future, which means that there are no guarantees, at least for us humans living in this 4-dimensional universe.

It's really all besides the point, though. Put simply: worst case scenario, at the very least, bitcoin will forever be a store of value, because it currently equals or exceeds gold in every aspect. As long as humans remain alive in any meaningful way and technology is not lost (this is, ultimately, the Satoshi's goal, is it not?), it will be impossible for it to not become a store of value because of its historical value as being ""the first"", and at the very least, it will turn into a ""collector's item"" due to its historical significance. Since there is no way to ""sell"" somebody your private keys without being certain that there are no other copies of the seed phrase, the ""future collectors"" will be forced to transfer it to their own wallet, which means that transactions on the blockchain will continue, and bitcoin will never ""die"" unless the human race is eradicated, or we evolve to the point that we eradicate money (in which case bitcoin won't even be needed any more, but most people alive today don't even have the capacity to visualize this as being not only possible, but also as a potentially desirable future for humans) as well as the human desire to ""collect"" (which won't have any effect if we truly evolve past ""money""). Like I said, though, worst case scenario, and if it will happen, it is quite far off. Definitely at least a few generations, unless we really get our butts in gear (highly unlikely).

Anyway, I digress.

At this point, you're probably asking: ""But what would the Satoshi do, after they publicly declare themselves and prove their identity?"" Well, here goes... Keep in mind that this is the Satoshi's last card... and that they would only do this if it got bad enough... but the timing has to be perfect because if they wait too long, they might lose the last hope we might have, if it comes down to it. They absolutely don't want to have to play the final card, either, unless they think it's absolutely necessary to keep us out of the Dark Ages, or worse. I'm sure that they are hoping that they won't have to, but just in the case that things don't turn out the way that they are hoping they will, I think they are planning to threaten to dump their btc all at once in order to crash it, unless the world leaders causing whatever strife stop what they were doing and start playing nice. Since by this point the world leaders would have converted even most of their own holdings primarily into btc/crypto and probably precious metals, they would not want that to happen.

Of course, the successful deployment of the Satoshi's final card is not foolproof... and if they are all still alive, then I'm sure they dread the possibility of the day arriving in which they deem that deployment cannot be prolonged. How soon could that day come? No human knows the answer to that, but every day shows us that it is still in the cards.

So when would the Satoshi's final card not be needed any more? Easy: if we can pull ourselves out of the coming financial crisis by peacefully converting fiats to crypto before wars/famines/plagues/pestilences kill too many, and we can peacefully focus on humans becoming an interplanetary species before another mass extinction level event happens, whether or not we cause it.  But, as Ron Paul recently said:

""***The first steps are passing the 'Audit the Fed' bill, allowing people to use alternative currencies, and exempting all transactions in precious metals and cryptocurrencies from capital gains taxes and other taxes.""***

Unfortunately, that seems like an alternate reality at this point, rather than even a far-off future, and every passing day seems to shift us closer to the possibility of the Satoshi's final card play being necessary, with no hope of change appearing yet on the horizon. Over the years, (in my mind, at least) the possible situations ending in the Satoshi's final card not needing to be played have one by one been invalidated, until now it truly hangs almost precisely in the balance at about 50%. One can only hope, though, that if it comes down to it being necessary, the Satoshi's final card will be played so masterfully and skillfully that it will be the game-ending Final-Boss-killing ""Ultimate Fatality"" to fiats and currency mismanagement by those who wish to oppress, truly the ""Trump to end all Trumps"" (no potential future pun intended? please don't let it come to that?).

One way or another, the illusion of time marches on, and most people alive today will probably have to witness the Satoshi's final card being played. Every day, more cycles and signs converge in this direction. The coming years are going to be one heck of a doozy, so invest and prepare wisely, and make sure you bring lots of popcorn... and let's just hope that the dolphins aren't all going to disappear one day.

***""The way I see it, there's only two possible outcomes: either I make it down there in one piece and I have one hell of a story to tell, or I burn up in the next ten minutes. Either way, whichever way, no harm no foul, 'cause either way, it'll be one hell of a ride. I'm ready."" -Ryan Stone***

What do you guys think? Since the Satoshi didn't ""pull a Charlie Lee"", can you justify them holding onto that many BTC in any other way, given their writings, level of forethought, and philosophical alignment? Or do you think that they died before spending or selling any?  Do you think the Satoshi created a ""Bitcoiniminati"" that will pass the keys down before/if they die? Most importantly, do you think that it will come down to the Satoshi having to play their final card when all hope seems lost in the 11th hour (as humans seem to have a knack for) and will we see a time when it is safe for the Satoshi to reveal their true identity?

Basically, he and I had a discussion about the difference between keeping my long-term funds in my Fidelity mutual/index funds vs a Jackson National Life Insurance ""Elite Access"" variable annuity fund. The current amount that I have to move is about $100k. And this is money that barring a nightmarish series of events I won't have to touch for decades.

His argument was that I should get at least some of my money in a tax sheltered account (which after some research I know he was just trying to make it sound a little better than it is, I wish he called it tax deferred) and that it's better growth in one of the Jackson annuities because of the tax deferral instead of paying capital gains tax on my non-qualified accounts. The fees associated with the Fidelity accounts are 0.045% (index fund), 0.74%, and 0.88%. the fees with the Jackson annuity would be 1% annually for Jackson's cut then each sub-investment have fees between 0.53% and 2.5%.

So to me it seems like the fees would be more harmful to the account than paying the capital gains tax.

personalfinance,Am I really in the clear? Something is wrong...,"Throw away because humiliation. Also, a long, complicated story I'm going to try to make very short and sweet. ... 
So, about 10-11 years ago a cousin of mine, a successful attorney, promised me to pay for my college. As long as my grades were exceptional and classes were attended he would pay for the whole thing. Everything. It was agreed in writing, etc, etc. He was my CO-signer. He did not want to be the sole note holder in case I screwed the pooch and failed out. I had skin in the game in his mind. I did as was told; had a GPA of 3.8+, perfect attendance, lots of awards, voted by the class as the most likely to succeed, the whole lot... I did exceptionally well. 

During this time my cousin encouraged me to retrieve as much loan money as I could, federally and privately. ""It will be the cheapest money you can ever get and I'll be paying it back anyway."" Who could argue with that? I knew I would be a success so I wasn't worried. I'm would guessing total loans to be appx $80k. This covered all tuition, room and board, and literally any other expense I had through school and about the first six months after graduation. Seemed like a good situation. I had about $10k in debt otherwise.. A credit card, a car, a small personal loan, nothing unmanageable. 

As soon as my deferment was over after school, the phone calls started coming in for loan payments. When I confronted my cousin he basically denied that he ever agreed to pay for anything. Remember how I had this all in writing? Well, 2007/2008 hit everyone hard. My immediate family suffered a four volume novel of bullshit that would take hours upon hours to read, let alone type. Let it suffice to say that paying these student loans was not only impossible but not even close to the middle of the list of my family's worries (health, legal, financial, you name it...). All the e-mails we had, all the paperwork between us, everything was lost. Domains weren't paid, multiple business office moves left paperwork behind, foreclosures and property loss basically decimated any information myself or my family had about this. 

This required that I go home to my family and help. It was a total mess. I stopped paying my bills. Well, all debts. I just became a cash person. Didn't answer a call from a number I didn't know, ignored bill collectors in the mail... Just stopped having anything to do with the credit system. 

Ten years passed. Life is different. I've found success somehow without credit at all but now it's time to grow up. No more bullshit, right? It's time to address my issues. My girlfriend and I want to rent an apartment, after all, and maybe even one day buy a house, yadda yadda yadda. It's time to check the dreaded credit score.

The only debt I have is $377 for a capital one card that I applied for, and was surprisingly approved for, on a whim. 

How is this possible? My father and I share a first name and last name but we obviously have different SSNs and I would imagine that he has more than $377 worth of debt. 

I am truly dumbfounded. How is this possible? Am I... Am I in the clear, somehow? Did everyone just give up on me and drop all my records? I still receive calls from numbers I don't recognize and when I google those numbers they show up as creditors... What is going on here?

gaming,What's wrong with Resident Evil 7? This game blew my mind away. [SPOILER],"I am in real shock. This game fails all logics of life and gameplay literally makes no sense. I know that it's a zombie horror game, but how can it be so terrible. The main character Ethan starts by entering an old house, such a cliché, and gets locked inside it. Typical classic horror scene in which locked door can't be opened from inside. The next thing blew my mind. I played the video and suddenly I am in the video. Okay, something new, even if it's stupid. This guy goes with other guy to find their other friend, but finds him dead and they gets attacked. Ethan, somehow thinking it will be a good idea to follow them, follows them instead of getting the hell out of that house. Well, he finds Mia. Happy reunion? No. She doesn't tell Ethan that she's a monster and Ethan should run away from her, when she had the chance. When Ethan gets an axe, I though yes finally I got a great weapon. Right? No. Mia is like an axe-sponge. That axe can't split the head open. IMO, give axe to Mia and she will show how to use axe right. After killing Mia for first time, Zoe calls and tells him to get out of house. Amazingly, an axe can't get you out of the house, because writers said so. I asked myself, how incredibly stupid this game can get. I regret asking that. Mia attacks me with chainsaw and cuts my hand, then runs away, without killing me completely. And, I lost my axe. When I reached the attic and got gun to kill Mia, she is bullet-sponge now. After finally killing her, some guy comes and beats the hell out me. Before that, I couldn't pick the electric saw to cut his bloody head off. Sure. After being kidnapped and doing several things, a cop comes to rescue me but dies, another cliché. I gets the gun but he his also bullet sponge. I cuts him with knife, then he starts driving car and that speed can only happen in video game. He blows the car up but Ethan survives and his body survives with just a few burns. He comes to me and dies. Somehow, Ethan can't pick up his weapon too. Like, is there anything more stupid than this? Yes. The garage door doesn't open after getting closed. Seriously? After going to main hall, he comes back to hunt me and now he won't die. And even when he dies for like few seconds, I can't pick his weapon to slice that head off him. I am fed up with this game.",technology
personalfinance,What to do with money when planning to move overseas (unsure if temporary or long term)?,"Hi personalfinance, 

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty well aligned with the flowchart provided in the Wiki, excluding retirement and investments, because I can’t work out how to do this in the context of an overseas move. I am looking to move overseas on a two-year WHV (with the possibility of staying long term or moving back to Australia/ somewhere new afterwards). This would likely take place in 1-2 years, and I am currently looking into moving to Montreal.

&amp;#x200B;

About me: I am 22, recent engineering grad living in Sydney making AUD$70k ($1950 take home fortnightly after tax and student loans, I spend on average $1000 fortnightly and save the rest). I have just over $70k in a HISA at 2.5%, and then about $10k in retirement (from 9.5% employer retirement contributions).

&amp;#x200B;

I have about AUD$50k in student debt with the Australian government, but this is increased in line with the consumer price index and so far hasn’t exceeded my HISA interest rates, so I am not focused on paying it off. I am not obligated to put any money towards it if I earn below the \~$50k threshold in a given financial year.

&amp;#x200B;

My financial goals are:

* To support an overseas move, including potential gaps in employment (medium term)
* To cover cost of wedding (medium term)
* Potentially to fund further study or a career change (medium-long term)
* To buy a home (long term and not quite sure where at this stage)

&amp;#x200B;

My major concerns are:

* I am afraid of making personal contributions to a retirement fund which I may not be able to access or may have to liquidate and thus receive a penalty 
* I am afraid of locking money away into a Vanguard fund or similar and then facing issues with tax, withdrawals, etc. if I am living overseas (or if I purchase the funds outside of Aus and then move back)
* I am afraid of blowing my savings moving overseas, taking a hit in income working in a new country, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, I am happy leaving my extra cash in my HISA. But long term, I don’t think that that’s the most sensible option – especially when it comes to buying a house and retiring. I would consider myself pretty good at “day to day” financial management, but I am not very knowledgeable about the long term. So any advice would be appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

I am also keen to hear about any experiences you’ve had living and working overseas, especially early on in your career, and the impacts financially and career-wise.

personalfinance,"I have quite a bit of money but feel discouraged by the interest rates in my country, what are my options?","I currently have about $10к in my bank account, and here are a few facts on my situation:

* I live in Belarus (**so I'm not looking for specific instructions here, but rather for a general advice**);
* the average wage in Belarus is about $400 / month. I earn significantly more - $1500/month - I work in IT;
* I have no credits, nor debt;
* I'm renting for $300/month;
* I'm considering to buy an apartment, but not in the nearest year for sure;
* I have about $10,000 on my bank account, in Belarussian rubles (BYN) - it just sits there and gets eaten by the inflation;
* btw the inflation is all the time low at the moment and expected to be below 7% by the end of the year;
* we had quite a few major financial instabilities in the past - just recently in 2011, our currency dropped 30%.

So, I'm stressed because I feel like a have a ton of money (comparing to others in my country, of course), but I'm anxious I'm going to lose it.

So I researched deposits with interest in my country... but it's discouraging. Yearly interests are about 8% (it's 6.5% after taxed) for deposits in BYN. And for USD it's \~1% rate, for EUR it's \~0.5%. Yes, that's YEARLY!

\-- Soo.. in the best-case scenario I just don't lose a lot due to inflation? And I'm not earning anything this way.

Also, the exchange rate doesn't change much for the past couple of years, so just buying USD / EUR (to be safe from BYN dropping again) also doesn't seem right.

\-- Soo.. I could convert my money into more stable currency, but if I need to withdraw at some point and situation stays stable in my country, I'm going to lose some money due to conversion rates.

I could buy an apartment, I guess - ""invest in the real estate"", so to say. But here are some problems too:

* I don't yet know in which city I'm going to live in a year from now;
* if it's Minsk (our capital, most likely for me to stay here) - I'd need about $50,000 credit for a decent flat;
* as far as I asked around with my wage it's possible to get that credit, but rates are ridiculous. It's 14-16% yearly at the moment for 10-15-20 years credits.

So, in the end, I'm sitting on a pile of cash. I know I'm not doing my best with finances. And all the options seem like they do not worth the effort.

I have the money, more than most people around me, but I'm extremely stressed about it. What a joke.",finance

personalfinance,Pay mortgage?,"Hello everyone. My mother passed recently and with it came the insurance money plus house value. Right now, I know I should get something like 93k from the insurance money. If I counted right, there's maybe another 75k for my part on the house.

I myself have no debt except mortgage on my house. It's a new one for 25 years, 2.5 years made in the term, 2.5 to go. The current rate is 2.65%. It's a closed fixed term. There's about 247k remaining on it.

I pay about 600 each two week, which is about 350 capital and the remaining in interest. Since it's a closed term, I cannot just put money on the capital else I get penalty. I checked and it's multiple thousands so I won't go this route. But I do have many possibility.

First, I can increase, once a year, how much money is taken each payment, up to a double, until end of term. So I could switch to 1200 instead of 600, then next year 2400.

I can also add a direct payment each time there's a withdrawal, an extra payment. These, I must ask them to do it each time. Again, I cannot go over the current term payment. That mean, once it's doubles, I could ask them each 2 weeks to take another 1200 and 2400.

In all, I calculated that once my 2.5years term ended, I have liquidated nearly all of the insurance and house money I got, but left with a 50k mortgage.

I already have about 16k in an account for emergency and I have a steady and sure job (work for government) which include a retirement plan. Paid each week. Right now  the mortgage paiement plus savings for taxes and my own personal savings (money going into multiple account for either payment or extra like vacation, emerngy fund and gifts) take 1 paycheck every 2 week.

What do you think of that plan? I have everything in my possibility to manage all these payment by themself. Some people tell me to invest them, because my interest fee are low, but investment fee and interest rate aren't that great and current mortgage rate are raising higher and higher. With that scenario, I could end up with a paid house (and totally debt free) by my 40 birthday (or even before), and getting back in my pocket 26 paycheck a year that currently goes to the mortgage. I could invest this money or more, but I think living debt free earlier is better then trying to invest, since any amount of interest to cover the interest from a 260k mortgage require more then 5%. I calculated about 50k interest saving by doing my strategy.

Thank you",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing student loans crushed my credit score? How can I fix it?,"It’s been ten years since I got out of college. I have several loans (federal and private). Just totally paid off the federal, and refinanced all the private left into a great deal! 3% fixed for 5 years. Going to save me tons.

Is there anything I can do? I’m so frustrated I did the right thing financially and am getting penalized for it bc of the credit history - they can still see I had those payments ON TIME for ten years so why does it just suddenly not count?

personalfinance,"Should I apply to a MS Degree program I am interested in, or handle my current (mid-large) debt load first?","I graduated college in Dec 2015 with an actuarial science degree, and have since found myself working as a financial analyst for around $58K. I am interested in transitioning to a Data Analyst path, potentially, as I find I like working with large data sets, and the (currently small) amount of programming language work I get to do, as well as working with other relevant software. Seems like I have a decent stats/math background, but need to pick up the tech stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

I found a program with the college I graduated from that would be a MS of Business Analytics and Project Management. I only care about the first half of that, but it isn't like project management would hurt to have. The degree is 37 credits, at 900 a pop. So if I'm taking it part time, I'm looking at something like 12 credits a year for 3 years. $10.8K per year. Or easier to think about, just $900 per month. Now I don't have $900 in excess take home per month, so it might involve splitting it between loans and pay as I go. Issue is I already have a lot of student &amp; car debt, and I'm not so sure about adding to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Debt:

\~23K Private student loans &amp; 4%

\~30K Federal student loans at 4%

\~12K Car at 6%

&amp;#x200B;

$20K in savings. 

My bills are a bit up in the air right now because I am in the process of moving, but they pan out to something like:

$750 housing (all inclusive, after split with roommate. might be conservative, not sure how electricity will be).

$200-250 groceries

$70 gym (climbing)

$280 private student loans

$360 federal student loans

$285 car loans

Then another 100-200 for misc stuff that comes through.

&amp;#x200B;

I make 58K a year, which is something like $3500 a month. Less $2,200 a month puts me at $1,350 left over. Alright so this is more than the $900 I'd need for classes. But I didn't have a roomate prior, so I am adjusting to having this amount verse the $400 or so up until now.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan was that I would dump 12K of my savings into just paying off my car immediately, once my life settles down again after the recent job change &amp; move. Then save back up to the $20K or so mark again and start paying down my other student loans with that extra money. So I guess the big question is should I focus on tackling my current student debt, or is it worth while to pursue this MS program and accept having my debt for longer (and possibly adding to it, depending on how cash flows pan out over the 3 years)?

&amp;#x200B;

This is the first time I’ve run into a lump of cash.

For some background:

I currently have about 3k in my checking account, I have a Roth IRA that has been stagnant with the volatile market this year with about 7600 dollars in it.

I’m 27, I have a credit card with a 3000 dollar max, and I owe 1000 dollars on my card.

My Fiancée and I are getting married in the spring late May, and we just took out a 10k loan to help with wedding expenses.

I owe close to 22k in student loan debt, I am signed up for the income based repayment plan at 20 years. ( right out of college I stayed in the 10year standard plan, did not have a great job with real money until now, so those payments were crippling at 330 a month I did that for a 2 years, got fed up with always just getting by, and decided to go for IBR plan with the attraction to more money in my pocket now, wipe the remainder of the debt away after the 20year mark )

I know I am paying more in the long run but my plan is to chip away with extra payment chunks here and there when I stumble across money. should probably make a separate post to discuss best strategy for that student loan but just giving you guys some back ground.

I have a loan for my car and owe 11k 

Near future plans: looking for a house in about a year or two if that is realistic. Kids are in the future as well about a year or two away. 

I’m salaried at 52k the bonus put me up to 66k before taxes. 

I really really want to be smart with this money. We have good out standing credit scores and I’ve never missed a payment on anything.  My thoughts were to: 

1. Pay off credit card (-1000)
2. Buy a 600-700 dollar laptop that I need for work (-700) 
3.  Put 2k towards the 6yr wedding Loan (-2000)
4. 2k towards student loan directed at the highest interest loan (-2000) 

5. I’m left with 2900 and just feel scattered, I want the most bang for my buck the most beneficial moves with this money. Maybe throw 1k - 2k towards my car, and then just save the remainder.

It's a possibility that I may not get any work at all this week. And my federal student loans are going into principle on December 2nd with a minimum payment of nearly 600 dollars.

1. If I keep getting no hours due to lack of work over the course of longer than a week, can I apply for unemployment? Or does that require me quitting my position?

2. I have no idea at all when the work is coming back. My boss also does not know. Should I begin looking for part-time evening work (serving, bartending) or should I apply for new engineering positions?

Background info: 
•Peace corps beginning early next year = 27 months serving abroad with minimal expenses beyond what you’re compensated for, but not making enough to save really anything. 
•No federal tax return during this time (your pay is extremely low, at the level of the community you live in, guidance from 2015 says no fed. Tax return is required). Permanent address with family in Florida, so state won’t be an issue. 
•Savings I won’t need access to for that time frame - for easy round numbers, let’s just say $50k not including an emergency fund left in an online savings account and plenty of cushion in case I come home early for some reason.
•My financial advisor at Wellfargo advisors handed me off to someone else in the last year, and I don’t particularly like or trust him. Even if I use WF, I’ll probably do the Intuitive investor which is a lower fee using the same portfolio options this advisor is using anyways.
•Note: I have NO idea what I’ll do after service, but I basically have a guaranteed well-paying job with my current company if I want it as a backup and family I could stay with in a few different cities where we have offices at minimal costs if needed.

Comparing the WF Advisors options to robo-investing options is a bit overwhelming. Nobody in my life in my family, friend groups, coworkers, etc seem to do anything at all with their money because it terrifies them. Any insight into pros/cons beyond what a typical internet search will give you would be helpful!

BS in Risk Analysis (IT/Stats type hybrid) in '10, since then I've worked in the US intel community doing all kinds of fun stuff, used my background to help pioneer some pretty cool data innovations for one of the big three letter agencies. I consider myself more a intel analyst/data analyst combo, but my job title has been 'Data Scientist' on a number of occasions, enough that I'm known as a Data Scientist in the USIC (again, non-tech people assigning titles here). I'm half way through my MS in Data Science from a well known university. I'm also looking to transition out of DC to a smaller town (Philly area), and as such would probably leave my roll in the USIC where I have built quite a good reputation....

Jumping back into the job market has been a bit of a shock, and I attribute this mostly to the complete lack of awareness surrounding the definition of 'Data Science'. For every 10 job postings for Data Scientists that I've looked at, I feel like everyone is a completely different job and covers such a wide set of skills that I feel woefully underprepared for any of them. 

I have a good grasp on statistics, I can code/know R/Python/VB/SAS/SQL (although I wouldn't consider myself 'coder fluent', I can figure out anything, it just takes time and some SO/google-fu), I'm a capable business person (I've briefed to high level stakeholders, can communicate and write well, etc...), my critical thinking/data munging/manipulation I would class as 'expert'. So at the core, I feel like a competent 'true data scientist'...

So this is where my question really begins - 

We've all seen some version of the [DS venn-diagram](http://www.prooffreader.com/2016/09/battle-of-data-science-venn-diagrams.html)...and thats all fine and dandy, but I dont think that accurately represents what companies want in a DS. So what skills do I need to work on to be that more complete package, and how do I go about learning the skills? 

**TL;DR: For someone who already has stat/coding/domain knowledge - what are the full life cycle DS processes that one would also have to be fluent in, or at least have a strong grasp of - especially in a full stack perspective - and subsequently what are the best ways to learn them.**",technology
personalfinance,"Getting my finances straightened out for the first time in my life, working out a budget.","As the title says, I'm formulating a budget for myself. Long story short, my pickup when kaboom, and got caught with my pants down, as I owed $3,800 on it with no cash in savings whatsoever. Thankfully, my bank was there to help me out and a dealership in town helped me get into a dependable rig. BUT I'm wanting to plan for this event to happen again, as it was the worst case scenario. My budget I've put together is this....

INCOME: $1,602 monthly. (Farm and ranch hand, house and all but internet is paid for as part of my end of year income)

BILLS

Pickup payment: $350 monthly (a hair above what the minimum is, will pay $350 every month even with the minimum lowering to pay off interest quicker over time.) 

Student loan: $120 monthly (more than the minimum, always stays the same, as that's what I set it at for auto-pay to get a cut on interest rates) 

Auto insurance: ~$125 monthly (calling to add the new pickup onto insurance, this is kind of the ballpark I was quoted for a similar rig, will edit this after I get a solid price) 

Adobe Lightroom: $5 monthly 

Internet: $88 monthly

Amazon Prime: $13 monthly

Cell phone: $122

Gas: ~ $50 - $100 monthly

Groceries: ~$250 monthly

With the total outgoing, I'm left with somewhere around $400 - $450 a month left over. I was figuring to put around $200 - $250 a month into an emergency fund sort of account, then leave the rest to use as a fun money account for the month, and whatever I don't use from that, I could put into the savings as the next month comes around. 

Is this budget sound? What can I work differently? Also, I should add that I will be getting a bonus somewhere around February or March that will be at least $600 if not a little more, then another around June or July for the same or more again, which may be rat-holed away or used for necessities that come up such as new tires, work clothes, processing for my half beef, etc. Any input is appreciated, thank you!",finance

She called her lender, Flagship Credit Acceptance, who has awful reviews as it is, and they said if she paid her next bill of $502, he can put in a form to his manager as a hardship, and reduce the loan to 4-5% APR, and extend the loan by 6 months, reducing the monthly payment amount.

personalfinance,20 YO with $14k in his checking acct,"I’m so proud of my youngest. He wasn’t interested in going to college right out of high school so he opted to go to work directly after graduation. He’s been employed ever since (2+ years) and saves most of his money. He pays some rent, bought a car, pays his own cell and insurance bills but other than that he really doesn’t spend much. He’s got over 14,000 in the bank now but it’s just sitting in a regular checking account at a credit union.   

I’ve mentioned to him several times he should look at something like CDs to increase his interest rate but he has no interest in financial planning and whenever I try to bring up things like planning for retirement or maximizing his savings his eyes glaze over and he changes the subject. He told me once that the ladies at the bank even asked him if he wanted to move some money into CDs when is balance hit 10 K but he wasn’t interested in learning about them. 

 What are some good options for a young person to invest at that level? Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get him to be more receptive to these conversations?

personalfinance,(CAN) Is it best to use a cash repository to pay off a mortgage vs. using monthly income? (CAN),"I'm trying to wrap my head around buying a house and a thought just dawned on me. Figured I would push this out to this community and get people's ideas. 

I'm a sales person with fluctuating income, living in Toronto. I'm meticulous with my spending, and obsessive about tracking monthly income vs. expenses, + investments - liabilities = net worth. 

I was just running number and figured the following: 

$800K cost of condo
20% down payment = $160k
Mortgage = $640k 
Interest Rate of 3.84% for 3 year fixed rate (just got this off TD's website), would mean $777.21/week = $40,414.92/year, plus condo fees &amp; property taxes = $52,438.90.

Based on fluctuating income, a thought dawned on me: would it make sense to open some sort of low interest savings account and sock ~53k into it, and then draw it down weekly to pay off the mortgage vs. use my monthly income to pay the mortgage. 

My dilemma is, that ~53k could yield ~$4,240/year @ 8%, or realistically much more if it were combined with my other investment accounts and left to compound y/y. However, having the 53k there for the explicit use of paying off the mortgage would eliminate any stress associated to the peaks and valleys of making 50%+ of your income off commission. The goal would be to replenish this ~53k with another lump sum accumulated through savings/investing of my monthly income. 

Am I over analyzing this? Is there a better option?",finance

It was about a 3k loan. Well fast forward about a month and under certain circumstances I'll be getting a good chunk of money (enough to pay off the car a have a little left over). So, I was wondering if it would be wise for me to pay off the car loan in one payment? There is no penalty for early pay off. But, I was wondering if this would screw the CU over, and hurt my relationship with them in the future, since I'd definitely be banking with them again. They make money off interest over the term of the loan, so wouldn't them going through with one and suddenly closing it be a big waste of time for them? Also, would it be detrimental to my credit to have a loan, then poof, it's paid off? Am I not supposed to keep paying on things to show my accountability to maintain lines of credit?

personalfinance,Questions before filing Chapter 7,"Hi everyone:

First off, my apologies for the length of this post.  I'm hoping to preempt all the questions that would almost certainly follow a shorter one. As riveting as this tale may be, you can probably skip to the bottom for my questions.

This sub has been enormously helpful to me over the past few months, as I've negotiated my extrication from a bad business partnership -- word to the wise: don't go into business with someone with a narcissistic personality disorder! -- and have had to take a hard look at my finances.  That said, I have a few issues that I haven't seen addressed here and I'm hoping you good people can be as helpful to me as you have been to others.  

Some background, first . . .  

I'm 56, and started this business about three years ago.  At the time, I had no debt (other than an auto loan), had never missed a payment or gone to collections, and had a FICO score that fluctuated between 780 and 815.  I had a lengthy credit history, and was able to get credit from anyone I wanted.  Unfortunately, when the seed money for the new business (which my partner had assured me was in the bag) didn't materialize, instead of cutting and running, I accepted his assurances that the money was still coming, and used my personal cards for company expenses, which were to be reimbursed as soon as the money came in.  Initially it was no big deal, because the cards were all on 0% promos and the company was making the minimum payments.

Fast forward two years or so, and, needless to say, the seed money never came, and I'm still sitting on all that debt but at rates ranging from 17% to 29.99%.  The total amount is about $55,000, on six different cards (all at 70% - 90% of the credit limit), but, only about $40, 000 of which shows up on my credit report.  See below for more on that**.  In addition, the IRS has sent $2500 in unpaid 2015 personal taxes to collections.  I've downloaded my credit report to see if that has shown up, yet -- it has not -- but there is a $60 collection for a gas bill that didn't follow me when I moved a year ago.  My credit score is now 694.

So, here's what I've done, so far (mostly thanks to advice found here):

-- I've written a letter to the collections agent, requesting a pay to delete, which is technically illegal in California, as I understand it.  But if I read between the lines of their response, I think we're going to make that go away.  I'll be paying off the $60 today.

-- I have formally withdrawn from the company, so the bleeding has stopped, but I'm now unemployed and have had little success finding work that will allow me to pay all the debt and maintain a normal lifestyle.  (I live in the San Francisco area, where a tiny 1 BR apartment runs $2500 or more, but I'm moving into a free, but short-term, house-sitting arrangement at the end of this month.)  

-- Before I was aware of the collections, I used $15,000 in savings to pay off a credit card with the highest credit limit ($35,000) and the card with the 29.99% interest, which had only a small balance, on the assumption that a 0% balance transfer offer would then come through, which it always has, allowing me to consolidate most of the debt onto one card. Unfortunately -- presumably because of my lower credit rating and the $60 collection -- my credit card company is only offering balance transfers at normal interest rates, in this case 26%, which is higher than any of the cards that still have a balance.

Logically, I should file Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I've done all I can do at this point to avoid it, including draining my savings, and even becoming an Uber driver, which is worse than not working, I think, but I'm still actually hoping to pay all of this off instead for filing for bankruptcy.  I can hold out for another month or two before I won't be able to make the minimum card payments.

Here, then, are my questions:

-- Assuming that the $60 collection is paid today and subsequently deleted from my file, and given that I've now at least slightly improved my debt to credit ratio, how long will it likely take for my credit score to improve, and maybe even pop back up into the range where I might see 0%, or at least a lower than standard, balance transfer rate?

-- If I call the credit card companies to explain the situation and ask for leniency (i.e., reduced interest, permission to skip a few payments), will my credit score be affected, and can I expect my accounts to be flagged, canceled, credit limits reduced, etc.?  And, realistically, how much time will they give me if I request such leniency?

-- ** One of the cards is a corporate card from a business that I no longer work for.  (I know, I know . . . this is not good, but I just didn't want to open new accounts, and this one has a high limit, and doesn't show up on my credit report,  which is probably why my credit score is as high as it is, the foregoing notwithstanding.)  If I declare bankruptcy, will this card automatically show up at the time of the settlement, even though it does't appear on my credit report?  If so, is it safe to assume that the company I used to work for is going to be contacted?  I REALLY can't have that happen, since the business is owned by a family member with whom I already have a fractured, but improving, relationship.  As dumb as it is, I hope to continue to pay off that card from the mad stacks I'm earning with Uber, even after filing Chapter 7.

-- Assuming that business card WOULD end up being part of the settlement, I will probably use the balance transfer option from the card I just paid off to eliminate the company card balance before filing for bankruptcy.  Ethics of this aside, am I asking for trouble if I incur a big card balance right before filing?  And, if so, how far in advance of filing do I need to make that transfer to avoid such trouble?

-- Now that the IRS debt has gone to collections, can it be included in the Chapter 7 settlement, or is tax debt not applicable, at any time, regardless of who now owns it?  Alternatively, and with respect to the question just above this  one, can I pay off the IRS collection with a credit card before filing for Chapter 7 without raising a bunch of flags at the settlement hearing?

Well, if you've managed to get all the way through this I commend you, and thank you.  Again, your counsel is really, really appreciated.

Thank you!

personalfinance,Need more clarification on taking a Residential Loan from TSP (Federal Job),"I've been reading up about taking a residential loan from your TSP, and it says that I repay the interest at the rate of the G fund which is hovering around 2.85% to 3.15%. Does this mean it's more wise for me to max out my TSP as soon as possible? I plan on being employed by the feds soon and was debating whether I should just hoard cash to make a down payment for a condo, or use my TSP to shelter the money against some taxes and then use the principal as a loan, then pay it back. Would this make sense? I am not interested in stocks or the like.

I'm also confused as to how the loan repayment works. To my knowledge, the largest loan I can take out is $50,000, and the loan being paid back is towards the initial principal? What happens to the interest? Do I have to pay back this residential loan in 15 years? Would it be easier to build a real estate portfolio using this loan vs. going the traditional bank route? Can I take out a residential loan from the TSP AND take out a mortgage from a bank?

Now I am looking for a house but because my credit is not good enough to get a great rate (it is at 678), This issue with my mom has taken a toll on my finances as well as my marriage. My parents only pay the minimum but since these cards have a high interest rate, it does not pay off enough to effect anything. I have been very patient with my mother and have allowed her time to pay it off. She said she will pay it off by this coming February but is still paying the minimum and still has 7200 dollars to go. it is very tough on me, because these are the people who raised me and put food on the table for me and gave me a bed to sleep and etc. etc., however it is difficult to get my life kickstarted.

My wife and I have tried talking to both my parents about this but, it just ends up with my dad cursing me and my wife out along with my mom making me feel like I am the one is at fault since I keep bothering them about it. My wife is very stressed out about this and is effecting our marriage.

I have given my mom a year and a half to show progress in paying off the cards but has only paid 800 dollars within that time. Not to mention that she had a late payment last year which hasn't effected me much, but if she has one more late payment, my credit will take a good size hit. I just don't know what action to take.

personalfinance,Pay off student loans OR invest,"Hi all,

Here's my situation:

I'm 23

I make $700 dollars a week before taxes ($550 after)

I live at home and have few expenses

In August 2017 (right after graduating college), I had $32K in student loans. From then to around June 2018, I put all of my focus on those loans, and got them down to where I am now, at $16,500 with an average interest rate of roughly 3.75. My interest payments are tax deductible.

It was really important to me to get my student loans WAAAYYYY down from the huge number they were at, and I feel as if I've done that. Now I'm curious as to whether it'd be more beneficial to invest in index funds (with a 7% return) rather than put all of my money to my student loans (with an avg. 3.75% interest).

I'm a 27 year old female with no dependents. I've lived in the US for just over 1 year. I'm from the UK. I'm on an E2 visa. I have limited ties to the US. I live in Southern California.

My company has been under charging me for my taxes to the point where I'm going to owe at least 100k up to 150k. They didn't realize I had to pay FICA and Medicare because I'm on a visa - I've looked into this myself and found out it's not true for my E2 visa. I definitely should have paid FICA and Medicare... not just for 2018 but also 2017. I used a CPA for my 2017 tax returns and he didn't say anything about this at the time, in fact I actually got a tax refund for 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I have paid so far in 2018: Gross pay YTD: $700k\~ (this is 95% commission, 5% base salary) Deductions YTD: $18000\~ (401k) Taxes Paid: Federal: $140k\~ SIT:CA : $66k\~ SDI:CA: $2k\~ Total: $208k\~

Federal: $214k\~ SIT:CA : $67k\~ SDI:CA: $3k\~ Soc. Sec: $8k\~ Medicare: $10k\~ Add Medi: $4k\~ Total: $306k\~

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I owe about 100k. My company is not going to be able to get their shit together in time for the end of the year to correct the missing tax lines (Believe me - I know them) so by next month I'm going to have an additional 33% extra cash than I should have in my bank account. For the whole year I'm going to owe $130 roughly to the government. On top of that I am probably going to owe an additional $10k from 2017 from unpaid FICA/Soc Sec/Medicare.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no debt and 300k in cash savings that I was going to use to put down on a house. I'm pretty devastated that this isn't going to happen now... having said that I do realize how fortunate I am, so don't get me wrong. I realize that being conscious of this before the end of the year is pretty fortunate as I can make sure that I don’t overspend my next pay check.

&amp;#x200B;

As I see it, I guess I have these options: Pay it off all at once and put it down to experience Pay it off in bit (can I even do this?) Leave the US altogether and go back to the UK without paying it back. I know that’s kind of a shitty thing to do but man… It’s tempting… What are the repercussions for doing this? Also, if it matters, I would leave before the end of the tax year. I’m regarded as a ‘non-resident alien’ so I assume the IRS can’t come after me abroad.

Do I have any other options? What would you do in my situation? Also, are there going to be any penalties for this? I'm was just thinking, if everyone did this the government would be pretty fucked, so are there any penalties for paying under what you're obliged to pay to this extent?

Currently,  our interest rate is 5.25%.  Since we want to be out of the home within the next 4 to 5 years, it hasn't made sense to refinance.  Instead, we have been aggressively paying off our balance, and should have it completely paid in four years.  Our current balance is just under $98k.  

&amp;#x200B;

Our current plan is to wait until we pay our home off, before selling and purchasing our next home.  This has appealed to me since it would mean we could purchase the next home when we were ready, and wait to sell our current home whenever it would bring in a good price.  Possibly even renting it out for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

However, lately, our home has been feeling pretty small, and I am starting to wonder if we really need to wait.  Since our current interest rate is rather high, does it make more sense to go ahead and sell, to get into the next home at a lower interest rate sooner?",finance

personalfinance,When can I refinance my car?,"I'm in the process of rebuilding the mess of a credit situation young me got into, and I'm hoping I can lower my car payment so I can put that extra money towards getting caught up in other areas. 

I needed a new car badly earlier this spring, and I had no choice other than to take a stupid high interest rate (15%), for a stupid long term (60 months). I got a 2 year old certified pre-owned Jetta with a warranty that covers the term of the loan.

My payments are around $350 a month, which I can easily manage right now, but I'd like to lower my payment so I can get a little more breathing room, and so I can put that extra money to work.

I got the car 8 months ago through Capital One and have made every payment on time or early. 

Is 8 months too soon to start looking? Where all should I shop around? Would a refinance hurt my credit?

**EDIT:**Blue book on the car is about $12,500, amount owed is $13,200.",finance
personalfinance,Next year i have the ability to clear alot of debts and old bills up. Need some advice on how to prioritize.,"I will have the ability to clear some debts next year, and need some input on which ones should be cleared first. I owe 8k in credit cards, around 9k in medical bills, 13k between my wife and mines student loans, and some odd onesy twosys under $800.00. 
Im gunna be bringing in an extra 900.00 or so on top of my 2k+ plus salary monthly for about 10 months. I was thinking of clearing the credit cards up so if need be those can be reutilized in the event of emergency, and clearing the onesy twoseys after that. My interest rate's are mid to high on the cards, the student loans are still lower interest rates (under 5%), and i wanna at best keep those at monthly. 
My monthly bills come out to little over 2k monthly, and ill have little over 3k to play catch up with.
Im gunna be cutting rent and utilities, aswell so thats gunna be helpful in this process. 

Any input to pay those down safely and timely?",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan refinancing + 0% APR credit card for a year?,"So, I've been looking into refinancing my student loans to save a little cash over the longterm.

PSA: I've already looked into consolidation and it really doesn't help at all. I'm also not a teacher or a marine or anything special so I don't qualify for those perks either.

Now down to brass tacks:

I owe about 46,000 total in student loans - all USA government serviced.

About 21,000 is held in varying interest rates from 5.5%-7.25%. Everything else is in varying rates under 5.5%, which I consider to be pretty good so I figure I'll just leave those where they are.

Now I found a pretty good deal through a private lender to refinance that 21k at 5.2% over 10 years with 24 months available in forbearance along with additional benefits if I decide to go back to school. I'm not really planning on going back to school, but it's a nice ""what if"" benefit. I'm also planning on paying this off in about 5 years or less, but I'd rather pay ahead on my own accord than have a high mandatory payment (what if I get in a car accident and I have to rearrange funds to fix my vehicle? Etc.). There are also no drawbacks to paying ahead with this lender.

&amp;#x200B;

I was all set to move forward on that, but today I just got a letter from the company who is running my small dental loan (I needed a special splint made to the tune of 2,500 - sigh) letting me know that I have access to 19k at 0%APR for a year - of course the trick is, after that year is up the APR jumps to 26.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

So, should I just max out this credit line, ride it, throw a bunch of money at it and THEN just before the jump buy it out with my originally intended re-financing plan? Is there a downside to this? Is there something I'm missing?

&amp;#x200B;

My credit score is 790 if that matters - maybe in a year it could be above 800 &amp; I could qualify for extra sweet deals? IDK, just a thought.",finance
personalfinance,Perspective please: how bad is my debt?,"We are in our late 20s, combined income is just over 65k a year. I only work part time as we also have kids. 
We took a consolidation loan a year ago for 40k. Covered student loans (25k), 
home reno loans(7k), 
car loan (2k), 
credit card (6k). 
Principal is now down to 30,236.02

We are making payments of 450 every 2 weeks, so about 900/month (plus a few 3 payments months). Minimum payment is 317. Interest rate is 5.45% (works out to about 125/month). 
We were hit with a few months of almost no work over the summer and have put another 3k on credit again, and owe 4k in our chequing overdraft. 
So all in all right now we owe around $37,000. 

We are doing everything we can to get rid of it fast as it causes me huge stress to have this hanging over our heads. 
My questions are: is that number as high as I think it is? 
And
We are reasonably expecting several pay increases in the next 6 months which will allow us to budget even more to debt repayment (300-400 more/month). This will allow us to pay everything in about 2.5 years but pretty much do nothing else.
Is it worth it to stretch ourselves a little thin and pay 1200/month to get out of this fast? Or should we relax a little and chip at it more slowly? 

Update: Thanks ya'll. Sounds like our situation is as bad as I think it is. It's nice to know, even while it will be hard to dig ourselves out. We will be keeping our payments toward our consolidation loan the same, but as more money comes in, the extra 300-400 will go towards cc. I appreciate the feedback from everyone. And we'll definitely be learning Dave Ramsay.",finance
personalfinance,Emergency Fund in ROTH IRA?,"My question is pretty simple:

Is it a bad idea to have an emergency fund saved, but in a ROTH IRA? It seems to make sense for me, as I'll have a better interest rate by far than I would in a savings account, and there isn't a penalty for withdrawing any principal amount. It seems a little counter-intuitive for me to do so, but at the same time I don't see anything wrong with it. I've fallen on hard times in the past and been able to get money from the IRA within about 3 days, so it's pretty liquid.

personalfinance,A Company says I qualify for student loan discharge based on certain criteria that applies to me and my school. Is it legit?,"Sorry in advance for the novel. TL;DR at the bottom. 

Hi all (mods let me know if this is the wrong sub and I will move my post :))

So today I saw an ad on Facebook ft. my school. Normally I wouldn’t pay it any mind but this one wasn’t advertising the school, it was advertising this:

“Great news for anyone who attended this school. Virtually all student loans taken out to pay for courses and degree programs at some of the eligible campuses or their affiliated schools are being forgiven by the federal government, via the recently announced Student Loan Discharge Program. To see if you qualify, call XXX-XXX-XXXX or submit your info below.”

EDIT: the ad has a picture of the front of my school and the headline said something like “attention [name of school] students...”

So at first I think this is a scam and too good to be true so I scroll past it. But then I think, “Facebook has been cracking down on the content they show. What if it’s not a scam? The worst thing that can happen is that I can call, and figure out it’s a scam or just not worth it.”

So I call and end up having a 2hr conversation with the rep. I asked plenty of questions and made sure to be thorough to the best of my abilities. I don’t wanna be no sucka. 

What I found out is that this is basically an H&amp;R Block. Except, instead of doing your taxes they submit your paperwork to the government for your discharge and represent you if they think they can get the discharge approved. 

I qualified for the discharge because my school is a “for-profit” and the fact that they didn’t accurately represent the wages I would get when they graduate (I am skirting by as a receptionist at a company in my industry, so my foot is in the door. I did tell the rep that), they pushed me into a loan (my school recruiter was very aggressive, and didn’t help me to find other options. This recruiter was also let go before I got to school which may or may not be related.)

Here’s the summary from my call with the rep:
- Based on how I answered their qualification questions I qualify for the recently announced Student Loan Discharge Program. 
    - Here's some info straight from the government on student loan forgiveness, cancellation, and discharge : https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation
    - Here's some info on student loan discharge specifically: https://studentloanhero.com/featured/student-loan-discharge-programs/
    - I qualify based on number 6 on the previous link because my school is a for-profit school and mainly the way they handled student loan education.
- I have roughly $15k in federal student loans
- Based on my loan amount they're able to get me set up for the Student Loan Discharge Program (which will forgive my total loan amount) for either:
    - 1 payment of $750 (payment is really $899 but I get $150 off if I pay in full)
    - 2 payments of $449.50 (if I pay the second payment before December 15th it will only be $300. They're giving me the same discount I would get if I paid in full)
    - They are very clear that this payment is for processing and filing the documents to the federal government for me (like H&amp;R Block but with student loans instead of taxes). Why should I have them do it vs me doing it? Well because I've never filled out this paperwork, I could very easily make a mistake and make myself ineligible for the loan discharge. It's the same reason you have a CPA do your taxes, to ensure they are done correctly.
    - If, for some reason, I don't qualify for the Student Loan Discharge Program then they will enroll me in a program to minimize my monthly payment amount on the loan.
- The rep assured me that they've had cases that won just like mine (other students from my school, this the targeted advertisement) and if I submit I will my student loan discharge will be accepted. Current payments are $280ish, the program would bring me down into the $60-$100 range. 
- Apparently there are only so many funds/spots allocated for each school so this is somewhat time-sensitive.
- The only thing I have to do to guarantee everything processing in my favor is to answer 35 questions they send me as throughly as I can and the same way I told the rep. 
     - He said more people who don’t end up getting the discharge didn’t put enough info in the answer I.e. putting just “yes” instead of spelling out their experience like the form asks. 
- It takes 1yr for the paperwork to process on the Federal Governments end. Until then my account will be frozen. I will not waste any of my remaining forbearance and I will not be required to make payments on the loan.

One thing I thought was fishy is that I have to pay 3 days after signing the contract and not after I get confirmed for the displacement. Though i could also understand why it would be too I suppose..

I think this company does what it says and as long as I make it clear about my experience on dealing with the school I will be accepted into the Student Loan Discharge Program and my $15k in debt will go away, but I’m afraid of being bamboozled. 

I should also add that while we were on the phone call he was able to look up the info on my student loans with pretty easily so that was also pretty convincing. 

So what do y’all think? Is this a good deal? Is it a scam? Should I do it? I can make the payments,and $15k vs $900 is a no brainer, but it definitely sounds too good to be true. You all have any knowledge on this? Is this company tryna scam me?

If I can name the business and put up a link I will, so let me know. Or maybe pm me if super interested. 

To be clear, I really liked my school. It was a great time and I learned a lot. I don’t harbor any ill will against them. I answered the reps question leaning in the schools favor and being forgiving and I still qualified. I know this might hurt them and I know that I’m responsible for the debt (with some prodding with an aggressive recruiter), but I’m drowning in it. 
Edit 2: I will say that there are a large number of people who attend my school and don't succeed and I know a lot of people who basically took a $20k loan for no reason in the end. I'm somewhat successful but that's mostly to my own doing rather than any help from my school.

TL;DR
I found a company that says I qualify for the recently announced Student Loan Discharge program because my school is a for-profit school and mainly the way they handled student loan education. I can pay this company a fraction of my loan so that they will properly submit the paperwork and represent me to get my federal student loans discharged. Can I trust this company or are they tryna scam me?",finance
personalfinance,How should I handle my money when abroad in the Peace Corps for 2+ years?,"I don’t have much at all (less than 10K with more student debt than savings by about 15k ) as I’m just a college kid. My parents are going to pay my private loan’s monthly minimum (it’s a 5k loan) and I’ll defer my federal loans until I’m done my service. I’ve got 2 credit cards with 0 debt on those that I use for almost all of my purchases to build credit (at around 750 score right now).

My plan was to move my savings to somewhere high interest like Ally and put a small recurring charity donation (like $5 each month) on both of my cards. I’d give my sister (who I trust more than anyone) access to my accounts so she can ensure everything is going fine, but I’d set up autopay on the cards as well. I should have Internet access myself enough to check in too. I will bring one of my cards over with me as well.

I think I want to insure any tech I bring over (laptop, phone, etc) but I’ve got no clue how. Do I need to sign over power of attorney to anyone? 

What other bases do I need to cover here? I’d be in a rural East Asian country for just over 2 years and I’ve got no clue what to do money wise.

Also, I get 8k pre-tax upon finishing service plus the value of my plane ticket home. I wanted to use that in part to travel (cheaply) in Asia afterwards as I’ve never been before. Is that silly? Should i just roll that into paying off student debt? I was thinking it’d be easy and awesome to do really cheap solo travel while already in Asia without spending all of my pay, but i dunno. I wanted to set up to reward myself afterwards but I don’t wanna make any bad choices

personalfinance,Not sure what my best investment options are (college student saving for law school),"Hi everyone,

Just for some quick background; I'm a senior in college, and am planning on taking a year off after graduating, before then beginning law school. Ideally, I won't break the bank to attend law school, but seeing as pretty much every law school I've looked at is really expensive (go figure), that doesn't seem like a feasible goal.

Moving on to my question; I recently received some money that my grandparents had set aside for me (about $3,000), and was curious as to what my best options would be, with regards to investing this money? Part of me thinks a short term-type investment would be ideal, as I'll probably need some of that money to pay for law school; however, on the other hand, I don't want to invest it in something short-term, high-risk.

It's also probably worth noting that I do have some loans already at this point (about $12k worth). They don't have excessively high interest rates since they're federal subsidized loans, but after reading around a bit, one piece of advice was to pay off any loans before investing, so I'm not sure if I should do that instead? I'm pretty lost with what I should do here.

I was curious if anyone else was ever in a (relatively) similar situation, and could offer any guidance on what would be my best option here? Thanks in advance for any responses!",finance

personalfinance,"Should I try to pay for a house in cash, or is this a really bad use of money?","My [24M] wife [23F] and I are just getting started with our careers, and we almost have all of our debt paid off. Our credit scores are great, and we could live off of my salary alone fine, but she will probably be making more than me starting in two years once she finishes law school and gets a job. We are both pretty risk averse, and I’ve always been leery of the way Americans buy a $400k house for a 30-year mortgage (pronounced “debt”) and then end up paying much more for that house over that time period. 

So, we have been talking about staying in our apartment for a couple years longer than originally planned and trying to buy a house... in cash. Even if not the whole thing, maybe putting like 60% down or more, and trying to have it paid off within four or five years. To me, it’s about cash flow and getting things paid off as quickly as possible so that if something were to happen to one of us (disability or illness, lose our job, etc), we wouldn’t be screwed and living in a bigger house than we can afford. I’m big on not having debt - it terrifies me.

I told my friends about it and they thought it was a very dumb idea. They said I should put 20% down or so - however much is needed to get the lowest interest rates possible - and then invest the rest. They said I would get better returns through investing, and it hedges against the risk of your house burns down or property values plummet. I get that, but a) isn’t that what insurance is for, and b) the beauty of owning a house outright is that if the property values plummet and the economy tanks... we wouldn’t really care because we own that house. To me it still makes sense to try to buy a house in cash even if it isn’t the best “investment” decision.

personalfinance,"Annual elections are due at my work, wondering if FSA will be worth it for childcare expenses.","Hello,

My wife and I both work full time in Nebraska and will have 4 children during the 2019 calendar year, 3 of which will be in daycare.  Due to my flexible work schedule, and the fact that my wife will be on a 3 months partially unpaid leave starting in January for the birth of our 4th child I believe we will only incur about $11,000 in daycare costs next year.

Normally we would gross ~$110,000 (60k for my wife, 50k for me), but I'm expecting us to be a little under $100,000 next year due to my wife's leave.  Both of us are maxing out our HSA contributions, $10,500 total.  I'm contributing 25% of my own pay to 401k ($12,500).  My wife contributes 11% to her 401k ($6,600).

I'm not sure I completely get the way retirement contributions and deductions affect your tax bracket, but my understanding is:

$100,000  Gross Income

($10,500)  HSA Contributions

($19,100)  401k contributions

($24,000) Standard decuction

=

$46,400 AGI

That put my top tax bracket at 12%

My question now is whether contributing to FSA is worth it?  I read somewhere online that FSA is almost always worth it, but the 20% tax credit seems like it would save me more than the 12% federal/5% state rate.  Please let me know if I'm missing anything, and also if one is better than the other how much I'd save.  Getting reimbursed for childcare expenses through my company's FSA was a giant pain the butt in the past, so if it's really close I'd rather just not do it.",finance
personalfinance,Personal loans with interest below 6% for someone with excellent credit?,"Hey folks,

Asking for some advice for my partner. She is generally very good with money but feels overwhelmed by her remaining student debt at the moment. Her outstanding balance is $8376 with a monthly interest rate of 6%. She has been paying $250 every month on Autopay which is mostly going towards the interest. Her savings account is pretty much empty because she used it to pay off the rest of her student loan before the interest kicked in. She has recently started a new job where she's paid $1267 twice a month. Her monthly expenditure on all utilities and groceries is about $1250. I have suggested that she save one paycheck for all her expenses, and put about $900 of the second paycheck towards the loan so she has about $370 left for savings/fun money (I can cover emergencies with my savings). Does this seem wise? I'm not very experienced as my home country doesn't require me to start repaying my student debt until I'm earning significantly more and I've never had any other debts.

My main question: She would like to take out a personal loan with a lower interest rate to pay off the student debt and then make repayments to that instead. However, I've struggled to find any personal loans with a lower rate than 6%. Her credit is over 800. Any suggestions?

stocks,Morning Technical Newsletter-Hopeful Brexit News Lifts Pound,"#### Hopeful Brexit News Lifts Pound

News that a Brexit deal, albeit still in draft form, was struck between the British government and the European Union was enough to provide a lift for the Pound Sterling. That news improved risk sentiment and gave investors the confidence to buy the Pound. Analysts offer a word of caution, however, and point out that this draft deal still needs to get approval from the British Parliament and that the Prime Minister may need to use all her powers of persuasion to receive the Parliamentarians’ blessing. Members of Parliament will be meeting tomorrow to discuss the merits of the draft.

As reported at 11:11 am (JST) in Tokyo, the GBP/USD was trading at $1.30, down 0.12% and moving away from the earlier high of $1.3036. The EUR/GBP is trading up 0.22% at 0.8688 Pence; the pair has ranged from 0.86674 Pence to 0.8710 Pence.

#### Dollar Outlook Improves

The US Dollar is coming under some pressure as well from the improvement in risk sentiment. Currency strategists expect that pressure to be short-lived given the outlook for the US economy, coupled with the Federal Reserve’s anticipated December rate increase. It’s position as a safe haven currency, especially relative to a weakening Japanese Yen, is also providing appeal to the greenback. The EUR/USD is currently trading at $1.13, up 0.13%, and off the session high of $1.13218.

personalfinance,Keeping car in my name to build credit vs. putting it in my dad's to refinance for better rate?,"Hello, any input here would be much appreciated and helpful. 

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I have 2 credit cards currently. But I only really use one of them and keep a balance of about \~$2000-$3000 but never miss payments.

I purchased my first car in May, with my dad as primary and me as the co-signer because my credit wasn't very established and did better with him being the primary. The loan was for $\~18,000 with a 5.8% interest over 72 months. Not great but I was okay with it.

I have been making all of the payments on the car and it's been helping build my credit. 

My dad wants to refinance the car to get a better rate of 3.3%, the only thing is he would have to drop me from the loan to receive that rate. I would still be responsible for paying for the vehicle. 

**Question: is it better to refi, drop my name and save \~$1,100 over the course of the loan. OR Keep me as the co-signer and keep the 5.8% interest rate on the loan to build my credit?**

In addition to my contribution, my SO would match the amount. I average around 35K USD pre-tax per month (self-employed) and my SO makes less than 9K USD per month and expect this not to fluctuate dramatically for the next year. Considering the market, but also the increasing interest rates in the US, what price range of a home would be within reason? Based on other threads it seems like a mix between investing and home equity (not putting down all my cash money into a down payment) seems to be recommended which leads me to say that despite my SO's insistance, buying a 1 million USD apartment may not be be the best idea considering the known (above) financial situation - or is it worth considering? The apartment would be an investment purchase as we don't live in the US. Should we purchase something in the 500K range with debt and invest a portion of the cash into stocks?",finance

personalfinance,Tips for paying off student loans with lump sum payment?,"Hi everyone! I (36yo guy) have two packages of loans - one with Company A with \~$8k remaining balance, and one with Company B with \~$45k remaining balance. Each package of loans is made up of multiple smaller loans with interest rates ranging from the low 4%'s to the high 6%'s.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have, after a recent windfall, paid off virtually all other outstanding debts - my credit cards are zeroed out, my car is fully paid for, etc. After *years* of crushing debt, it's an astonishing feeling! After paying everything else off, I have enough cash left that I could pay both student loan companies off in full right now, although with basically nothing left over for ""safety net.""

&amp;#x200B;

While speaking with a local financial adviser yesterday, he suggested that I might try calling Company A and Company B, and basically ask to speak with anyone who can negotiate my current balances. His thought was that I could basically say something like, ""Hey Company A: I have some cash right now to put towards my debts, and I'd like to pay you guys and be done. Would you take $5,000 and consider my loan paid in full?"" Obviously, they may flatly reject this idea, or may come back with a counter-offer of their own.

&amp;#x200B;

Have any of you guys done this? I'm in good standing with both loan companies and my monthly payments are made on time - does that actually hurt me here, since they may prefer to just keep me paying my balance + interest in the long run? Is this an idea that anyone else has executed successfully without being in default?

personalfinance,Quick primer on annuities (for people new to the topic),"Hey ya'll, I realize that some people may be confused about what certain savings vehicles are or how they work. Mainly annuities. 


Annuities are a vehicle for money management, this is a basic primer, not a comment on whether they are good or bad. My goal is to help those unfamiliar. 


You can divide the subsections of annuities into two sections, the accrual period, and the payout period.  


Generally speaking the function of the accrual (accumulation) period is done in one of two ways, over time, or by purchasing a paid up annuity. 


**Annuities with an accumulation phase** have a time period at the start of them where you can basically feed money into the account like a savings account. The upside of annuities can be higher interest rates guaranteed than savings accounts, the downside can be that it is very very very hard to get your money out(other than specified payments), or high fees or, well a lot. 


A paid up annuity is something you may only encounter in your lifetime if someone you know and are the beneficiary to has a life insurance account or an annuity themselves, or if you are particularly wealthy and look into creative ways to structure your money.  Or maybe, you just won the mega millions. 


**A paid up annuity** is where you give a company a specific sum of money and they begin to pay it back to you in the specified function.  


Accumulation phase based annuities have complicated structures designed to help you maximize the payments on the other end, and have far more detail to them than i can put here. suffice to say that these are the two types of annuity accrual you will most commonly encounter. 



The money in an annuity generally bears interest the entire time, whether it is paid up or accrued. but depending on the second part of the annuity this doesn't necessarily matter. 


People who may be familiar with an annuity might think they return your principle at the end, in fact this is a common sales technique because technically they **CAN** return your principle **Over a period of time** in fact, many annuity's have a guaranteed return of principle payment structure like an annuity with **payment period certain** if you structure your payments that way you could get the entire account balance paid out over a very short period if you like, but this is cheats the main benefit of the annuity which is guaranteed income from a source of savings. 


The highest payment, and potential for most money returned will always be a **Simple Lifetime Payout** because the company is gambling on you dying before they lose their profit.  Your goal with this is to become immortal, which would actually make this a fantastic deal.  The risk is you only get what you live for. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Regardless of how you have it an annuity's payout structure is generally paying out **X** amount per /m for **Y** years or until death/final death of beneficiaries in other words, you don't see your money back until **X times M = IS(initial sum invested)** so while you can make a fair amount on guaranteed interest, the reason the interest is so high is because the payout terms allow another company to hold onto your money for so long, and in **some** cases they **never return the full amount of your IS  let alone + interest.**


There are many important parts of the annuity to examine if you look at them as a savings vehicle, like whether you have uncapped contributions, what % of growth you get during the accrual period, and what the payout terms and amounts are.  There are other types of annuities that have tax sheltered growth, which is usually a compelling reason to sign up for them. Some companies base their entire business on selling tax sheltered annuities. 


Here's a good resource on how annuity payouts are structured: https://feelingfinancial.com/get-principal-back-annuity-depends/

personalfinance,Doomed by student loan debt,"Hi r/personalfinance! Apologies for the long post.

My boyfriend suggested that I ask you guys for help. A bit of background first: I was the youngest of six kids and a first generation college kid working two jobs whose parents had no money to help put them through college. Subsequently, I had to take out a lot of loans in order to graduate, some of which had to be taken out in my parents' names because the school would not offer the larger loans to me. I recently graduated and am soon to start paying on these student loans. I have two separate bundles of loans: one in my name through the university and one in my parents' name through an outside party. 

The loans in my name total roughly $8,000 each with 5.00% APR while the loans in my parents' name are more complicated. There are a total of five loans with different totals and interest rates. 
1-  11,600        7.21% interest rate
2-  12,000        7.21 % interest rate
3-  17,500        6.84% interest rate
4-  26,000        6.31% interest rate
5-  38,000        7.00% interest rate

I was told these loans could be paid back in one of three ways: $1,400 every month for 10 years, $850 for 25 years, or a gradient scale starting at $700 and gradually increasing every few years. These plans do not include the $8,000 in my name which is not due for a few more months.

I currently pay around $700 for rent and utilities every month, maybe $40 for gas to get to and from work in a month, about $250 on groceries a month, and $50 for car insurance. I make just short of $2,000 every month and have about $5,000 currently saved.  I don't know if I should use my savings to pay off as much of the loans in my parents' name as possible or if I should just resign myself to paying on these loans for 25 years. I don't feel like I have the money available to do any of the payment options. My boyfriend once mentioned refinancing my loans but I don't know if that is a good option for me. I still feel like I am living a modest lifestyle and try not to spend money on unnecessary things. Am I doomed to be paying on my student loans forever? What would be the best way to approach this situation so that I can maximize on paying off my loans quickly and efficiently without dooming myself in the process?",finance

gaming,"Long rant about the God of War series, and it's worst enemy design: the Wraith","As you all know, God of War is the pinnacle of Action games back in mid PS2 era alongside Devil May Cry. It had a wondrous design, colorful world, gritty and angry protagonist and combat that, despite being reused at least 8 times along with it's enemy types, never seems to get stale to look at or stop being entertaining. But today, i'm going to talk about THE bane of my existence playing these kinds of games, and the situations and major problems these enemies bring to light about the games' design. These enemies are the Wraiths.

Wraiths (in their more common design) are these morphic creatures with pendulum like weapons that can sink into the ground and attack from below. In God of War 2, these pendulums can be thrown like a boomerang, stunning Kratos with multiple hits. When sunk in, Wraiths cannot be harmed or dealt with until they rise to attack.

You probably already see the problems i have with these enemies, especially with how many the games can pit you up against at a time. God of War 2 has these enemies commonly attacking at the same time, stunlocking Kratos and leaving him open to so much damage it's ridiculous, and with the camera being unable to be manually controlled, these enemies are able to disable defense and offense at once from off screen, forcing you to have to habitually dodge or risk being blindsided. Aside from that, these enemies pose no sound cues for what they do, and they can leave almost no room for error due to how they fight. The second you're caught when they rise from the ground, you are locked into a combo and disabled for almost a whole second. 

The Ghost of Sparta variant, the Keres wraith, can attack almost without warning, much like the original Wraith, but these don't even have to get remotely close to you to deal damage. They dig their claws into the earth and impale from below, stunning you for (yep) almost whole second. When ""downed"" by heavy attacks, a Searing Core, or other means, they dig themselves into the earth and pounce you from another direction, proceeding to rabidly claw at your face until you do the QTE to kick them off. These enemies designs pose major issues for the game that are partially fixed in God of War 3 with it's plethora of options you start with in the game, but even Ghost of Sparta suffers the horrible imbalance between it's own imbalance and these enemies, despite starting you with similarities to 3's arsenal.

You might try to tell me that these enemies are not as hard as i'm making them out to be, and you're right. They aren't difficult. They're unfair.

Enemies designed to attack like these do shouldn't have attacks without warning, especially with the stunlocking capability they have across the games. This coupled with the fact they attack off screen and even while other enemies are attacking together brings to light the lack of balance for Kratos in regards to his enemies. He's a brute, he's savage. It's been shown he has amazing feats of strength despite his enemies and their abilities. He's killed Titans, Gods, and many other mythical beasts. He should not, plot wise, be stunned by such an enemy, at least not for so long and to the point he's kneeling on the ground. His enemies are numerous and fast, and especially in earlier games, he has very few working defensive options. He cannot cancel attack combos when he needs to defend, which is a major issue when put against such enemies that can't be phased by attacks, have no sound cues for attacks and only a slight visual tell for their attacks. You can only effectively attack 1-2 enemies at a time. If one enemy is not in Kratos' ""line"" of attack, they're in a blind spot usually. Most players won't focus on them, and because of this, blindsides occur. One blindside attack can turn into an almost relentless onslaught of attacks that cannot be evaded or blocked until you've lost more health than you can deal with. This is not a good design for any action game, and it's especially sad to see these enemies are present even in the PSP titles, which are almost as old as the two PS3 games. Even in my limited God of War experience, i think enemies such as these are a balance decision for the game that should have been better looked at, and these enemies are the only reason i can ever hate God of War alongside Satyres. Those two enemies, more than anything, should not have been as horrendously designed as they were in any of the God of War games, especially given Kratos' limited options for dealing with such enemies, and the Wraiths, as redundant as it sounds, are a major offender of the static camera angling these games have. 

I'm not hating on God of War, i love the series. I love the world design and the plot. I just detest enemies that are made so specifically to counter the worst in a playable character to the point they're more rage inducing to fight against than difficult. They counter the one thing Kratos lacks in his gameplay, mobility, and proper cancelation. They are fast, barely predictable enemies that could have been made better. They don't need to be slowed down, they don't even need to be nerfed at all. An audio cue and a slightly more visible animation cue would be perfectly fine, as well as the removal of such a horrendous stunlock against Kratos. A whole second is too long for something like that, and especially suffering entire combos that not only leaves you vulnerable for the duration, but also for a second after, is just more annoying than some players know.

Rant ended.

personalfinance,Do I buy a house/get a roommate or keep my rental?,"My husband and I live in San Diego and have been looking for a house (and failing due to competing with other buyers who oftentimes offer $40-50k over ask). We finally gave up on dreams for a house and decided to pursue parenthood instead.

Now I am 5 months pregnant and we found a house that fits all of our needs for the next 10-15 years or more. There are a few considerations:

- the house has been listed for the last 120 days, and the price has been reduced from $600k to $550k. We offered $500k “as is” and the owner declined. The owner is now willing to sell to us for $515k (this is 39 day after our initial offer).

- the housing market is finally cooling somewhat due to rising interest rates, so it prices may be lower if we wait until 2020

- the monthly mortgage at that price with $35k down and $15k closing is $3500 a month, our current rent is $1995.

- we can only afford it if we have a roommate for $800-1000 a month. This is not desired but potentially would only be needed for 2 years. There is an attic that runs the full length of the house and my brother (who is a general contractor) can finish the attic with a 2nd bathroom, flooring, drywall etc for $10k. 

- we would be walking into potentially $40-50k or equity and could refinance to remove PMI 6 months- 1 year from now, which would reduce payments to $3k a month.

- the house is historic and would qualify for a Mills Act property tax reduction - reducing monthly payments to $2600 (would kick in 2020 at earliest).

- there is currently a detached garage that can be converted to a granny flat eventually, so there is still opportunity for future rental income without having a roommate inside the house. 

Cons:

- housing market is just post-peak and softening due to rising interest rates- there is potential for recession in 2019/2020 which could reduce housing prices (on the other hand, San Diego has scarce land and building is only at 3k new units a year, far less than demand so there could still be a strong housing market here despite a recession).

- living with roommate for potentially 2 years when we’re expecting our first child in 4 months (and have no idea what to expect)

- much more expensive mortgage payment which would be difficult to swing if one of us loses a job

- between $50k for down/closing and $10k for attic reno, we’d be spending down all of our savings (but could build it back up over time)

Pro’s:

- could finally own a house and work on building equity
- eventually mortgage would be comparable to market rate rental
- space to grow family eventually
- House is historic (wish list) and in a great neighborhood with transit, close to parks, grocery in a really trendy neighborhood

personalfinance,"With interest rates on the rise, is paying PMI actually OK?","I've always heard that if you can avoid paying PMI then you should, and it makes sense: Why throw that money away when you can save up for a larger down payment instead? Sounds reasonable to me. However, interest rates have risen significantly recently, and will continue to rise in the near future. With that in mind, is paying PMI necessarily a bad thing?

Here's an example (calculations from mortgagecalculator.org)

**Case A:** I buy a $200,000 house today. 30 year fixed mortgage at 5% APR, with 5% down. For this example, I've set PMI to 1%, insurance to $1k/yr, property tax to $2000/yr, and no HOA. 

Total paid over the life of the loan, including down payment: **$483,810.99**

**Case B:** I rent a cheap apartment for a year to save up some money, and buy the same $200,000 house with a 20% downpayment. In that year, interest rates have risen to 6%. PMI, insurance, HOA, and taxes I'll keep the same as Case A.

Total paid over the life of the loan, including down payment: **$475,341.10**

Over 30 years, the difference you pay is around $8500-- essentially a wash, and probably less than what you paid in rent to save up that down payment.

Am I missing something, or is it OK to have a small down payment and fork over the PMI?",finance
personalfinance,Brokerage CD (2.8% yield) vs savings account (1.9% yield)? Which one?,"I'm trying to debate between two options and I'm curious if you guys have some insight on why I should go one way or the other.  

Option 1: Charles Schwab brokerage CD (1yr is 2.8% yield). 
 
Option 2: Ally savings account (1.9% yield).

I'm age 35.  I'll have 20k set aside for emergency money (I guess this should technically go into the Ally savings account).  Then I have a portfolio of roughly 70% stock and 30% extra cash.  I want to put that 30% extra cash into a safe investment because in maybe two years from now, I'd like to buy a house.

It seems to make more sense to put that extra cash into the high yield brokerage CD that is FDIC insured up 250k.  From what I understand, if I need to get out of the brokerage CD early to buy my dream house, I can sell it on the market.  I imagine I wouldn't loose much...unless interest rates goes up a large amount.  So if interest rates went up by 1%, I'm guessing I would loose 1% and pay a brokerage fee of $1/$1000 of CDs.  Is this right?  The loss is equal to the increase in interest rates, right?  In this example, loosing 1% isn't a big deal to me if I already gained 2.8% from a previous year's CD.


Ally saving account is nice because I don't have to manage it.  I just put money in and let it sit.  I can access the money easily, although I can't imagine why I'd need to access it early other than buying a house.  I would only get a 1.9% return, which is almost 1% less than buying a brokerage CD.


Am I missing anything?  Why do people prefer a high yield savings account over a brokerage CD?  They are both liquid except brokerage CD can come at a loss (considering it seems likely that interest rates will go up in the future).  But this loss can be offset just by holding the money in the CD for 1 year.  More likely than not, I will net more by going with CDs.  Honestly though, I have never sold a brokeraged CD before so I don't know first hand the penalties and losses I would take from doing so.",finance

personalfinance,A mistake yielded double my planned realized losses from investment. Do I build a house now or stay with my original plan?,"I have a house/mortgage/rental/investment/savings kind of question. It's not exactly a question yet, but I bet I'll figure those out as I type some more. I'm sure it is one that you fine people are used to, but I find when I read existing responses they don't necessarily jive with my situation. Then again, it could be that my mind is stuck in a particular thought process and it won't allow previous advice and information to help in the way that it really can. So, I apologize for another one of these posts but I do hope to find what I'm looking for and maybe help out a future person. I'll try to be concise and not droll on and on and on and on and on and...

**Let's start with some background:**
 
- About 12 years ago we received a 350k inheritance. We interviewed and found a financial advisor we trust and who has good rates. This setup has worked well ever since.
- Almost immediately we paid off student loans and bought a new vehicle totaling about 50k.
- About 10 years ago we paid 82k for some land. This was a goodish deal at the time. Nowadays, I have some buyers remorse based on price since we've had the land so long and have done little with it at this point.
- About 5 years ago I separated from the military and the job search did not pan out at as planned/hoped. This is the price I paid for location over high paying industry and one I felt locked into knowing my land would have a heck of a time selling. My pay started at 45k and has since risen to 70k base. The last 2 years I have made at least 80k due to OT and bonuses. 
- About 4.5 years ago we bought a townhouse that cost us 1k a month after mortgage, insurance, and tax. Buying this house we decided to arbitrarily shoot for 10 years until we would be able to build.
- About 1.5 years ago we made a financial plan for a house build 2 years in the future (summer 2019). This plan was for 50k of my income and 50k from the investments. We communicated this with our advisor and the process of realizing losses was started.
 - This plan included a HUGE MISTAKE! We did not account for an emergency fund, which I consider even more important when undertaking an expensive build. However, I did not discover this mistake until a couple months ago.
- About a year ago one of our vehicles was totaled by another driver. I fought for a high payout (the vehicle was paid off) and we bought a 2 year old vehicle for about 15k out of our bank account.
- A couple months ago I discovered my house plan mistake and redid the plan to include an emergency fund. The emergency fund was ""filled"" immediately from the house fund. This plan included 20k for emergency (we spend about 36k per year) and the same 50/50k as previously stated with a build date in the summer of 2021. I told our advisor about this but due to the market, losses were already realized and the cash was ready. BIG CHANGE: The cash available is 103k, not 50k. I had misspoke, or I explained wrong, or the advisor misunderstood. Either way, the full 100k was now in a cash account held by the advisor instead of 50k from investments and 50k from my income. **Lesson learned: Regardless of trust, mistakes happen, make sure all financial decisions get a 2 factor authentication between verbal and written!**
- NOTE: My wife's income is not considered at this time and has not been for 10 years. Her income is reinvested in her business until she can build a facility on our property, currently slated for summer 2021.

**My Conundrum:**

So, until I figure how I want to go forward, I have 103k being transferred to one of my bank accounts (FDIC insured), I have a 20k emergency fund, I have 13-14k in house funds saved, and I have 3k sitting in my checking account at all times for all normal monthly expenses (36k in spending per year to include everything). Transferring this money out drags the investment account down to 356k. Honestly, I am pretty happy with that number especially as I write this and see that we spent 132k inside of the first 2 years.

**My Plan:**

I'm not perfectly sure, I feel like my plan is shifting a lot in my mind. Very large money moves and purchases give me plenty of anxiety and I second guess and research to exhaustion. I've been reading on the sub and something that I keep seeing regarding this subject is 20% only, not going above the 20% down for multiple reasons (ex. house is not best investment vehicle, interest rates, extra premium payments, ROI over mortgage rate, etc.). Here are the ideas providing the framework to my plan:

- An emergency fund is an absolute must, preferably over 6 months expenses. This is covered.
- To build our forever home and have a mortgage/insurance/tax that doesn't exceed about 1400 per month (around 200k mortgage, 600/year insurance, 3000/year taxes). The idea was a 300k home with 100k down. With some of the plans we like, this could become a 350k if deemed affordable. We have some good ideas on how to limit the final price even with a larger/more expensive home.
- Not to allow the build temptation to let us lock in some future 7% or worse interest rate.
- Seriously consider renting the townhouse which was brand new when we bought it. With a fresh coat of paint and new carpet it will be brand new again. The townhouses in my neighborhood have not been great resellers since the developer sold everything but they do tend to rent well. Rentals in my area tend to go for 400-500 per bedroom. We have 4 bedrooms. The competitive rate would be at 1600/month to ensure affordability (prices are high because of the local college, but plenty of great renters can't afford 2000/month). I am handy and I know good quality, legit businesses that can handle what I can't for fair prices.
- Reclamation, out of business sales, lightly used commercial kitchen appliances, military discount on new, high quality ""backyard"" builders for custom cabinetry work....these are some of the things we are playing around with in our head to decrease the final bill. We have the means to buy these kinds of things ahead of time but have not bought anything yet. We also have the space to store quite a bit. There is also the option of not finishing some parts of the house or utilizing a plan with no attached garage. 
- I have a plan laid out for some bank bonuses and bank accounts at 2.25/2.75/3.33 APY (thank you Dr. Credit). All of these accounts are FDIC insured. This is interim stuff while we wait to build or to counteract the mortgage rate if we only pay 20% upfront.

**Questions:**

1. Do we build sooner with all this money or do we continue to wait as planned?
2. If we wait, I think the best thing is to reinvest 50k with our advisor and continue with the original 50/50k plan. Do you agree?
3. If we build now (next summer), do we only put 20% down, bank the rest of the money (income savings and investment cash), pay the mortgage not to exceed my $1400 affordable benchmark (based on my income), pay the rest of the mortgage with banked investment cash, and then also pay some extra principal with the investment cash? Or you know, some other plan that makes better sense.
4. Can you think of any extra information regarding townhouse rent v. sell that is not already readily available in this sub? I think this part is pretty well spelled out and my situation doesn't affect previously provided advice.

Honestly, reading back through this, I realize this all started with a mistake in realizing double the investment losses than originally planned and the seemingly insistent advice about sticking with 20% down and using the rest of the money in smarter ways. I'm starting to come back full circle and think I need to reinvest 50k and go back to the 50/50k plan. Still, I would love to hear the community's thoughts.

*I realize there may be some pertinent facts I missed to help with advice giving. We are in our early 30's. Our retirement accounts currently total about 95-100k. Our townhouse is mortgaged with a VA loan. After this new house, we do not and have never had any plans to use our investments for other purchases; the investment account will continue on essentially as a ""retirement account"" unless the unforeseeable happens. By the way, I do recognize it is not actually a retirement account but I won't shy away from your .02 if you think there are better ways to grow the money.*

**TL;DR:** A mistake was made, I wrote lots of stuff, thinking I talked my mind back into sanity, still curious if anyone has advice because me not smart enough to think of everything. Pertinent facts:

- Household income: Usable base income is 70k. Breakdown -- 95k base; minimum 105k last 2 years (OT &amp; bonuses); 25k of that is business income that is reinvesting until summer 2021.
- Liquid assets: 356k investments; 140k bank accounts (23k for emergency and monthly expenses)
- Townhouse value: Ballpark is 155-160k. We bought for 165k.
- Townhouse debt: 154k
- Other debt: None.
- Land value: 50k in today's market.
- Cost to build home: 300-350k
- Age: Early 30's

personalfinance,I am in desperate need of some financial help.,"TL:DR I have sunk myself in credit card debt, personal debt, and used credit cards for variable expenses such as food, gas ect. and need any advice possible to get out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout my life I was always taught to take care of my finances. My mother was extremely strict on her budget and naturally as I grew older I learned those same traits. Ever since I was legally allowed to work, I worked, and since then I haven't been without a job. I have always budgeted and always tracked my expenses down to a T, so much to the extent where I would record every transaction and category into an expense tracking app and monitor all of my credit cards, checking, and savings account. Up until now, I (21M) have lost control of my finances. I haven't changed my personal spending habits, however, my bills are just too much.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't make a lot of money. I dropped out of high school to get out of my parents toxic home. I do make above minimum wage, and I work in the banking industry. Nowadays it can just be so hard to live. My bills consist of the general rent, phone, electricity, internet, insurance, ect. but they are just so expensive. I want to say that I have around 15 bills each month that I have to pay. My bills tend to add up to around 75% of my income, and my bills aren't things that I don't need. I need a phone, a car, a roof over my head. I am not spending any money on anything that isn't a necessity.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where I have dug myself into this whole;

I have been using my credit cards (4 cards now) to pay for extra expenses like groceries, gas, and sometimes leisure items. Mainly variable expenses that are required to have. Each month, I could afford to pay them off in full. In August I got married, and my wife moved in with me. Her income goes towards our bills too, and it has been since before we were even married so I could ""officially"" live in my apartment. Since she has started living with me, the food bill, gas, grocery bill have all gone up. Now, I had accumulated some steep credit card debt that I needed to get out of before having to pay crazy interest rates. I ended up applying for a personal loan, payed off my credit cards, and had some left over to keep in the bank for a rainy day.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today and the extra money from the personal loan is gone, I have more credit card debt, and no actual cash money to my name. We are almost $2,000 in total credit card debt, about $4,500 in personal loan debt, we have 2 medical bills on the fridge that collections are calling about, her student loans are starting to email about payment, and we have about $200 in our savings account and $5 in our checking.

&amp;#x200B;

It's embarrassing to have to write this, especially since my whole financial life I have been extremely careful with my money. It is hard being an adult, and for me I have a lot of bills that have to get paid. If there is any advice at all i'll take it. I already know about the typical Dave Ramsey speech about the debt snowball and all, but that would require me to make more money and have enough left over to afford to pay more than the minimum on my credit cards and personal loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Income: Me: about $25,000/year

personalfinance,Dumb question about High Yield Savings,"I’ve been looking around at sticking our Emergency Fund into a HYSA. This is a true emergency fund and would only be touched if I lost my job (which I’m federal, so highly doubt it)
I was looking at Marcus Bank, Cit, &amp; Ally. When I’ve been doing research I found Ally bank has a zero penalty CD, which at $25,000 CD is 2.2% for their CD with no fees and no early withdrawal penalties. Their HYSA is 1.9%. 
Why wouldn’t someone just do that instead of a HYSA? I don’t plan to ever touch the money, I want something separate from my day to day accounts. So why do a HYSA when a no penalty CD can yield higher interest? Am I missing something?

Update: this is why I love reddit. Tons of great advice and tips. Honestly, liquidity isn’t a barrier I care about. I’ve had way too much money sitting in a crappy low yield savings account for longer than I want to admit. So once we move and have all of our financial ducks in a row I will set up everything then.

personalfinance,How does a work-study affect benefits like SNAP or state healthcare? (Wisconsin),"Hi, I am a full time student and I also have 2 part time jobs - one on campus and one off campus. I found out I am eligible for the federal work study grant. I'm wondering if it would make much of a difference for me to accept the grant, or should I continue just working my on-campus job as normal income.

Firstly, I recently fell just out of the bracket for eligibility for my state's healthcare/ SNAP benefits (by literally like 40$). If I accept my campus job as a work study, could I possibly be eligible for those again?

And also - I've been reading that a work study is taxable income for my taxes, but is not considered income for determining FAFSA aid, if I understand that right. So does that mean accepting the work study would result in a larger Pell grant than not accepting it? My annual income from both jobs is less than $12,000.

I emailed my school's financial aid office and was connected with a ""peer advisor"" who told me there are no benefits to the work study grant, some campus jobs just require it. I'm not sure if that was totally correct (based on my really poor understanding of stuff I've been Googling...)

hydro,Single-pot DWC re-circulation?,"Hi friends. I'm starting an indoor grow with a 50x90cm (floor area) tent and two IWS DWC pots with airstones. I'm not quite ready to add a res to the system, as this was my first indoor grow and I wanted to keep things fairly simple. 

I have some holiday travel coming up, and wanted to find a way to make sure the system can go 3-5 days safely without intervention. I have cats so I will have someone visiting who can help refill the pots if necessary, but I can't always be sure they will be close friends who I can trust to add nutes and pH the water. In general I'd like to not need assistance at all.

So my question is - would it be worth it to add a small pump to the bottom of the DWC pot and pump the water to the top of the net pot? This way if the water level drops too low, I can be assured the plat will be fed from above with water. 

I'm really only hoping to buy a few extra days of safety. This is my first DWC grow, and I have no idea of how long I can expect water levels to last, and whether or not this would be worthwhile. 

I tried a good search, but maybe my google-fu is weak right now. All the returns were for proper R-DWS systems with reservoirs.

personalfinance,Negotiating More Time Off Instead of Higher Pay?,"Not sure if this is the correct sub, if not, please suggest one that would be better suited.

I’m in a unique position where I can only make a certain amount of money per year (nothing over $64,000), otherwise I lose my federal retirement benefits.  

I served 10 years in the military and transitioned into a GS12 position 5 years ago.  I’ve been medically retired due to a mental health disorder and receive 40% of my salary per year (which is about $32,000) plus medical benefits where I pay my portion and the government pays theirs.  This is taxable income.

I graduated from a technical school where the starting pay is around my maximum ($64,000) that I can make per year while still receiving the federal medical retirement.  

It’s important that I still receive the federal medical retirement payment since it counts towards my actual retirement when I turn 62.  At that point I will have 42 years of federal service and be able to retire with 42% of my original GS12 salary plus my 401K savings and social security.  If I lose my medical retirement, I lose my retirement payment when I turn 62 and will just be getting social security plus my 401K savings.

My question is, how do I negotiate more paid time off instead of a higher wage?  How do I tell HR about my situation?  Should I even tell them?  Also, I will not be needing medical benefits either which will save the company money.  

TL:DR:  I can only make a certain amount per year, otherwise I lose my federal medical retirement.",finance

The beginning of 2018 marked the return of volatility after the tax cuts were passed, but through the summer the market didn’t react at all to sensationalist Trump-admin scandals, new rounds of tariffs, or geopolitical strife. 

But for some reason - seemingly out of nowhere - the last interest rate hike made the market hypersensitive to all of these things.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin or Property? What might be the best investment?,"We had a very interesting discussion over the weekend and people debated if it was better to invest in property or to invest in Bitcoin. The argument was as follows : 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Most people cannot afford to buy property, so they take a home loan at a Bank. The home loan is paid back with interest and some of these loans are spread out over 20 years to make it affordable to the person who takes out the loan. So, over that 20 years the house of $100 000 will cost you say $1 000 000. {$900 000 paid in interest} 

&amp;#x200B;

The argument is also that the property has to increase in value, with more than $900 000 for you to say that it was a good investment AND you have to sell that property to get that profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. The other side of the room said it was better to rent a smaller property and to invest the ""savings"" into something like Bitcoin, because your profit will pay for a bigger deposit or even a whole property in a few years time.

I’m trying to figure out if we should refinance the car, I’m not even sure what that really means honestly. But my problem is the payments are high but manageable, but we need another car. I should also note that our car insurance is almost they same cost as the car payment, we pay a little over 500$ a month for the car all together. 

My SO and I have no accidents or tickets, I’ve been told insuring a car in LA is super expensive and the company we are with is giving us the lowest rate out of all the companies I’ve called.

We wouldn’t mind buying a beater car, that’d be the simple cheap solution but the market for beater cars in our area is ridiculous. People ask for 5k for a 1996 Honda Civic with 200k miles on it. It’s nonsense and we are not that desperate. I rather put that 5k towards a down payment on a safe, reliable car. 

We do not plan on buying new. We can’t afford it, and buying a new car isn’t something I think we’ll ever do. 

My SO wants a truck unfortunately. The only thing that sucks about trucks is they’re expensive, even used. But I know that’s what he wants and long term it would helpful to have a vehicle that can haul things. 

We are hoping to move to WA state in a year or so, my SO is military. I know that car market there is much more reasonable than Louisiana is. So we could wait to buy till we get there, but it’s going to be tough. 

Anyways, if you were in our position what would you do? Refinance the car we have? Wait to buy in a different state? We’re both new to car payments, we owned beater cars prior to our move to LA.

personalfinance,401k or pay for grad school?,"Hey all, question that I don’t think is covered in the prime directive or any of the other very helpful documents here I’ve been using to get my finances together. I’m not looking for anyone to pick the 401k or grad school options for me, I’d just like to see the thought process you guys would use to make this decision.

2019 will be the first year I’ll be able to max contributions to my 401k, HSA, and potentially my IRA. My budget is still a work in progress (started tracking every penny this November) which is why the IRA is still a maybe. And if you’re wondering, yes I have an emergency fund at about 5 months of living expenses as a single person with no dependents.

2019 also happens to mark the year I want to start my MBA in the fall. I estimate that part time tuition will be between 6-8k per semester so about 16k a year to be safe. I’ll still be working full time and my personal budget for other expenses will likely stay the same once I’ve finalized it, though I’m sure I could squeeze some money here or there if I need it.

With 401k contributions being 19k for next year and tuition costing about 16k a year I’m wondering how I should determine if keeping my contributions maxed and taking a loan, or paying for school outright would be a better decision. For reference my 401k is about 60% Roth as I anticipate my tax bracket increasing in the future.

My initial thought process was to compare interest rates, but it’s tough to know the rate on a loan without actually applying. Discover seems to be the best option with no fees and a minimum fixed rate of 5.99%. My credit score is 780 and pretax income is 61k with potential for straight time overtime. 

Right now I think I would hate to miss out on the 401k contributions, but I’m also not sure if I can count on a high enough return to outweigh whatever interest rate I get on my loan. What are your thoughts?

Our lease ends in one month, so we have options to extend for any new term length, however, anything other than a 12 month lease will be between $300-700 month more expensive. Because of this we are considering jumping the gun and purchasing within a month or so before our lease ends.

**Are rising interest rates and continued home value appreciation enough of a reason to dip into our emergency fund to purchase now instead of 12 months from now?**  
We would be purchasing a home in December and would dip into our emergency fund to cover the down payment and closing costs which would leave us with a two month emergency fund. We would make it back to a fully funded 6 month emergency fund within 4-6 months. I'm struggling with understanding how much weight we should put on the increased interest rates, appreciation of home values and the value of the cash I would be putting towards equity vs throwing away on rent if we spend another year.   


**How much home can I afford?**

We plan to get married in the next two years and had planned to buy a home prior to getting married either way so this doesn't really affect our long term budget for the wedding. My main concern is that I have read/heard general rules of thumb that your home mortgage should not exceed 20% or 30% of your take home income. Living in Denver where the housing market is very high, it seems nearly impossible for us to find something that will allow us to have a reasonable commute to our jobs without hitting 27-33% of our take home income. In regards to the home price, the homes we are looking at are slightly higher due to their proximity to public transportation which we use for commuting to work. This allows us to own one car and gives us both an easier commute. While this may increase the price of the home we are purchasing, it allows us to avoid a car payment and I also expect this to attribute to a continued appreciation on the home value.

&amp;#x200B;

**How much do I save after buying a home?**

I know the general rule is to put aside 20% of your income to savings which we have been doing. Once we purchase a home and maintain our 6 month emergency fund we plan on putting 15% towards our 401(k). Aside from maintaining a 6 month emergency fund and creating funds to cash flow things like a wedding or new car, should I still be aiming to put away 20% of my income to savings or investments outside of those savings goals that I set?",finance
personalfinance,Buying a car and the dealership offered me a 60 month loan amortized over 84 months due to the the interest rate being half a percent lower.,"I don't know anything about this end of car buying.

retirement,29 years old with nothing in retirement and paranoid about not being able to retire.,"My girlfriend and I, both 29, are pretty much of the same mindset in that we're paranoid about our ability to retire. We want to retire at 60 (or earlier or at all possible, but we doubt it) but I have two more years of college left and have $30,000 in student loans (5% interest rounded up, all federal) and am expecting to finish up with $50,000 in debt. She has a 401K with a few grand saved, but my employer doesn't offer one. We want to pay this off asap but also to start dumping money into retirement but we don't know where to start.

We have about $1200 in disposable income right now with me just working 28 hours per week (anxiety disorder makes it difficult to do full-time college \*and\* work 40 hours) and am guaranteed to be working 40 hours per week once I'm out of college and between semesters. This will jump to around $1700 per month once I'm working 40 hours per week all year round. Would dumping money into the loans to pay them off in 4 years be the best move? Or would it be better to spread it out over the 10 years after graduation while investing whatever we can?",finance

personalfinance,Best Kind of Loan to Include Home Renovation and Down Payment on New Home,"Can anyone give me some advice on the best kind of loan to include $60,000 of renovations on my current home while putting an offer on a new home ($100,000 down)?

I'm planning on moving in April 2019 so I want to shop around now for a new home while renovating my current home.

I have approximately $100,000 in savings/checking.  My current home is fully paid for (no mortgage) and currently appraised at $300,000.  So I would need about $160,000 to both do renovations and put 20% down on a new home.

I checked with several lenders and they all suggest getting a Home Refinance Loan (~4.25% interest).  Only problem is the closing costs will be approximately $10,000.  The lenders all say that I could write most of that off on my taxes.  But even writing off a full $10,000 will not put me in a lower tax bracket so I don't have a warm fuzzy feeling about this.  I feel like as soon as I close on the loan, I'm automatically $10,000 in the whole.

My head is telling me that it would be better if I just wait another year to save up an additional $60,000 and buy a new house when I sell my current home that will be fully renovated at that time.  My heart is saying that home prices and interest rates will go up in another year in the area I'm looking at.  Also, I'll miss out on a good deal for a new home that I've already found that I really like.

Anyone have any advice on what would be the best financial decision for buying a new home while renovating and selling my current home?",finance
personalfinance,"100 grand in college debt, what to do?","In total, spanning federal and private, subsidized and unsubsidized, and about everything else but the kitchen sink, I will end up with around 100 grand in college debt at the end of undergraduate school, and I’m two years deep as we speak. I should add my income after college will be around 65 grand a year before taxes, given I will likely work for who I’m interning with after graduation.

I have a few questions about what to do after graduation, namely these:

1) Should I continue to rent or get a house with a cheap mortgage in order to accrue equity?

2) Is it best to pay on several loans at once to build credit and then refinance once I’ve built it, or is there another, better payment strategy?

3) Is it best to make that the financial priority and spend every penny on paying these loans or relax and enjoy my early 20s while I can?

However, it seems like these people spend more time complaining about the games than actually playing them. They just post a lit of posts that are borderline (or completely over the line) insulting to the devs of these games. Some about how the game is just incomplete and shouldn't have been released as is. Others are nasty messages about how certain things haven't been nerfed or others haven't been buffed etc. Some of the game breaking bugs are understandable though, such as crashes and whatnot but the people who make me irritated are those who are pissed at the devs because they haven't fixed everything the immediately after launch. Let them work people. It takes a bit of time sometimes to work out how the bug is happening and why. Then they have to fix it after they find the problem. There is no possible way for them to find all the glitches for every scenario before launch.

TL;DR
Let the devs do their jobs, insulting them wont make it happen any faster. Also, ""unfinished"" games generally still have more content than older ones. Please stop complaining so much and taking up my feed with your garbage",technology

investing,Cramer says CEOs are telling him off the record the economy has quickly cooled,"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/15/cramer-says-ceos-are-telling-him-off-the-record-the-economy-has-cooled.html

* * *

Company leaders across industries are telling Jim Cramer — off the record — that they're worried about a slowdown in the U.S. economy, Cramer said Thursday on CNBC.

""So many CEOs have told me about how quickly things have cooled,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""So many of them are baffled that we could find ourselves in this late-cycle dilemma that wasn't supposed to occur so soon.""

Cramer has been warning investors for weeks about a manmade slowdown in the U.S. economy, fueled by the two-pronged pressures of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes and the Trump administration's tariffs. Now, high-profile CEOs are worried about growth slowing so drastically that it could actually hurt the economy, he said.

""There are degrees of slowdowns that, nonetheless, can cause an awful lot of havoc and cost a lot of jobs, and that's what we're on the verge of here,"" he said. ""That's what the markets are saying. That's what the CEOs are worried about offline.""

The situation reminded Cramer of when, on the cusp of the 2008 financial crisis, his corporate sources confided in him that the Fed ""seemed to be out of touch ... with what was happening"" on Wall Street, he said. That led to his now-famous ""They know nothing!"" rant blasting the Fed for its lack of diligence.

""I was right,"" he said. ""I did my best and, at that time, I made a resolution. If I thought we would ever get back into one of these situations again, I promised myself I'd be vocal about what could go wrong, even if I knew it wouldn't be as serious as the Great Recession.""

Now, with market commentators warning about the U.S. economy being ""late"" in its cycle, meaning that another recession could be on the horizon, Cramer's getting vocal.

Weakness in Europe and Asia's economies isn't helping, he said, pegging the respective slowdowns to Brexit pressures and instability in the Italian government and China undergoing a mass slowdown tied to President Donald Trump's tariffs.

If the Fed and Trump stay the course on their policies, the weakness will feed into the stock market as it did on Thursday, the ""Mad Money"" host warned. The action in shares of Walmart, Home Depot and Macy's told the story, he said: all three companies recently reported strong quarters, but subsequently saw their stocks plummet on economic fears.

""This end-of-cycle logic raises its head everywhere,"" Cramer said. ""Everything was good, so good that it can't ever be better because we're at the end of the cycle. 'Late-cycle.' It's become almost circular reasoning. The stock can't go higher because it's the end of the cycle and it's the end of the cycle because the stock's down.""

That, combined with the chief executives' warnings, told Cramer that stocks can't possibly be safe while the bearish narrative about debilitating economic weakness reigns supreme.

""If the Fed changes course and says 'No more rate hikes ... next year unless the data gets more positive,' or if President Trump gets a trade deal with China or even does this kind of truce, then the end-of-cycle proponents may have to change their tune and the market can rocket higher,"" he said. ""Otherwise, though, rallies like today are going to be used to re-position portfolios because the bears have the late-cycle microphone and they just will not let go.""",finance

personalfinance,"Is It Better To Pay Off Student Loans Right Away, Or Save Your Equity and Pay Them Off Incrementally?","For reference, we are 26 and 25 years old and just got married. My wife and I are in a unique position. We have student loan debts of approximately $78k and we have enough in our savings to pay it all right now and still keep about $4k.

We have about $43k in a 401k.

My concern is that if we were to give up that equity (what we have saved) and pay it all off, we wouldn't be able to rebuild that amount for a very long time. I was only able to save that amount of money by living at home and being very money conscious, making smart decisions, etc.

I work in a sales role so my income fluctuates but based on our fixed income (her salary + mine), minus our monthly expenses, we have a minimum of about $2500 dollars each month to save or put somewhere. I say minimum because that number could go up depending on how I do at my job or if she works extra shifts (she is a nurse)

**Loan breakdown is as follows.**\-There is a private loan ($28k) with a variable interest rate which is currently 6.8%.-The remaining amount is distributed between un-subsidized and subsidized federal loans which total about $50k.-About $15k worth of the federal loans have an interest rate of 6.8%, and the rest vary between 3.4% to 4.4%,

When she was in high school, her father passed away suddenly and left her a fair amount of money from his estate. She has not touched it and is saving it “just in case,” but she has not talked to a financial advisor or anything so she doesn’t know exactly how much there is, what kind of account it’s in or how fast it’s growing. 

I am fortunate enough to not have any student loans, but I have heard so many horror stories about interest rates and the time it takes to pay them off that I have advised her that it would be in her best interest long term for her to pull out money from her dad’s estate to pay off these loans now so they don’t start growing larger, but she thinks she’s better off waiting and having the money on hand just in case.

I am strict about my credit, as strict as I can be. My score, until recently, was 745 and I've never missed or been late on any payment in my life. I am the only source of income we have and I make roughly $42k a year, but that goes up slightly each new year and hire anniversary. 

I have three children right now, two are from my fiances previous relationship, one is mine (3 yr, 2 yr, 1 yr). She's pregnant with my second and due sometime in the next three weeks (and then we're BOTH getting the ol' snippy snippy). This one was a mistake, we didn't intend on this happening, but the ""other"" option was something we couldn't bring ourselves to do.

The situation: We're out of seats in the car I have now and I have no other option but to get a different vehicle. Unfortunately for me, this means I am going to have to refinance negative equity with whatever I buy. even worse for me, I thought I'd only have roughly $3500 in negative equity, but after visiting a dealer last night it looks like it will be $5000. This obviously pushes the payments way up and makes an otherwise affordable vehicle a less than desirable deal for multiple reasons. 

We did find a vehicle and test drove it last night. It's listed at $10,700 and we really liked it. Before allowing them to run credit we spoke about how much I would get on my trade in, and they gave me a list of what the payments would be using an assumed credit score/ interest rate, different down payments, etc. It all came back much higher than we'd like and we really couldn't afford it. The one way I could afford it would be to use my credit card to put down $3000 and use a 6 or 7 year loan. I'm hesitant on that because that credit card is already fairly high. We used it for an emergency situation and put $3000 on it already (on top of what was there). I just paid that off but it didn't make it on my statement, so one of my scores took a hefty tumble (Transunion went down to 690). 

There is another vehicle at another dealership, from the same ""chain"", that is cheaper and we haven't looked at it yet. It is listed at $7800 and I'm almost certain I'll get the same amount on the trade in which means $5000 in negative equity. This would end up being more affordable, but adding $5000 to $7800, not including taxes, fees, registration, is nearly doubling the price of that vehicle. I wouldn't need to stab my credit in the heart with a huge down payment, but it's not a great deal. 

Obviously neither of these are desirable. I wouldn't in a million years be thinking of buying a vehicle right now with how much I still owe on the car I have now, but with a baby on the way my hand is forced. We've been actively looking for a car for months now but unable to find anything that made sense financially. Now that we are so close we're in desperation mode. 

Question: What is the best move long term, both from a monthly finance perspective but also a long term credit score perspective? I could go with the more reliable, nicer, more expensive car that will likely put my credit in the toilet for a while, or the cheaper vehicle that I nearly double the cost of but it likely doesn't hurt my score as badly and monthly payments are a little lower. 

We do plan on putting a huge wad of our taxes (all that child money) towards paying off a loan and lowering the credit card, which will help my score and free up some money monthly, but is that something I should be considering now? Also, we are supposed to be getting child support from the older two children's father, but that's been such a fight and they're searching for him and dealing with an uncooperative employer in another state, so I'm not sure if we should count on that for other expenses or not.

personalfinance,BOA RV Loan Interest Charge Question,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub. I'll move this if it is.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background info: We have an RV loan through BOA. We financed $65,000 with an interest rate of 5.75% in 2016. We are full time RVers due to the nature of my husband's job and his company pays 100% of the RV costs, including the loan. This allowed us to get the RV with nearly just 10% down (our only out of pocket cost) and it's fully paid for outside of our income. This is standard in his industry, so that will continue even if he changes jobs. If he retires, we will sell the RV and can afford to pay the difference between the loan amount and the value if it's negative.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is - why do the interest charges on my statements vary so much month to month? I expected this to work like a home loan where the amount applied to the interest each month decreases steadily over time. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Here are the last 12 months of interest charges:

Dec 17: $301.53

Jan: $280.70

Feb: $339.85

Mar: $289.28

Apr: $278.52

May: $327.29

Jun: $296.85

Jul: $305.93

Aug: $295.29

Sep: $294.48

Oct: $313.24

Nov: $292.93

&amp;#x200B;

The loan has a fixed interest rate and fixed payments. I've noticed the same thing happens on the car loan we also have with BOA, however that loan is significantly smaller with a lower interest rate, so the variance is only $1-$2 per month.

stocks,Pound Gets Some Relief from Battering,"#### Pound Gets Some Relief from Battering

The Pound Sterling finally took a break from the recent free fall but FX traders remain clearly anxious that Britain might wind up without a Brexit agreement on March 29, 2019. The slide, which began early on Thursday after the news of the resignation of two prominent members of Theresa May’s party, had refused to ebb until recently. The concern is that the departure of these two key players may be the tip of the iceberg and that more party members might be unwilling to work with Ms. May to push through her proposal. If the Prime Minister is unable to secure Parliamentary approval, Britain would be left without the benefit of a safety net. The challenge to Theresa May’s leadership, the prospect of a hard Brexit and the possibility of slowing economic growth have all conspired against the Pound.

As reported at 11:08 am (JST) in Tokyo, the GBP/USD was trading at $1.2789, up 0.12% and moving away from the earlier trough of $1.2761. The GBP/JPY was trading at 144.999 Yen, up 0.01%; the pair has ranged from 144.878 Yen to 145.326 Yen.

#### Mario Draghi and EU CPI in Focus

Looking to later today, markets will focus on the release of inflation data for the Eurozone. At present, the latest poll suggests that October’s CPI and Core CPI will be stagnant on a year-over-year basis for the period, at 2.2% and 1.1%, respectively. Before then, however, Mario Draghi, as the keynote speaker will be addressing the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt. Mr. Draghi will likely be discussing the pulling back of the quantitative easing efforts the ECB has embarked on over the past several years and the governing council’s outlook as regards inflation and interest rates.

personalfinance,Should I trade in my car?,"I currently am paying a 2012 Honda Civic EX, and I owe about $11,900. The car is worth a lot less than what I owe, so I've been thinking about trading it in, but as I have found, the only thing that might make economic sense is something that is an amazing deal, enough to eat the negative equity in this car which I estimate is about 6500 in negative equity. I am seeing some deals on 2018 Chevrolet Silverado's, and I see some that are MSRP of 48k, for about 30-33k. If I can truly get the truck for around that price, would it make sense to trade in the Civic? Would it eat up the negative equity and get me a fair deal, or will it not be worth it? I currently have the Civic financed through my credit union, at a 7.1% interest rate, and monthly payments of about $354. I pay about $160 on full coverage insurance on the Civic. I am 22 years old, so insurance is pretty tough, luckily my father allows me to be under his insurance, and just pay him what they charge him to have me under the policy.

So I guess some key things to note is,

2012 Honda Civic EX - 107500 miles

22 Years old, no accidents on record

Very limited on down payment money, maybe 2k at most to put down.

Credit Score according to Credit Karma is about 680 or 650 depending on if its Transunion or Equifax.

I see benefits to both, If I get a new truck, I wouldn't have to worry about my vehicle breaking down since it would come with all the warranties, I also know trucks retain their values better than a car. On the other hand, my car note would almost double in my estimates, along with insurance going up. Would I be better off trading in or should I just suck it up and pay off the current vehicle. Any advice would be appreciated.

personalfinance,Why are 7/1 and 10/1 ARM mortgages seen as a bad idea?,"My partner and I are planning to buy a house next summer in our HCOL area. I have always assumed we would get a normal 30year mortgage as those are what the vast majority of buyers get. However I have been looking into mortgages at our local bank and the specialist pointed out that the 7/1 and 10/1 ARM might be a good option. 

We are thinking of getting a condo in a great area with a not as great school system and moving out of it by the time our future kid goes to elementary school at age 6-7. I’m planning to get pregnant this year so we have some time. My partner is going to be a stay at home dad freelancing part time until said kid goes to school. At which point he’ll be more full time and probably be pulling in an extra 30k a year. I can pay the full mortgage, HOA etc now with a conventional mortgage, but if we got a 7/1 or 10/1  I could do extra payments each month to reduce the principle. Once we hit 7 years in the home if we didn’t want to move for some reason, we could refinance right? 

Since the initial payments are lower and one can refinance when the intro interest rate goes up at 7 or 10 years, it seems like a good deal. However 7/1 and 10/1 ARMs seem like the ugly stepchild of mortgages - help me understand why.",finance

I am young (26), unmarried but likely married in the next few years, no house or children. Long term partner is also a physician.

I have about $150,000 of debt in a student line of credit from med school (at prime minus 0.25%, so currently 3.7% interest rate annually).

I also have about $30,000 in investments (stocks+ETFs) that have grown considerably over the years, all sheltered in a tax free account (TFSA). Aside from this I have no significant assets. No RRSP.

I have found that since starting residency my income outstrips my expenses more than I anticipated, so I have been intermittently throwing money at my debt or adding to my investments. My question is this: Given my low interest rate, how dumb is it for me to focus on putting cash into investments over debt repayment? I have had good returns over the last 5 years (~15% annually, though I realize this is unsustainable growth).

Since I have no real obligations, guaranteed job, and strong earning potential in the future my risk tolerance is pretty high. Am I crazy for ignoring my debt for now when I can likely outpace my interest with investments like broad ETFs?

personalfinance,Best strategy for repaying Federal Student Loan Debt?,"I am in need of some financial advice regarding my Federal Student Loan debt. I've got just shy of $65,000 in debt on a loan that has ""negative amortization"". My $132 a month Income Based Repayment doesn't even cover the interest. So each month, despite making payments, I sink deeper into debt.

It is my understanding that I have two options:

&amp;#x200B;

\#1. Pay more per month (standard repayment plan, extended fixed repayment plan, etc). The issue here is that I don't have extra money to do this. I already have a second, part-time job in addition to my full time job in my field. I had to pick up this second job to pay for the ONE doctor's appointment I've had in the last two years. Even with insurance, one appointment cost me almost $1,000. In the next year or so, my SO and I are planning to move in together and combine finances. But he's an organic farmer and makes little money, and once we have kids, he'll probably need to stay at home since daycare is so expensive. Point is, I'm not sure that I can count on much income from his side in the next 5-8 years - plus, this is MY debt, so it seems like I need to take responsibility for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Or #2. Pay the minimum for 25 years, and get the remainder ""forgiven"" (and counted as income, being hit with a ""tax bomb"" when that 25 year period is up). I'm leaning toward this option. How do I calculate how much will be forgiven and taxed as income? I have 21 years of repayment left. Does it make more sense for me to set up a separate savings account for my ""tax bomb"" then to pay the loan off in full? ...Maybe in the next 20 years, we'll get some federal legislation to NOT have student loan forgiveness be taxed as income, but I know that's wishful thinking and I can't count on that to be a solution. Any advice would be much appreciated!

My take home pay each month is $2,266.

Home Payment/insurance/taxes (owner financed) = $725

HOA (365 acres of land) = $110

Utilities (does not include internet - I can't afford internet at home) = $180

Cell Phone = $55

Private Student Loans = $250 (Will be paid off in 3 more years)

investing,Municipal bonds vs inflation?,"I'm currently trying to establish some fixed income streams in my portfolio and keep stumbling upon bonds. They seem good if screened, but I'm having a hard time understanding the return difference between a tax deferred muni bond and a stock paying dividends with capital gains. From my understanding stocks that pay dividends aren't very volatile, so they can be thought of as fixed?

Pulling these numbers from some quick 'current' searches.

If I buy 100k worth of a **stock** with a dividend yield of 2.3%, not only does the stocks value keep up with an annual 2% inflation, but the yield is returned on top of that. My principle grew with the inflation rate therefore my yield is pure profit before capital gains? That means after 5 years id end up with roughly 100k+25k(inflated)+~2%x5=**135k**

If I buy 100k worth of **bonds** with an interest rate of 1.97%, the price of the bond is fixed. So if it's a 5 year bond my 100k is now worth 5k less per year due to inflation. By maturity the principle only has enough buying power as 90k, and then the tax deferred yield means **I break even, just barely at 100k** where I started. 


Is there something I'm missing that makes a bond such a popular option? I would really appreciate some help. I have seen the 'barbell' strategy mentioned as well, but I don't understand how having bonds maturing at different rates and re-buying them avoids the impact of inflation.",finance

personalfinance,Consolidation/BT mistake. Help me sort it out,"tl;dr ... and some figures at the bottom  *sorry for the block of text



I really goofed this one up, PF. I took out a consolidation loan to cover 4 CCs. ~$15k (APRs ranging from 24%-27%).  The ""mistake"" I made was taking out this consolidation loan too soon. Let me explain:



Two years ago, I started a 3-year plan. I applied the snowball method, and chopped my (nearly) $50k mountain of debt down to what it is now-- $15k.  Year 1 was dedicated to being super-duper frugal and pinch every penny; Year 2 allowed me to ""relax"" a little bit and loosen up on the budget so that it wouldn't be so long and grueling of a journey. And Year 3 (where I am now) is the ""final push"" to freedom.  Keep in mind, throughout the whole process, I've been shuffling CCs around with Balance Transfers.



So here's the thing. I walked into my bank today and they offered me a ""Holiday"" loan special. The banker told me that I was already approved.  Not ""pre-approved*"" but approved-approved (no credit check or applications; just a signature needed to accept).  $15k, 18%. 



 Honestly, if I had received this offer in the mail, I would've probably thrown it away because of the 18%... after all, I've been doing fine all this time by doing BTs.  But this time, it just felt like all the stars aligned-- I just hit the beginning of the 3rd year of my paydown plan, and I knew my 4 CCs that are on BT promos were due to expire very soon (1 of the 4 actually just expired last month, and I usually do these BTs in bunches... so I was actually starting to shop for other/new BT cards/promos).  And what took it over the top was that they offered $15k, and $15k is what I needed to do my ""final push."" [the term is set as a 4-year loan, but I really know I'll pay this off within the next 10-12 months... and no prepay penalty].



I signed the papers and had the money deposited into my account. I went home, logged onto my PC to take a look at my spreadsheet to see where/how the money should be disbursed...  Then I realized my mistake--  the 1 CC expired, but the other three cards' BT promos aren't set to expire until 2, 3, and 7 months from now.  (maybe i got a little too ""relaxed"" in year 2 and didn't pay enough attention to my schedule???)



Should I just pay off the cards that still hold the 0% promo? Or wait until the time comes for each CC, and keep the ""surplus"" money in the bank in the meantime...  (maybe even utilize it somewhere else for now)???   My gut move would be to just do the entire consolidation... payoff the cards regardless of the promo expiration.  But why do I feel like I'm wasting that 0%-- i basically switched the 0% out for 18%. what a dummy!



TL;DR

Have a little less than $15k balance on four CCs

CC1: $6400, 27% -- with 0% promo expires in 2 months 

CC2: $3300, 26% -- 0% promo expired last month

CC3: $2500, 25% -- 0% promo expires in 7 months

CC4: $1700, 24% -- 0% promo expires in 3 months

Took a consolidation loan for $15k, 18%, 4 year term.... but plan to pay off within 12 months.

Consolidated debt immediately even while 0% promos are still in effect? If not, what to do in the meantime while I wait for the promos to expire?

I worked a full-time position a few months ago for a short period of time (long story but I had to leave that position after a few weeks) and at that job, my average paycheck taxes were 15-20% ($18/hr, 7 paid hours a day, paid biweekly). I live in California.

I just started this job that I enjoy very much, and I get paid $16/hr for 8 paid hours a day, paid twice a month. I got my first paycheck and found that I had about $460 withheld from this gross paycheck of a little under $1500.

Estimated breakdown:

\- Federal withholdings: $250

\- FICA: $90

\- Medicare: $22

\- California withholdings: $82

\- California disability: $15

My estimated withholdings from this paycheck is 31%.

Is this normal for my income? I know California has a higher tax rate than most, but this doesn't seem right to me especially after asking friends who earn approximately the same amount that I do. And the huge difference in taxes between this job and my previous one is throwing me and my budget off. I accounted for a 20% tax rate, not over 30% and this leaves me struggling financially.

My employer told me it's the number of allowances I claimed on my W-4 (which I wrote as 1), and showed me how much I'd make if I claimed 2 or even 3. But the difference was only about $20 and $40 respectively.

Would really love insight on this. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Soon to Graduate Looking to Apply for Second Credit Card,"Hey all,

I am looking for some guidance on what credit cards I should be looking to continue building credit. Just a little about myself, I'm currently a senior, planning to graduate in May 2019. I have had Discover It for students since October of last year (1 year old account). I currently have USAA and Navy Federal Credit Union as my banks.

I carry no balance from month to month usually. I am looking at a 759 FICO score on my Discover app. Most of my pay is from a stipend I get from ROTC ($450/month), and drill pay I get from the Army which varies depending on how many days I drill a month (usually 3 days = $300). Combined, I am looking at about $700 a month.

I am currently looking at Chase Freedom, Citi Double Cash, and Navy Federal cashRewards, and USAA Cash Rewards Plus American Express Card. Are these good options? Are there any others I should consider?",finance
personalfinance,Im living in a car with my mom with 10k+ of debt and a low paying job,"The title sums it up somewhat. I'm emotionally exhausted and I wanted to see throwing my situation on Reddit could help me put a new perspective on my situation. This is in South Florida. Sorry if this isn't in perfect chronological order.

Ill try to sum this up as best I can, I'm 20 years old, engaged with a 9m daughter. My fiance and I lived separately as shes 18 and I don't get along with her mom very well. My dad who lived outside the country was providing for my mom and I but has always been bad with debt. Back in January I took out a loan for 2k with the bank to help cover our ass with a month of rent. My fiance had advised against this and I dismissed it. Months passed, we chugged by, late bills here, no light there, etc. In August my dad got behind on the rent by over 2 months. I, again, went ahead and took out ANOTHER loan, very reluctantly and somewhat pushed to by him, for 4k. A month before this, he asked me to add him as an authorized user to my credit card as the limit was high and he thought it would help him build his credit again in the US. He used the card on small things like a big mac here or small groceries etc. 

Anyway, as it turns out, the 4k I gave helped with nothing and we still had to leave our home since the property managers or whoever did not want to renew our contract. Before we knew (or I knew) the contract would not be renewing, he went to a car dealership and with his atrocious credit and zero down, managed to leave with a 2015 RAV4 with monthly payments of $500. So then, after finding out, in order to try and get the deposit money back he dropped about 1k of debt onto my credit card with supplies like paint and a new microwave (he almost burnt down the kitchen earlier this year, the microwave and cabinets were damaged) among other things. Besides the point. 
That also did nothing, the property managers found plenty of different things to use that deposit money on which actually left us owing THEM $40.
So, he flies out of the country again which leaves my mom and I and his fucking car (which came in handy right on time for my own car to up and shit itself). My sister who lives out of state's MIL offered her office as a haven for two weeks until we get back on our feet. That was back in mid August. Anyway she's gotten fed up with us and we've had to put all our shit in my dad's car and tonight will be my first real night sleeping in the car. 
I should also add that I plan on joining the air Force though nothing is set in stone yet, I'm expecting to leave for basic in January or February. Though that still leaves my mom to worry about. This post doesn't really cover everything going on. No, living with my fiance is not an option as her mom's anal

CryptoMarkets,What legal precedent has been set giving the SEC authority to regulate markets not established by the authority of the U.S.?,"I hope the title accurately sums up the question here. This post may be a little outside the scope of normal discussion here but I'm not sure where else to post. 

I just read this [article](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/digital-asset-securites-issuuance-and-trading) about decentralized exchanges being target by the SEC for not registering as an exchange. I then found the actual Code of Federal Regulations [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/240.3b-16#) defining what an exchange is for purposes of the SEC. So here's what I don't quite understand. Private contracts are constitutionally protected. I can, in my private capacity, engage in a commercial transaction with another private party, and so long as the medium of exchange is a private currency, and the asset itself is free of any encumbrances, then what jurisdiction does the U.S. have to apply any U.S.C. or C.F.R. statutory regulations? None, they don't have any jurisdiction and we see evidence of this all the time when the assets of a private or foreign trust are called into question in open court. We've seen private contracts upheld in the Supreme Court as well. Anyone remember Halliburton getting sued for an arbitration clause they had an employee sign to limit their own liability? The court held that they could not even hear the merits of the case because the arbitration firm was expressed in the contract to have jurisdiction to hear any disputes. Courts couldn't even hear opening arguments. 

&amp;#x200B;

So taking that thought process a little further, if a developer created a website that was based on smart self executing contracts, where private buyers and sellers can come and exchange assets that exist outside of any federal jurisdiction (not all trade-able cryptocurrencies are private, many actually are securities and the coin itself totally falls under a federal jurisdiction.) then what authority does the SEC have to regulate or otherwise control those private buyers and sellers, and what authority do they have to obligate the developer to apply for a license to develop a website that just so happens to function like a market. It appears as though the C.F.R. prohibits anyone from creating a market place or a venue, no matter what technology is used, for anyone else to buy and sell assets of any kind. What legal precedent is the C.R.R. going off of? Has this particular statute been reviewed by appropriate courts? 

&amp;#x200B;

My next question is, what could anyone do if a developer created such a decentralized marketplace and did so anonymously. Just like the founder of Bitcoin. Creating a competing currency has gotten plenty of people thrown in prison or murdered throughout history, so arguably we can attribute the success of the entire Cryptocurrency market to the actions of an anonymous character who, had he/she not been anonymous would no doubt be in prison or dead today. Is the only real remedy for truly free markets for people to create these decentralized markets under the cover of total anonymity?

When you were born might be the single most important factor when determining your experience in the market. It’s also the one that is completely out of your hands.

From 1926 to today, there are 993 rolling ten-year periods. A person just starting to invest could have seen a market that gained as much as 596% or lost as much as 37%.

The Great Depression left scars on an entire generation. Between 1930 and 1951, only eight people were hired to work on the NYSE trading floor. If we were to experience another catastrophe like this today, the Dow would be below 3,000 in September 2021. If I saw stocks fall 90%, I don’t think what happened next would influence me at all. The Dow could rise to 50,000 by 2030 and I would kick and scream the whole way up, with a tin foil hat on for good measure.

People in the 1960s were certainly aware of what their parent’s experienced in The Great Depression, but it wasn’t their experience. They knew about the crash, but they couldn’t remember it.

Think about people who came into their prime earning and investing years in the late 1970s. They remember the oil embargo. They remember waiting in line for gas. They remember high interest rates, and they certainly remember high inflation.

In 14 out of 36 months from 1978-1980, CPI came in over 1%. In the 452 months since, that’s happened just 6 times. $1 after inflation shrank to $0.72 in just 36 months. This sort of shock stays with you forever.

# **Trump's trade war with China could disrupt the traditional Thanksgiving week rally  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/trump-trade-war-with-china-could-disrupt-traditional-thanksgiving-rally.html)**
*****
&gt; As stocks enter the short Thanksgiving holiday week, investors looking for any signs of a market comeback are paying close attention to trade developments with China.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump gave the market a boost Friday when he said he was hopeful the U.S. and China would strike a deal on trade, a major focus for stocks. But White House officials later downplayed his comments and said there were no signs of a deal coming soon.
*****
&gt; Stocks closed with gains in the S&amp;P 500 and Dow on Friday and a slight loss in the Nasdaq. But the past week was the first negative week in three, with the S&amp;P down 1.6 percent, and Nasdaq off more than 2 percent as tech took a pounding and Apple lost more than 5 percent on the week.
*****
&gt; ""Everyone knows the 800-pound gorilla in terms of risk is the meeting between Trump and Xi,"" said Julian Emanuel, chief equities and derivative strategist at BTIG. The market has been hanging on every development ahead of Trump's meeting with China President Xi Jinping at the G-20, which begins at the end of the month.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, Wednesday brings durable goods, consumer sentiment and existing home sales data. Retailers continue to report earnings, with Target, TJX, Best Buy and Kohl's all expected Tuesday.
*****
&gt; More often than not the Thanksgiving week is a good time for stocks, but strategists have also been warning the market could retest the October lows before heading higher. According to the Stock Trader's Almanac, the Dow was up in the week before Thanksgiving 19 of the past 24 years. Since 1988, the Almanac says, the Dow was higher Wednesday and Friday of Thanksgiving week 18 of 29 times.
*****
&gt; Strategists had been expecting the post-midterm election period to be a positive for stocks, with the market heading higher in the fourth quarter. But with the recent turbulence, the midterm pattern and even a Santa rally have been in doubt.
*****
&gt; ""We have been thinking of this basically as the typical 10 percent plus correction that we've seen numerous times since the bull market started in 2009. There is literally nothing we have seen over the last seven or eight weeks that would lead us to believe otherwise,"" said Emanuel. ""The correction started with the uncomfortableness of rates rising too fast, similar to February, and then in the middle of the stock market turn down, it flipped to extreme growth fear. In our view, neither point of view is warranted.""
*****
&gt; Emanuel said it may also be a positive that the Fed has slightly changed its tone to sound more dovish. He said that was his perception when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke Thursday and indicated that positive growth overseas is important. The markets have been concerned about global growth being impacted by falling commodities prices, the higher dollar and trade friction.
*****
&gt; Positive trade developments could be a catalyst that could snap the stock market out of its funk and ignite a year-end rally, but strategists also say a negative outcome could keep the market under pressure.
*****
CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell said ""we see the trade dispute with China as the single most concerning issue facing the market near-term.""
*****
&gt; ""Not much may come from the [Trump-Xi] meeting, which the market may be able to absorb, but a lack of a trade deal or an escalation of the current situation without a plan for resolution by year end could result in an ugly start to 2019 for global equities as well as the U.S.,"" Bell wrote.
*****
&gt; Some strategists believe there could be some signs of progress made at the Argentina G-20, but Trump may still raise tariffs to 25 percent in January and put tariffs on more goods.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said even just signs of potential progress would be a positive. ""The president is sensitive to the stock market as a reflection of how people are judging his performance. He looks at the weakness of the several weeks with probably as much, if not more, concern than the average investor, given all the headwinds he's going to face politically, given the fact you now have a divided government,"" said Emanuel. ""If we're right, there's going to be some sort of progress you can point to. The market will rally well in advance [of the meeting.]""
*****
&gt; Barclays economists Friday said in a note that they see more signs of a possible U.S.-China agreement, as the dialogue between the two countries has become more productive ahead of the G-20.
*****
&gt; ""The potential outline of an agreement: A smaller trade deficit and increased market access in exchange for tariff relief. In our view, a 'framework agreement' at the G20 could include commitments by the Chinese to purchase more US exports — primarily in agriculture and aircraft — and steps to increase openness to the Chinese economy for US services companies,"" they wrote.

# Thanksgiving Market Returns

&gt; Thanksgiving week has historically been a positive time for the equity market. Since WWII, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.64% during Thanksgiving week with gains three-quarters of the time. Market trends heading into this Thanksgiving aren’t as positive for the bulls, though. As shown in the table below, during years where the S&amp;P 500 was positive but up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the index’s average change during the week has been 0.00% with gains less than half of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/111618-Table.png))**

&gt; On a day to day basis, for both all years since WWII and in years where the S&amp;P 500 was up less than 5% heading into Thanksgiving week, Monday has been the worst trading day as it is the only day of the week with negative average returns and positive returns less than half of the time. Tuesdays and Friday, however, have been positive days, though, with average gains of 0.10% and 0.29%, respectively. Additionally, for those years where the S&amp;P 500 was up YTD but up less than 5%, Tuesdays and Fridays have been even stronger with average gains of 0.26% and 0.35%, respectively.

&gt; As we move past Thanksgiving, though, seasonal trends for the market based on this year’s performance so far improve. In those years where the S&amp;P 500 was up less than 5% YTD heading into Thanksgiving week, the average gains the week after Thanksgiving was 0.41% with positive returns 55% of the time. For the remainder of the year, average returns were even stronger at +2.83%. Not bad for a period of just over five weeks!

# Let’s Talk Volatility

&gt; After the least volatile third quarter for the S&amp;P 500 Index since 1963, volatility has come back in a big way over the past six weeks. One of the big themes from Outlook 2018: Return of the Business Cycle was to expect significantly more volatility this year versus what we saw in 2017.


&gt; “Last year we saw the S&amp;P 500 change at least 1% (up or down) only eight times—one of the least volatile years ever. Well, so far this year we’ve seen that number jump up to 50. One thing is for sure, markets don’t stay calm forever, and we are seeing that in 2018,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the average year actually has 50 1% changes— which makes this year maybe not as extreme as some might think. Of course, many of the 1% moves this year have come in bunches, making things seem worse.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fifty-one-percent-changes-this-year.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; So this year feels really volatile, but would you believe it is actually one of the tightest trading ranges we’ve seen in years? Yes, there are still seven weeks to go before the year is over (so this could change), but as of now, the S&amp;P 500 has traded in a range of only 13.6% from the February closing low to the September peak. This is about half the 27% average range for all years going back to 1950.

# S&amp;P 500 Not the Best Economic Indicator

&gt; On a closing basis, the S&amp;P 500 nearly reached correction territory in late October when it declined 9.88% from its high close on September 20 to its recent low close on October 29. After bouncing higher ahead of and after Election Day, S&amp;P 500 has fallen for four straight days and is on track for a fifth day of losses today. But, just how good of an indicator is the S&amp;P 500? Is it really on track to forecast a U.S. or global recession in the near future? A look back at S&amp;P 500 past track suggests about a 1 in 3 chance of recession at this point.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdbbbec75e99843603973f167dd85ca6/tumblr_inline_pi7cgs7Ljs1spdppr_540.jpg))**

&gt; First a quick review of definitions. A bear market is defined as a 20% or greater decline in the S&amp;P 500. A correction would be a decline greater than 10% and less than 20%. Based upon these definitions every bear market begins as a correction, but not every correction becomes a bear market. As of today, the S&amp;P 500 is not yet even in a correction. To be in a correction it would need to close below 2637.67.

&gt; Since June 15, 1948 there have been 11 S&amp;P 500 bear markets and 24 corrections. Excluding the current pullback from the tally there have been 35 declines in excess of 10%. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research has only identified 11 recessions over the same time period. This works out to less than 1 recession for every 3 S&amp;P 500 declines in excess of 10%.

&gt; Current market weakness could manifest into a full blown bear market, but economic data, corporate earnings and consumer sentiment would need to deteriorate significantly. Currently forecasts are looking for a slowing in growth as the initial effects of tax cuts and deficit spending wane, but corporate profits are not expected to decline, only slow their pace of growth. A slower pace of gains from the market would likely result.

XRP,XRP rumblings,"I'm hearing a lot of talk lately about the dollar tanking and stagflation on the horizon, with the Fed's hands being tied. Many think wealth will pour in to xrp much like it would into gold or silver as a safe store of value, all the while xrp is on the brink of gaining traction and worldwide use. It seems like an unprecedented situation. If this were to happen, does this completely undermine the fed and their ability to exercise monetary policy in a meaningful way? 

Any thoughts on this?

I checked WW2 (~20€) but the playerbase is dead, and considering I have a restricted NAT I won't be able to play.

Also seen Titanfall 2 (10€)  which is a bit better than WW2 but I'm not sure about it, still has a nice campaign.

There is Battlefield 1 (10€) which still has a very good playerbase and a good campaign but I have no idea how the sniping feels on pc. 

I'm not looking at BFV until next year.

personalfinance,Are there any options for refinancing student loans?,"Hey all, I will be graduating with a 4 year degree in the next coming months and I’ve taken some loans out for paying my tuition. The majority of the loans are government loans, which I’ve heard horror stories about when repaying them. The interest rate is pretty high on those and I’ve heard they can be really difficult to get on top of.

I’ll be living with my parents for a while after graduation so I should have a good amount of income to throw at the loans. I do plan on buying a car in the spring, but other than that I won’t have any large expenses. I have a job lined up for after I graduate paying around $50,000.

So my questions are: is there a better way to pay off government loans? Are there options for refinancing them that could save me money and make it easier? Or is the best way just paying them off at a payment much higher than the minimum they ask for?",finance
personalfinance,My Debt Strategy for 2018-19 - Feedback?,"Taking the advice of this subreddits wiki, I recently put together a spreadsheet of all my debts with a plan to pay them down. Basically, I'll start off using the snowball method and change to the avalanche method hopefully around next summer as I get a few lower balance accounts eliminated. I’ve listed the debts below in priority and then a quick reason and goal behind each account. I'm wondering if this is a decent strategy and where I could possibly improve it.


**Unsecured Loan:**

 * 29% interest / $3700 balance /$500 payment

 *  Goal: Use January 2019 Bonus to speed up payoff (March instead of August) and free up $500/month to snowball small balance CCs

 * Estimated payoff: March 2019


**Credit Card 1:**

 * 24% interest / $500 balance / $25 min payment actual of $50/month

 * Goal: Payoff and close account due to irresponsible use.

 * Estimated payoff: April 2019


**Credit Card 2:**

 * 24% interest / $750 balance / $25 min payment actual of $50/month

 * Goal: Payoff and close account due to irresponsible use.

 * Estimated payoff: June 2019


**Bank Line of Credit:**

 * 15% interest / $1500 balance / $45 min payment actual of $55/month

 * Goal: Use mid-year bonus to pay off. Possibly leave open as the lowest interest of all accounts and transfer balances from higher rate CC accounts?

 * Estimated payoff: Sept 2019

At this point, I’m curious what my best strategy would be to pay down the remaining credit cards (3-7) as they have similar balances and rates. Should I just continue aiming at the lower balance accounts and close as paid off? Would it be a better idea to leverage my lower interest rate line of credit, transfer balances there and close?

**Credit Card 3:**

 * 29% interest / $2400 balance / $80 min payment actual of $100/month

 * Goal: Payoff, maintain zero balance, but use for monthly bills to leverage cash back benefits?


**Credit Card 4:**

 * 25% interest / $2400 balance / $80 monthly payment

 * Goal: Payoff and close account due to irresponsible use.


**Credit Card 5:**

 * 24% interest / $3500 balance / $110 monthly payment

 * Goal: Payoff and close account due to irresponsible use.


**Credit Card 6:**

 * 24% interest / $3500 balance / $110 monthly payment

 * Goal: Payoff and close account due to irresponsible use.


**Credit Card 7:**

 * 21% interest / $2000 balance / $60 monthly payment

 * Goal: Payoff and close account due to irresponsible use.",finance
personalfinance,"I'm a recent graduate, should I withdraw all the money in my mutual fund to pay off student loans?","So, I've been trying to calculate my rate of return of my mutual fund, and it's seeming like I'd be better off doing *literally* anything else with it? It's not a lot, due to a family member secretly withdrawing most of it (She was managing it, technically legal.)

**October 2017** the mutual fund was worth **$2,372.** I didn't touch it, didn't add or withdraw for a year, and This **October 2018** I had **$2,384** in it. 

So I made $12 bucks at what I believe is a .5% interest rate? Less than I could get in my bank's saving account. Less than all the nickles and pennies I found on the street last year. The previous years are harder to calculate, as there were 10s of thousands of dollars being withdrawn from it. Adding back in what was withdrawn to the value (is that how I calculate it?), I believe the rate of return for 2016 - 2017 was 3.7%. Much better, but that feels inflated, because the amount wouldn't have been that high if the shares weren't actually sold? I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have **two $5,500 student loans at 4.5% and 3.5%** that I must start paying back in December

&amp;#x200B;

So, it seems to me I should just take out all of that mutual fund and pay down my loan balance, since I'm making less than I'm losing on interest. I have a decent job, no car payment, and around $4,000 in savings, which is enough for about 3.5 months living expenses since I'm frugal. 

Should I do this? Or should I pay some of my student loans and invest in a higher yield something?

personalfinance,Pay Off Mortgage Early or Invest?,"I am a M (28) who just bought a $63k condo in Jan this year in Michigan. I am trying to figure out if I should keep paying extra every month to pay off the mortgage super early or start investing money. I do not really have much experience with investing or finance. As of the November payment I still have $39k left to pay on the 30 year mortgage with 4.75% interest rate. I make about $45k a year with a 2-3% raise every year. My company has a 401K match of 4% and I contribute 10%. I always have at least $10k in savings at all times. The Condo's property value has also already gone up to $65k just this year.

Internet-40

Electric-30

Condo Association Fees-230

Condo Insurance-15

Car Insurance-100

Phone-50

Food-100

Gas-30

Other-100

Right now since I bring home about $2500 a month after taxes, I usually pay $1500-$1800 into the mortgage every month and save whatever is left. If I continue what I am doing there is a chance I will have the mortgage paid off midway through the year 2020. I do have a girlfriend but we are waiting until she is done with school to move in and get married which will be at least 2-3 years if it even happens. We also are leaning towards not having kids. I also am more of a Staycation person, so fancy Vacations are not my style. From what I have researched it seems that investing is the better option but I really want to make sure. I would like to at least partially retire in my 50's or even earlier if possible, but I know that is slightly unrealistic. I do not really need a fancy lifestyle, heck even the lifestyle I am living now is fancy to me. Should I keep going and pay the mortgage off early? If I invest, how should I go about it?

personalfinance,"Focus on student loans, invest, or save?","Hi all, I am looking for some tips/advice primarily on where I should be directing spare monthly income, but any other tips are much appreciated!

Right now my plan is to finish paying off my student loans (details below), however, perhaps I should be investing in a Roth IRA instead (in addition to my retirement account). Please let me know if there's any additional info that I can include that may help.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:  I'm 23, single, making \~$75k/yr in the Midwest, and living at home to save money.

**Current Savings/Retirement accounts-**

\-Have about \~$20k in savings currently (including emergency funding) in my Ally Savings account @ 2.00% APY. I was trying to maintain $12k as my ""emergency funding,"" which may be excessive given my expenses detailed below. The rest I'm trying to decide to drop on student loans or invest.

\-Have a Betterment account with \~$4k in it, which I contribute $100 to each month. I have my goal listed as ""emergency funding,"" however, I'm primarily using it as a low-effort form of investing.

\- Have an IRA with Betterment with \~$1k in it, which was a rollover of a 401k from a previous employer. I do not contribute anything else to this. Maybe there's a better use for this money?

\- Have a Fidelity retirement account with my current employer, contributing 16.5% (including my employer's match). 5% is Roth, and the remainder is before tax. I'm using a target-date plan, but perhaps I should get more involved with this. I have read index funds are a good option... Should I be contributing more, or is additional investing on the side a better option such as a Roth IRA with Fidelity?

**Debts/Monthly Payments-**

\- Monthly payments, including minimum payments due on student loans and car loan, bills, money for food/going out/living costs, etc: \~$1500.

\- Started paying off my federal student loans a year ago when my grace period ended, with about $50k in student loans at that time. My current balance is \~$29k at an average interest rate of 3.7%. About $9k is just over 4% interest rate, and the rest are 3.5-3.6%. My original plan was to pay off all of my student loans by the end of 2019, but perhaps this is not the best approach due to the lower interest rates. I'm also tempted to just pay them off to get this debt out of my life.

\- Owe \~$15.5k on a car loan at a 3.9% interest rate. Has 60 months remaining. I want to put a little extra toward my loan, but my lender will only put extra payments toward next month's bill instead of the principal balance (without calling to have them redirect each over-payment); as a result, I'm planning to refinance this loan for more freedom on that front and for a lower interest rate. 

**Extra Details-**

\- I am considering purchasing a condo/townhouse sometime in late 2019 to mid 2020 (under $150k most likely). This would align with when my student loans are paid off if I continue my current path, however I need to build up a down payment too. My plan would be to eventually rent this property out. Is it a viable plan to invest money in a Roth IRA and withdraw for a down payment when I'm looking to purchase? Or should I invest separate from a retirement account?

\- After taxes, expenses, retirement account, etc. I have about $2400 to spare each month, which up to this point has been directed toward student loans.",finance

My lawyers took a third of the settlement. In years past, I could have deducted this amount from my settlement and not paid any income or withholding (FICA, etc) tax on it. Now my CPA is telling me she thinks I have to pay taxes on the full amount - that I can no longer deduct lawyer's fees.

I believe it's smartest to pay off the highest interest one first (avalanche method?). But lets say when you have the 7.5% one to 5,000 it's only gaining a little interest a month compared to the one at 25,000 with a 6.5% interest rate. So the bigger principal one eventually begins gaining the most interest. So there's some confusion for her there.

It's still best to pay off the highest interest rate loan even if others are gaining in balance faster, correct? Or is there a point when it's better to switch to the other loans.

SOrry for the broad question. I'm just hoping to help my girlfriend understand her loans better and the best payment plan for her.",finance

personalfinance,"Kill student loans, or save?","Before recommending I pay off my remaining student loans, hear me out. 

I graduated from college with around 38k in student loans almost 4 years ago. Since then, I've paid off all my high interest loan accounts - most of which were at 6.55% interest. My remaining loans are at about 7k total at 3.25% 

Now, one of my financial goals in the near future is to own some property as a condo/house so I can stop flushing my money down the toilet each and every month. Interest rates for mortgages are higher than that of my remaining student loans, and are predicted to increase even more in the near future.

I do have enough now in my combined accounts to pay off my remaining student loans, but it would dwindle my savings/emergency accounts.  Killing my student loans would give me an additional $350 per month to save, although it varies with my scheduled overtime.

Additional info: I'm currently at a stable well paying job (at least for my standards) and have a pretty good head start on my retirement. I also have a child to support. 

I have heard recommendations for both sides of the argument. I'm curious to see what you all think?

personalfinance,Employer Paying (or assisting with) Tuition - Always worth it?,"Hi All,

This is partially finance related, and you've given me good advice before so I hope you'll help with this topic. I'm applying for a new job. I have the requisite degree for the job. I have friends already working in this position with this employer who encouraged me to apply, so I think I have somewhat of an inside track. 

All of the employees in this position have an additional degree that I don't have. Some had it before applying, others went to school part-time while working and the employer paid half towards their degree. I've been told that in the final interview they will ask whether I'm willing to get the degree if the employer contributes.

The degree costs $37,500.  Let's assume $40,000 as the cost may go up while I'm in school, plus books and fees. The course of study takes 18-24 months as evening classes and I assume I'll study on the weekends as well.  The only university that offers it in my state is about a half-hour drive away (all of my friends who are employees there went to this same university program).  I've been looking but I don't see any university offering this degree online. 

On one hand, I can understand the argument that if your employer is willing to give you a $20K stipend, don't leave it on the table. I also believe that this degree would be helpful in future opportunities both with this employer and others. 

I have no student loan debt currently. My only debt is a home mortgage and a car with a good interest rate (that I was hoping to pay off faster if I got this new job which would increase my income). My credit score is over 750.  I'm guessing that I wouldn't be eligible for any kind of scholarships, I would probably just be offered the ability to take student loans to finance the tuition at whatever the going rate is in student loans when I finish the degree. I'm also guessing I'd have to pay some deposits and fees out of pocket right away.

I looked up the course descriptions and they seem interesting. However, I'm just not enthusiastic about going back to school for two reasons: 1. I was so happy to pay off my student loans five years ago and I really don't want to add to my debt; and  2. I'm concerned about the time commitment. One major reason I'm applying for this position is for a better work/life balance. At my current position, I work most evenings and weekends and my friends all tell me (and I see from their schedules) that this new job is basically 40 hours/week. I know the school would be temporary, but I saw an advantage of this job as getting my evenings and weekends back, and I don't really just want to trade working evenings and weekends for going to school evening and weekends.

I'm not sure what to say when they ask. One thing I thought about was asking if they'd be willing to pay for it completely. That might be a big ask, but maybe it doesn't hurt to ask? I would go to school willingly if I knew it was ""free."" Another thought I had was whether I could ask if I could wait a semester or a year to start - that way, I get a little time to adjust to a new job (and enjoy my evenings and weekends) before I have to go to school. On the other hand, once I get a taste of having a personal life, I may never want to go back!

Any other ideas or suggestions?  In the end, I know an education is probably a good investment, but I'm not feeling very eager. 

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Does it ever make sense to buy a house when still paying student loans?,"Hello! This is my first time posting to reddit so hopefully I am following the rules. Apologies, this got pretty long. 

I'm wondering if it ever makes sense to purchase a house when we also have student loan debt?

Details: My fiance and I live in Washington DC where we both have stable government/government-adjacent jobs with growth potential. We love the city and plan on staying long-term. We are getting married in 2019, have lived together over a year (been dating for three), and have joint finances.

Gross income: $170k

Monthly take-home: roughly $9k after taxes, retirement contributions, premiums. We are both expecting raises in January, won't know exact amounts for another month.

Savings (not including retirement accounts): $67k

Debt: $50k in federal student loans (from graduate degrees) at 7% interest; no other debt

Monthly rent: $1750 for a one-bedroom apartment in a good area

Monthly debt payment: $2500 (the minimum is $750). We are also saving for our wedding. 

As anyone in the area knows, the DC housing market is insane. We are looking at fixer-upper rowhouses with 2 bedrooms and a basement in rough neighborhoods (but getting better) for $650k. We could stay in that size house, assuming it has a decent elementary school, for 10-15 years. We could buy a brand new 2 bedroom condo for $550 in the same neighborhoods but would likely need to move to a larger place in the next five years. We plan to have max two children starting in the next two years (we are early/mid-thirties). Daycare in DC is roughly $2k a month for one child. 

Our plan has been to aggressively pay off student loans so that they are gone before we buy a house, freeing up income to pay a mortgage and future daycare bill. It would be tough to pay mortgage, daycare, and student loan payment at once. In this scenario, loans are paid off before the end of 2019 assuming we get raises and we use any money received from our wedding, tax refunds, extra paychecks etc toward repayment.

Worth noting that we will not have 20% down in any scenario. I know this is not ideal but it would take us another two years after paying off the loans to save that kind of cash. In the DC market, we think its a good investment to pay PMI just to get our foot in the door and start building equity.

All that being said, I am having major anxiety about our plan as housing prices and interest rates are rapidly climbing. My fear is that by waiting to buy, we are pricing ourselves out of neighborhoods that are within reach if we buy now. And I haven't even mentioned Amazon (ugh). Should we stick with our plan as-is or should we buy just to get into the market and be house poor while paying off loans at a less aggressive rate?",finance
personalfinance,Seeking advice for negotiating my sick wife's student loan debt.,"Hello, r/personalfinance. Thank you for looking at my post. I created a throw-away for this question.

I'm 47 years old. I make 80-90k year. I have 350k in a 401k. The house is in my name. This year I will make about 60k because I took a 10 week leave of absence earlier in the year to care for my sick wife.

My wife is 44 years old. She's an attorney. She was working as a public defender when we married. She entered our marriage with 160k in student debt, 80k of which is a Federal loan, and 80k of which is a private loan. She has about 25k in an IRA. A year after we married, my wife started to become ill. For three years, her health deteriorated as she suffered from a difficult-to-diagnose disease. During this time she lost the ability to work a full time job, but she kept up with her student loans with my help.

One year ago my wife's disease was finally diagnosed- She has a rare liver disease called primary billiary cholangitis. Basically, her immune system is attacking her bile duct, causing bile to back up and preventing her liver from functioning. There is a drug to treat the disease that works for some people. Most people with this disease end up getting a liver transplant. Shortly after the diagnosis, my wife suffered kidney failure due to a prescription drug interaction. She was close to death when she went into the ICU, and spent a total of 8 weeks in the hospital recovering. Today she is doing well. Her kidney function has returned, and her liver conditions seems to be responding to drugs. But she is weak and in chronic pain. She will probably never be able to hold a full time job again. We are currently trying to get her on disability, but that process is ongoing. She has no source of income aside from myself at this time. One year ago, at the exact time of her liver disease diagnosis, my wife stopped paying on her private student loans, and let them go to a credit agency.

So, the 80k private student loan debt is now with a credit agency. My wife and I are trying to settle that debt. My wife has been phoning back and forth with the rep from the credit agency, and they are on friendly, cooperative terms at this point. The credit rep is offering us a settlement of 70 cents on the dollar. That doesn't sound very good to me. He is telling us that he \*might\* be able to get us 60 cents on the dollar if he appeals to the loan holder. I think we should be down closer to 50 cents on the dollar, but what do I know?

So we of course realize that the rep from the credit agency is not working for us. He's working for the credit agency and he's motivated to get as much money from us as he can. And we are looking for leverage tools for negotiations. So my questions are: In your opinion, how do we get the best settlement? Is there a pennys-on-the-dollar number that is a ""good"" number that we should accept from the credit agency to settle the debt? Should we hire someone to represent us if we don't get that number? And what would happen if we defaulted? Could they sue me?

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. My wife and I both really appreciate it.",finance

My fiancee and I bring in about $3800/month together after taxes. Next year I will get a slight raise (roughly $100 extra per month), plus a second year bonus which will apply $5000 over 26 paychecks.

Our monthly bills come out to:

* $55/mo internet

* $100/mo for two phones

* $160/mo electric/water

* $1050/mo rent (we're looking to move to a cheaper place at the start of the year)

* ~$200/mo in groceries

* $60/mo pet food

* $50/mo gas

We have about $20k in savings, plus about $5k in checking. We are also getting married in May and her parents are giving us $30k.

My question is: should I go ahead and pay off all of my loans in one go once my first payment is due (January 11, 2019), or is there any benefit to keeping the debt for a little while? 

If there are any other details that you need to know, I'd be happy to provide them.

personalfinance,Upside down auto loan refinance- meh credit,"Hello,

So I'm sure this is a common question, but most of the post about this sort of loan is for people who have been severely burnt at a car dealership. My payment is reasonable but is making my budget a lot tighter than it should be. 

In 2015 I purchases a Nissan Versa using a 6-year loan 5.12%. I pay ~280 a month, plus 190 for insurance. The car is in pretty good shape, it currently has 38,000 miles on it. It also does really well with gas.  My work requires me to have a vehicle (Social work). I am starting a 2nd job to earn a little extra income.  

My issues are that my transportation cost is my biggest expense (280+190+50 for gas a month). I'm finally getting serious about my budget, but at the end of the month i'm left with 10$  I'm looking for ways to shrink my budget, but my rent is about as cheap as it can be for the area (rural ny). 

 In short, I'd like re-finance or re-structure my loan. My credit is about 570. I want to lower my budget to try and improve my credit. I know my interest rate isn't terrible. I see my car lasting 3-4 years without much major work on it. I owe about 9 grand on it, KBB is about 6,500. Does anyone have experience or guidance about this? It's a five-star bank. 

edit: I earn 40 cents a mile from my job. I get 20 a month for that. My insurance can't be lowered for a while, even after shopping around. I already used my two-month delay for car payments to finance a move after a sudden breakup.",finance
gaming,Game devs need to stop sucking Bejeweled's dick,"Don't get me wrong, it's a great game. Aside from the famous Money Crush Saga™ tricking thousands of people into paying for it, it just demonstrates a level of lazy in game developers. I've studied game design my whole life, working towards the big picture. Someday...someday. Anyway, lemme tell you something about originality in game design. Coming up with an original idea is easy, the hard part is working out the logic to make the code run as close to your idea as possible. Now, I'll admit, I have no rank to say shit in game development right now, but I know this just from my studies: If it exists, especially if it's famous, you don't even have to *know* programming.

I haven't looked into it because it's a cancer game now, but just from experience, I guarantee you can go to YouTube or Google and type in:

- ""make Bejeweled/____ crush saga in Unity""

- ""make Bejeweled in Unreal Engine""

- ""make Bejeweled in [insert game engine here]""

- ""make Bejeweled in Java/C++/other language""

and you will probably see *at least* one step-by-step tutorial on how to make the game professionally, leaving room for you to replace sprites and put your own ""creative spin"" on it.

I don't really care, other than the ones that pray on those who fall for pay-to-win, but it's just annoying to see so many of these *""kickass new fantasy game where you can fight monsters and live your life as the grand warlock of the fucking universe""* then that 5 seconds they show actual gameplay, it's just *another* Bejeweled knockoff.

From both sides of the coin:

- For the developer: why would people buy your game when a million clones already exist? Are you hoping to just mislead people with your action packed commercials?

- For the users: it's just incredibly lazy and annoying. I see console versions of this stuff sometimes. I can't imagine there's people out there like ""I want a DOS/smartphone game on my powerful simulation machine"" and if by some stroke of luck they do, they probably already have one of the first hundred released this year.

We get it, the gem matching game is fun, Bejeweled, Pokemon Trozei, [Insert Random Word] Crush Saga™, but the game choices are so fluffed up with that concept, regardless of a little fighting animation in the corner of the screen. If that's ***all*** you can make, maybe you weren't meant to be a game developer.

If you make a pay-to-win version with the sole intent of making your income their addiction, especially while also not even putting any heart into making a game of your own, you're a piece of shit.",technology
personalfinance,Used margin with my online stock broker...,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted some advice on how to handle this situation I'm in.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to sign up for margin and used roughly $30k of it to invest in some stocks about 2 months ago. The stocks I invested in are down or going through some correction, I'm down about $24k (-26%) at the moment. I'm not too worried about this however, I am invested for the long term.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was looking at my account in more detail, I noticed that I was being charged about 10% APR in interest rate. I know, I'm irresponsible and should have known about the interest charges before I agreed to use margin, though I believe the rate was originally 6% APR.  This rate compounds daily and I feel like I need to pay it off ASAP to avoid the margin debit from growing too fast.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few options here:

\-Pay off my margin with my regular income. The most I can contribute at the moment is $500 a month, though it would take forever to pay off and I'd incur a lot of margin expense. I think it would take about 7 years to pay off at that rate. I might be able to leverage another loan with a better interest rate, which would help the margin debit not snowball as fast.

\-Sell my stock and eat the losses. Currently have $24k in loss, so I would eat that right now but I wouldn't have to worry about it going forward.

personalfinance,30 and need advice... just waking up (CAN),"Hi all,
So I'm just starting to wake up to how stupid I have been with our family finances after reading about all the people my age making less than us yet with much more savings. Really need some advice as I'm realizing this can't continue...

So some information on us..
My wife and I make 220k to 230k a year combined before taxes. Works out to be around 150k a year after taxes. We have a kid on the way coming next year. The one of the things that that really woke me up was I read about people making 100k a year with 500k+ savings and here we are with about 4k in savings and 20k in chequing account and no other liquid asset. We're located in Ontario, Canada...

We currently own two vehicles (need to have two). Without going into specific details about which car, one is a 2015 german fully paid off costing about 68k at the time (maybe worth 25k now?) and another is a luxury car costing 135k at purchase. Right now there's still 90k owing on the luxury car.

I track our spendings on YNAB and from last year October to this year October we spend the following:

* Housing expenses: 73k (26k being a large renovation, 36k mortgage @ 3k/mth , rest is property taxes (4.8k/yr), utilities etc..)
* Car: 26k (1.5k/mth payment + fuel etc...)
* Vacation: 16k
* Food: 12k
* Regular bills (including phone, internet, house + car insurance @ 261/mth): 6k
* Spendings on clothing, electronic purchases (tv, computer, accessories etc...), misc things like wedding gifts etc: 16k
* Work related: 4k
* Other entertainment: 4k

All in all added up to 183k in that year (i know the above figures don't add up so here's a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/CU5JmOS) from YNAB - my category naming is a bit strange that's all).

Our current debt situation is roughly 550k on the house and 90k on the car. No other debts. We never owe anything on credit card always paid on time.

Doesn't feel like we're quite living pay chq to pay chq yet but I know this is pretty f***ed up... so could really use some advice on how to turn it around. The only thing I can think of is maybe selling the luxury car and buying something cheaper but at this point with 90k debt on the car I would be in 10k to 20k debt if I sell right now (car worth maybe 70 to 85k depending on my luck I guess - also had about 10k damage on the car from non at fault accidents) . And being a luxury car I feel like it'd be hard to sell private and if i trade in I'll probably get nailed on it.

At this point I'm actually considering selling both cars, even the one that's paid off since it's getting older and probably will have a lot of maintenance cost now that warranty is gone (being a german and all). Maybe a used SUV and a Prius (I drive a lot daily for work) or something since I heard those are good for the long run?

Any help/advice/tips etc would be greatly appreciated... clearly I'm an idiot as I think anyone would have realized 183k spending on 157k income is a bad idea. Advice on what to do with the car is also very much appreciated as I'm rather torn - not so much the luxury part but the fact that I'd probably have to borrow some funds to pay off debt on the car if I sell + incur new debt on the replacement.",finance

personalfinance,Best Place to get an Auto Refi?,"I'm likely buying a new Ford this week and there is an additional $500 incentive to finance through Ford Motor Credit, however, the interest rate is absurd (like 6.9% APR). I will absolutely verify this but I believe there is no pre-payment penalty or obligation to hold the loan for any length of time. So, I'm planning to get the $500 incentive and immediately refinance the loan with another lender. I have excellent credit so I shouldn't have any issues getting the best possible rate.

My question: Can anyone recommend a lender or online marketplace where I can shop to get the best rates out there? My local credit union's rates are the same I could get on a HELOC (3.99%) so I'm hoping for better. Yes, I've already used the google to find a few places but I'm afraid entering my info will cause a hard pull on my credit...want to limit that since FMC will do it once and I'm sure whomever does the refi will also. Just looking for recommendations based on a positive experience. Or if you want to tell me that $500 isn't worth it and just get a loan once and forget the hassle...I'm open to that too.

economy,Powell questioned the dollar's growth trend,"Last week, the US dollar had started off with a confident 0.6% growth, updating the 16-month highs on the dollar index and **throwing** [EURUSD](https://www.fxpro.com/trading/forex/eurusd) **down to 1.1200**. However, the American currency has thereafter shifted into a defensive mode, decreasing by 1.2%, as a result of Fed’s dovish comments and lower budget tensions in Italy.

Initially, the single currency was reinforced by the comments on the desire of the Italian authorities to come to a compromise on the budget, although the Government insists on maintaining important reforms.

&amp;#x200B;

However, Fed's hawkish mood had later triggered a decline. Powell highlighted the growth of volatility in the global financial markets, the fading effect of tax reform, as well as the decline in demand outside the United States. All these factors, as noted by the head of the Fed, may interrupt rising rates by the middle of next year.

The news had a serious impact on the dollar on Friday, **triggering a 0.6% decline**.

&amp;#x200B;

Although markets were significantly affected by the commentaries, it is fair to say that there was not substantial information out there to justify such an impact. First, Powell made it clear during his speeches that Fed was all set for the December rate increase. **Predictions of the FOMC pointed out a 2-3% increase in 2019, against 4% in 2018**. This slowdown was just a repetition of an already known predicament. 

Moreover, promising to make a pause in the mid-year rate hike, Fed returns to the previous scheme that the FOMC used until 2018: a rise in the beginning and in the end of the year, and a pause in the middle.

&amp;#x200B;

Simply put, Powell's comments last week were not as much of startling news as it seemed at first glance.

For the dollar rate, this could mean keeping the overall trend of growth with small reversals as part of an upward trend. Short-term, it is worth to pay attention to the dynamics of the dollar near 95.80 on DXY and t**he potential of EURUSD to continue its growth above 1.1400**.

&amp;#x200B;

The fall of the dollar index below 95.50 is capable of becoming a signal of an upward trend, while for EURUSD, **such signal would be received in the case of the pair growing above 1.1500**.

Such a development would review the prospects of the dollar, questioning the main scenario with further development of the dollar due to a divergence in monetary policy.",finance

MachineLearning,[P] I built a demo for playing with arbitrary image stylization in the browser,"Demo link: [https://reiinakano.github.io/arbitrary-image-stylization-tfjs/](https://reiinakano.github.io/arbitrary-image-stylization-tfjs/)

&amp;#x200B;

I built a demo for playing with arbitrary image stylization in the browser using TensorFlow.js. Instead of having a single network per style like previous algorithms for fast style transfer, only a single model is used for all style images. You can also freely mix styles together.

&amp;#x200B;

The original paper (not by me!): [https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06830](https://t.co/FAVPJhcR4V). In summary, a style network is trained and used to generate a 100-D style vector for any painting. This vector is then fed, along with the content image, to a separate transformer network for the actual transformation.

&amp;#x200B;

This 100D vector is basically a latent space of ""style"". And we can do interesting ""latent space-y"" things with it. We can control stylization strength via a weighted average of the style vectors of the style and content images. I found this useful for styles that tend to ""overpower"" the content image. We can also combine different styles by interpolating between their style vectors, and letting the network guess what a style in-between the two paintings would look like.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest issue with porting this to the browser was the model size. The style network is based on Inception-v3, which has &gt;97MB of weights. Using distillation, I was able to replace it with a 9.6MB MobileNet-v2, a 10x reduction in size. I think distillation is an underrated technique to bring some cool ML functionality to the browser, a lot of which use models too big to reliably deploy in a resource-limited environment.

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, I acknowledge the results are not perfect and will not look good for all combinations of style and content (can't get Van Gogh to work properly for some reason), but I think it's a good reason to get excited about what will eventually become possible in the future using the browser alone.

personalfinance,Student loans. Advise regarding full pay off,"Ok, I've got approx. 18k in student loans. I've got enough money saved up to pay it off in full right now (plus the extra needed to stay above water on monthly bills). I've been paying on them monthly so no issue there. Am nowhere near any pay-off program so their mine for the foreseeable future. I'd like to spend the money as a business investment but haven't found anything I'm willing to risk the money on. So another option is to pay off all my loans. If I chose to do this, before I drop 18k on student loans. Is there any options avavailble to reduce this amount that I'm not aware of? They are federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans, all in my name. I asked the loan manager if they'd offer a discount if I paid off in full and she basically laughed in my face so am guessing that's not an option. Are their alternative option I'm not aware that might reduce the amount even a little? My credit score is already top notch so barring actually buying a house it's not going any higher.",finance
personalfinance,"Credit card and ""identity theft""","Not sure best description of this except near identity theft and credit card fraud against me.

A week ago Saturday I got a fedex delivery of a replacement credit card. I wasn't sure why as I did not request one. I open it up and see 2 cards in there. One for me and another with someone else's name on it. I immediately call Wells Fargo (yeah I know) to report this and get a new card plus fraud claim. They say they are sorry, remove the false name and will send out a new card as well as escalate to fraud team to pull the call. Apparently the guy was able to call in the previous Wednesday(I had an email I found later saying to take a gallop poll about my recent call) and request being added o my card? I check my account and see there is some false email address changed from my real one. Funny is it could never be verified but there it was, changed by a phone call or I don't know. I then checked and froze my credit with all 3 and nothing looked out of sorts on those credit reports at least. I also changed my passwords to a new very complex one.

&amp;#x200B;

I was told card would arrive Wednesday. Wednesday comes and noting so call and was told to wait as shows in transit. I wait until Friday lunch. I get home and check mail and see a ""welcome to fedex delivery manager"" post card. I never signed up for that. I call fedex and work to clear that up and have that account deleted. Still no card I call Wells Fargo again and was told still shows in transit but they gave me the tracking number. I then signed up for fedex delivery manager for real and see the delivery was changed to some other address. I call fedex to report fraud and was told also the package was delivered the previous Wednesday despite the manager site showing in transit. I call Wells Fargo to explain this and escalate to fraud. Got old card ""killed"" and new card on the way. I also have it setup where I have to go into a branch to setup a special pass phrase for any call and to activate the card I have to go in with a photo ID to do so. Fedex also has it down if any unusual activity with my name would be flagged fraud.

&amp;#x200B;

Crazy but not sure what else to do. Was told to file a report with police. I suppose I better.

investing,IMF: Sounding the Alarm on Leveraged Lending,"""With interest rates extremely low for years and with ample money flowing though the financial system, yield-hungry investors are tolerating ever-higher levels of risk and betting on financial instruments that, in less speculative times, they might sensibly shun.

""For their part, speculative-grade companies have been eager to load up on cheap debt. Globally, new issuance of leveraged loans hit a record $788 billion in 2017, surpassing the pre-crisis high of $762 billion in 2007. The United States was by far the largest market last year, accounting for $564 billion of new loans.

""So far this year, issuance has reached an annual rate of $745 billion. More than half of this year’s total involves money borrowed to fund mergers and acquisitions and leveraged buyouts (LBOs), pay dividends, and buy back shares from investor—in other words, for financial risk-taking rather than plain-vanilla productive investment. Most borrowers are technology, energy, telecommunications, and health care firms.""

personalfinance,New Job - Time To Adult,"Hi all,

After a very long education, I'm finally getting into a job with enough income that I have personal finance decisions to make.

**Current Liabilities**

* Student Loans totaling \~$140k, ranging from 5% to 6.55%
* Credit Card totaling \~$8k
* I own my car, it's in pretty good shape. No plans to buy a home or car in the next 5 years.

**Current Assets**

* 403(b) from previous employer
* $1k savings

**New Position**

* $90k salary
* 10% employer contribution to 401(k) (automatic, no match required)
* $X employer contribution to HSA (I don't know this number yet)

I've worked up a plan from reading this sub, but would love some feedback!

&amp;#x200B;

**Priorities**

1. *Pay off credit card ASAP*. I plan to pay the minimum on my student loans, put $250/month into savings, and dump every extra cent onto the credit card until it's paid off. 
2. *Pay on student loans, expand savings.* After the credit card is paid off, I'll increase savings to $300-500 a month (eventually aiming for 6 months of expenses saved). I'll also start paying an extra $250-500 a month on my student loans, targeting the highest interest accounts first.
3. *Pay off student loans.* After I have a safety savings net, dump every extra cent onto my student loans, targeting highest interest rates first.
4. *Invest, buy a home*. After student loans are done, I'll open an IRA/roth, and start investing as follows:
   1. Max IRA/Roth
   2. Save $250-500/month for down payment
   3. Max 401(k)
   4. Max HSA

4.4 is probably ambitious, but I might be making more money by then.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone think I should emphasize investing earlier, perhaps in parallel with paying on student loans? Anything else big I'm missing?

personalfinance,"Need general financial advice for my partner, who earns more than I know how to advise on.","My partner and I are a pair of 35 year old gay guys who've lived together for a year, and while I'm decently well-versed in low-middle income financial stuff, I don't really have any good advice for him at his income level, and I figured you all might be able to help.

He makes $115k/yr working for the federal government in DC. We live in Baltimore, where cost of living is substantially lower for a cost of only an extra 10min of commuting each way from where he used to live in the DC area. I own the house we live in, and my mortgage/taxes/insurance/utilities come out to $1200/mo. When I bought the house, I formed an LLC to do so, and I charge us $1500/mo in ""rent"", with the extra $300/mo going into a fund for repairs/etc on the house. I make $60k/yr, but for the moment, we still split our housing bill 50/50 (though that's something I'd like to maybe change a bit in the future), so his outlay for housing is $750/mo.

He has no car, though I have one that is an older, used car that is paid off. I pretty much only use it for the 5min drive to take him to the train station in the mornings 3x/wk, the occasional grocery run, and my rugby team's practice 2x a week. It probably only has a few years of life left in it.

Our groceries/food/etc are probably about a 60/40 split, and meals out are probably a 70/30 split. We both eat frugally but enjoyably, with food/eating out coming out to about $400/mo, maybe a little higher on months when we're both super busy and have to rely on delivery services more. He pays for our internet/cable, because I previously didn't have them/use them, so that's his thing.

He has about $25k of student debt from graduate school, which has has paid minimums (which are super low) on for 5 years. We're unclear on whether he qualifies for the public service loan forgiveness stuff.

We travel a bit, with usually one larger trip (say, $4k for the two of us) and a few smaller, domestic trips a year that are never more than $1k, often half that. He often helps subsidize my half of these trips, since I earn half what he does. He spends about $200/mo on ""fun"" stuff like books, etc.

After all this, he still has quite a decent chunk of money left over, that he doesn't know what to do with other than letting it sit in his checking account. He has about $20k in savings at the moment. He contributes the max to his 401k, and he doesn't have any debts other than his student loans. He grew up quite poor, and so he still has a lot of money-related anxiety, and often will avoid opening even minor bills for weeks because he's afraid of them, even though they're completely within his ability to pay them. Given what he earns, he should probably be investing some of it as well, right?

It might be a decent idea to get him a car when mine dies, and we have some improvements we'd like to make to our current house, and to start saving up for a better house.

Any advice on any of this would be greatly appreciated.",finance

Should I just leave them open and unused until they close naturally, and if I do, can I still get a good limit card opened if I have this many open lines?",finance

btc,"Ryan Charles makes excellent, unbiased arguments in favor of SV","Have a watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YG8gqBd3Mg

I think on technical merits alone, the Bitcoin Cash SV side has made the best arguments.

Being against Bitcoin Cash SV solely because of CSW means you're for trusting in authorities to decide monetary policy for you.

Furthermore, Bitcoin Cash SV seems closer to the original Bitcoin protocol than Bitcoin Cash ABC. If you're going to change the recipe, then you're an altcoin (like BTC). In general, I'm all for altcoins, but I don't think ABC can try to claim the Bitcoin title anymore. Bitcoin Cash ABC should compete with altcoins *as an altcoin* going forward.

AFAIK, the altcoins I'm familiar with have never made a big deal out of which ticker symbol they use, because they compete solely based on the merit of their technology. It's only the ""*real* Bitcoin"" communities that seem more obsessed with their relative crypto social statuses/title than the technology itself.",cryptocurrency

In the last week, I called all of them and was able to get everyone to settle for less and let me set up a payment plan. 

I paid off 1 debt that was for a small sum already, made a $212 payment on one debt I settled for $687. I was able to settle one $2000 debt for $1,200 to avoid legal action, and set up a payment plan, today I made my first payment of $600. My largest debt was $3414. They settled for $2400. Next week I make the first of 2 payments of $1200 on that. I will be out of credit card debt by January 11th. 

Here’s what I learned. 

Have an emergency fund. $1,000. Trust me. 

Don’t ignore the calls and the letters. I ignored them for a very long time. And it landed me almost getting sued. Call them back. Be nice. Work with them. They want their money and no one thought twice about letting me settle for a lower amount. 

What I learned about my budget. 

I don’t need 2 coffees a day. I don’t need to uber to friends houses when I live in one of the most transit friendly city’s in the country. I don’t need to mindlessly shop. I need to pay my rent, my bills and make sure my cats are healthy and fed. Spending money for fun is great, but I haven’t been miserable without it. I’ve been doing okay and I’ve saved every penny to pay off debt. 

I sold things I didn’t need and made an extra $300. I left my debit card at home when I was at work and didn’t use it to buy an extra coffee or snack on my breaks. 

All in all, I wish I had never owed the money and had never let it get this bad. But I learned a lot about my spending habits, my budget and myself. And I learned an important life lesson to never let this happen again.",finance

personalfinance,Buying my first used car - Help!,"Hi All!

So, I have leased cars my whole life, but with a new job and a long drive, I believe it’s time to buy. I also believe used is our best option, to get the price and features we need for a minivan (family needs are in play as well). We have found a van we really like at CarMax. It’s a 2015 Chrysler Town &amp; Country with 19k miles, about $22k. So, figure 8% on top of that for NY tax, and then their CarMax service warranty for $2600, and we’re at about $26k. I’ll put $4k down, so I’m looking at a used car loan for $22k. 

MaxCare covers everything \_except\_ wear and tear like oil, breaks, wipers, and then anything caused by corrosion (they suggest keeping the undercarriage of the car regularly washed in the wintery climate to avoid rust). MaxCare will cover up to 125,000 miles on the odometer, or 5 years of ownership, whichever comes first. At the $2600 price point this means it would be a $0 deductible as well. A $50 deductible only saves a couple hundred bucks in total on the total coverage cost. 

CarMax only offers 6 year (72 month loans). We may not end up keeping the car the whole time (who knows), but it seems like that’s a long time to have an auto loan on a used car? Cars are a sunk cost to me, but that long of a loan on an already 3 year old car scares me for some reason. On the plus side, our monthly payment will be much more manageable (About $430 a month for a $22k loan with a 6% interest rate and 72 months). I really don’t want a car loan more than $450. I realize I can probably save a \*little\* money going with a credit union or something for the rate, and possibly a 60 month loan instead.

Other context: In about 3 years we are done with daycare which will be a huge burden off our backs for flexibility with monthly payments. 

So, I guess I need a little reassurance here. Without knowing my other financials, does any of this seem like a terrible decision? Anything to reconsider?",finance
personalfinance,"Home equity loan, or credit cards to pay for move?","I feel my options are rather limited here, but I wanted to ask for advice, because...you never know.

I'm a married firefighter with 3 kids, living in Columbia, SC.  I make $38k per year, maybe $41k with overtime.  My wife is a nurse, but she's mostly a stay at home mom.  She works maybe two or three shifts per month, but it's not something we add in to the budget because we can't count on it and it isn't much money.  She also homeschools the kids.
Our only debt is our house (worth maybe $110k, that we owe roughly $70k on), and a minivan that we owe $12k on.  We have no savings at all.  We've spent the last 8 years pumping our tax return (the only extra money we have every year) into student loans and other debt, and finally paid them off in the spring of this year, so while we have no savings, we know we can count on about $5k from the return in the spring (baring some sort of crazy change in the tax code).
Now, on to the current situation I'm wrestling with:
My parents own and live on 24 acres of land about 45 minutes away from us.  For years, our plan has been to build a house on that land so that we can be there for them as they age.  We were never really sure how we were going to pay for it though.
About 2 months ago, someone offered us a single-wide mobile home, in very good condition, for $1500.
Here's the plan, please tell me I'm not TOOOO crazy.

Buy the mobile home = $1500
Clear the land to put it on = $6000
Get the home moved = $2000
Install a well and septic tank = $8000
Total Cost = $17,500.

Move out there, sell the house to pay for everything, and live mortgage free, next to my parents. 

But all of that stuff has to be paid for BEFORE we sell the house, which means we need to come up with something.  The options that I'm aware of are a home equity loan, and credit cards.
We have really good credit (807 according to Credit Karma), and we have two cards with $10k limits and 7.9% interest rates.  Because we have so little (zero) wiggle room in our monthly budget, our main concern is keeping our monthly payment as low as possible for the 6 months or so that we'll have to make payments on the debt before we sell the house.  I believe (though I'm not certain), that the monthly payment for that amount of money in an equity loan would be higher than with the credit cards.  I'm not sure how I would find out though.
Advice?
If it's the case that the credit cards are cheaper per month, as much as it SOUNDS like a TERRIBLE idea, putting everything on the credit cards might be the way to go.
I can pick up extra overtime very easily, but it's difficult on the family to pick up TOO much overtime.  My limit is probably going to be about $500 extra per month, for a limited time.

This really isn't something we're willing to not do. We are the only family my parents have nearby who are in the physical condition to be able to help them as they get older.  We need to be there.  Of all of the bad options I have here to pay for it, which is the least bad?",finance

I've gone through the flowchart and wiki, but I just want to make sure there's nothing I'm missing. I'm using a throwaway due to lots of PII on my main account.

**Overview and Questions**

2019 will hopefully be the year that I finally hit a positive net worth, so I'm pretty happy about that considering I was at roughly ($85,000) about 5 years ago. I have built my emergency fund up to enough where I could maintain my current lifestyle for at least 6 months even with zero income, so I'm looking for my next steps on what to do financially. I do have a few specific questions; the stuff below it is just all the supporting details.

* My emergency fund is currently sitting in a savings account with my Credit Union with a dismal 0.03% return. Where else could I put this money to get a better return while keeping it liquid?
* At what point should I start looking for new investments rather than paying down loans? My current plan would be to pay off my private student loan for the psychological factor, then start throwing all my extra money at the 6.6% and 5.5% federal loans. After that, would it make more sense to start looking to invest while making minimum payments on the sub-4% federal loans and my car loan?
* Is there any place I could improve my budget?

personalfinance,My Personal Financial Management Holy Grail,"I've been struggling with my personal finances for a while now and I figured someone might help me out. I've read so many books and tried every app and I'm just not getting the results for so many reasons. I attempted a retrospective on why my personal financial management has failed so far and here's what I've boil it down to and what I want to solve my problems.

* **Problem 1**  

   * Apps like Mint, YNAB, Digit, etc. expect me to know what financial decisions to make. They are unopinionated (what I like to call ""dumb"") tools that leave the decision making process up to me.
* **Hypothesis 1**  

   * This flexibility to make the decisions can be liberating if the user knows what financial decisions to make but can be daunting to beginners or financially uneducated users. There are people like me that are not extremely financial educated on personal finance who don't have a personal financial plan. They don't understand debt, interest rates, saving, etc so they don't know how to use these dumb apps properly.
* **Conclusion 1**  

   * I want an app much like Mint that connects to my accounts to generate a financial history and then takes me through the steps from /[r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and the flowchart (direct link to flowchart -[https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png)). The goal of this being to educate me on what financial steps I should be making and guiding me through each step in the process.
* **Problem 2**  

   * Even if someone knows all the personal finance best practices and advice, executing on that knowledge is extremely difficult over the long term. Being consistently financially responsible is mentally taxing and usually boils down to mental fortitude and the ability to delay gratification.
* **Hypothesis 2**  

   * Executing a financial plan has some unnecessary friction. One being the daily grind to stick to a plan especially when it requires putting off gratification. Another unnecessary friction is that many financial tools are not optimized for consumer benefit. In some cases, financial tools have opposing incentives to their consumers because they make money from their consumers’ inefficiencies. For example, the extremely low interest rates on savings accounts.
* **Conclusion 2**  

   * Instead of just trying to educate me into making smart financial habits, I want an app to automate the right decisions for me based on my situation. But I want an app that's aligned the business model in a way that it's incentivized to help me make the best financial decisions for me. Then the app would have every reason to remove and reduce every bit of friction.

worldpolitics,US Has Killed Half Million In Wars Since 9/11,"In the aftermath of the deadly 9/11 terrorist attacks, the US has spent over $5.9 trillion on wars abroad that have resulted in the deaths of an estimated 500,000 people, according to Costs of War, research published by the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Rhode Island’s Brown University.

The report, published this month, reveals that some 370,000 people have died directly from violence related to US wars, while many more have died from malnutrition and devastated infrastructure. An estimated 250,000 civilians have died in American-led wars and over 10.1 million people have been displaced.

In addition, 6,900 US military personnel, 7,800 US military contractors and over 110,000 enemy fighters have been killed in US-led wars since 9/11.

These numbers do not take into account the more than a half million deaths caused by the war in Syria after the US government and other powers tried to topple Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's government in 2011.

The US-led coalition of more than 70 nations have been conducting military operations against the Daesh terrorist group in Syria and Iraq since September 2014. The US coalition's deadly activities in Syria are not authorized by the Syrian government or the UN Security Council.

The report also found that the cost of US-led wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria has cost the nation around $5.9 trillion.

That is not a typo. It's $5.9 trillion that the United States has spent to prosecute multiple wars around the globe since 2001.

According to the report, this number differs widely from Pentagon cost estimates for all the US-led wars following 9/11 ""because it includes not only war appropriations made to the Department of Defense — spending in the war zones of Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and in other places the government designates as sites of ‘overseas contingency operations,' — but also includes spending across the federal government that is a consequence of these wars,"" cited by the Brown University report.

In March 2018, the US Department of Defense claimed that it had only spent $1.5 trillion on ""war-related"" expenses since 9/11.

In addition, the current post-9/11 US-led wars were paid for almost exclusively by borrowing, which both increased the national debt and the US budget deficit, according to the report.

""Unless the US immediately repays the money borrowed for war, there will also be future interest payments. We estimate that interest payments could total over $7.9 trillion by 2053,"" the report warns.

""There is no strategy for ending the wars,"" political science professor Neta Crawford writes in the report.

""The fact that the US keeps spending huge sums for wars that, at least in Afghanistan, are in a stalemate, and in Iraq and Syria, are unresolved, is a long-term budgetary problem which will affect future generations,"" she noted.",technology
personalfinance,Should I withdraw money from stocks to pay for house downpayment?,"My bf (30m) and I (34f) live in Los Angeles and have been house hunting for the past few months. We got approved for a $500k loan at a 3.75% interest rate, would like to put down 20% so we don't have to pay P&amp;I and want to pay down the house equally. The houses we are looking at are in the $600k range.

I have money in my bank account for my portion, but my bf was planning on selling his stocks to be able to afford his half of the down payment and closing costs (~$65k). This was a great plan until the stock market decided to tank recently and he's down $20k in the last month and negative in his overall portfolio.

He has $40k already in his bank account and $70k left in stocks so if he sold his stocks he would only need to sell $25k worth. He's worried that bc he's losing money in stocks that now is a bad time to sell his positions. He wants us to rent an apartment instead which will cost about $1.6k/mo ($18k/yr).

I feel like he should sell his positions to buy a house bc for the 1st time in forever housing prices are starting to go down, interest rates keep going up, winter is a good buyers market and I'd rather put money towards my own mortgage than someone elses. Also, selling some of his losing positions would help with tax cuts.

Does anyone have advice on whether we should sell $25k of his stocks to put towards a house?

personalfinance,Why is there an upper limit for saving accounts?,"Hi folks,

I can't seem to understand why is there an upper limit for saving accounts after which banks will put down interest rate to almost a zero.  
I would kind of get that if they would allow you to open just 1 saving account but you can have more than 1. So basically if you are about to surpass the limit you can split it in two and still have the higher interest rate.  
For context: I am from Central Europe so banks might work here a bit different than in US. From what I read US customers don't have any upper limit for saving accounts.  


Here is example:  


Bank is offering a saving account with an interest rate of 3.65% up to 1500€ but once you surpass this limit they lower down the rate to 0.365%.

Now if I can open up multiple accounts where is the problem?

economy,Markets moved from irrational exuberance to anxiety,"The US dollar continues to develop a rollback from the multi-month highs, falling to 96.0 on DXY while triggering [EURUSD](https://www.fxpro.com/trading/forex/eurusd) to reach a two-week high, at 1.1450. Nevertheless, dollar’s rollback does not help any other assets, and although the weakening of the dollar usually sets offs growth in the stock and commodity markets, this is not the case this time.

On the U.S stock markets, we see a continuous sell-off of stocks of high-tech companies. Nasdaq Index had lost 3% on Monday, and at the start of trading on Tuesday plummeted to lows seen back in May, subsequent to the decline of stocks of market giant such as Google, Amazon and Apple. Pressures on Apple shares have plummeted the company's capitalization by 16.5% since the beginning of the month. Meanwhile, Facebook lost 40% from its peak values in the middle of the year and sank to low levels, which we have not seen since February 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

Powell's words in regard to the potential pause in the rate hikes induces a pessimistic sentiment in the market participants about resilience of the economy. Demand for U.S. Treasury bonds was on the rise. The words of Fed’s chairman were perceived as a signal that the Central Bank is not as confident in maintaining such a strong rate of economic growth.

With an exceptionally strong economy, growth stocks had the highest demand, and with the economy growth rate close to the trend levels, the focus of investors shifts back to the company’s performance. Under these circumstances, markets shifted their attention to the long-term average P/E ratios, in which the highest rates were in the IT Sector.

&amp;#x200B;

It is logical to fear that the correction of high-tech companies might spread to the entire stock market. It happens most of the time, but one should not rush to conclusions.

Based on what we have seen, it can be said that the end of the easy-money era, initiated in early October, resulted in the realisation of a more realistic view of the markets. This was manifest not only in the shift from growth stocks to value stocks, but it was also very noticeable in the dynamics of Crude Oil (-25% of October’s peak value) as well as in the Cryptocurrency market (-30%). Markets are on the way from irrational exuberance to anxiety. However, we cannot exclude the case that emotional sales may drag indices low on an emotional sell-off, throwing them to the other extreme, fear, in the upcoming weeks.",finance

personalfinance,"US Citizen working in Brazil - Balancing fx risks, interest rates, etc. (x-post from r/expats)","Probably a couple months behind the curve here, but have now been living and  working in Brazil for a Brazilian company since January, and have  amassed a pretty fair amount of Reais in the time since (housing stipend  + single = limited costs).

Up until this point, I've deliberately kept things as simple as possible - single bank account (Itau Personnalite - utterly useless), all payments /  transactions using this card (with minimal US-based CC expenses to keep  the accounts active).

Given the uncertainty around the exchange rate (now seemingly stabilized around  3.8 after as high as 4.2 earlier this year), but also the potential benefit of Brazilian interest rates / CDs (versus US low interest rate environment), curious if anyone has any experience / thoughts / counsel  on how to think about balancing USD / BRL currencies and how you would recommend taking money out of the country, assuming a 100% / 0% BRL /  USD ratio isn't recommended.

Also, in terms of taking money out of the country (assuming I've already paid  taxes on it) here in Brazil - I've heard some people say that trying to  work with the bank to change the BRL to USD and then carrying  &lt;$10,000 on your person.

From what  I've seen, Transferwise's bid/ask spread is much more competitive than  the bank's rates, and the IOF doesn't actually seem that bad (especially  if you're sending to friends / family \[0.38%\], versus yourself \[1.1%\]) -  maybe I'm missing something? Or is Transferwise the easiest / best way  to get money out?

Note that I'm likely to  be leaving the country by the end of next year, and therefore have no  reason to amass any medium-/long-term assets in the country.",finance

investing,"The sell-off can't end until these 10 problems are fixed, Jim Cramer argues","Ten things need to change for the stock market to come back from its Monday declines, CNBC's Jim Cramer said as high-profile technology stocks Facebook and Apple led the major averages lower.

""When does this rout end? When do the buyers come in? When do the sellers finish?"" he wondered aloud on ""Mad Money."" ""Frankly, we don't know, and that uncertainty is what allows this roving bear market to keep tearing us to pieces.""

Here are the various reasons that stocks are falling and what it would take for them to turn, according to Cramer:

&gt; Apple

Stories of Apple's alleged sales slowdowns, like Monday's report from the Wall Street Journal, are getting ""repetitive"" even as many investors treat them as new and crippling revelations, Cramer said.

""This market can't stabilize until Apple stabilizes,"" said ""Mad Money"" host, whose charitable trust owns Apple shares. He added that chart specialists have been saying that ""it's all over but the crying"" for the iPhone maker's stock.

""My view? Apple is a long-term hold, with its huge installed base giving the company's service revenue stream a lot of room to grow, which is why you own it [and] don't trade it,"" he said. ""However, I can't blame any big accounts for dumping it and, at least short term, I wouldn't expect the stock to bottom until some of the analysts start downgrading it.""

&gt; Facebook

Following up on his earlier comments that Facebook's stock would pop if Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg left the company, Cramer said that management has turned the social media giant's situation into ""an unmitigated disaster.""

""Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO, is now making Elon Musk look like the Dalai Lama,"" Cramer quipped. ""I've been calling for some sort of elder statesman to come in, ... like when Eric Schmidt took the reins at Google in 2001, giving the founders some adult supervision and putting the company on better footing. That's what Facebook desperately needs right now.""

Even though Cramer, whose charitable trust owns shares of Facebook, wanted to recommend the stock at its current levels, he just couldn't ""find a reason to jump in front of a speeding freight train.""

&gt; Software

Cramer sensed that the declines across the software sector were based on ""nothing, other than perhaps a sense that the global economy's slowing and slowing rapidly."" The weakness reminded him of late 2016, when shares of Salesforce.com slid from $81 to $54 on ""pretty much nothing.""

These days, exchange-traded funds that group related stocks together can pressure shares of high-quality companies when lower-quality competitors' shares start falling, he explained.

""The incredible thing is there's no concrete evidence whatsoever that anything is really wrong. Nobody's seen a real slowdown in the web,"" he said. ""How does it end? These brutal declines in tech typically end when the longs are finished selling and the valuations can be sustained. We're not there yet.""

&gt; Dip buying

""For the first time since the financial crisis, dip buying has failed,"" the ""Mad Money"" host warned, referring to his tried and true strategy of buying great stocks during their downturns.

He pointed to a number of tech stocks that have continued to slide through what looked like buyable dips, including Nvidia, Micron, Western Digital and NXP Semiconductor.

""The Nasdaq is littered with these breakdowns,"" he said. ""The presumption is that 2019 will be a down year. How can you rebut it? I have no real comeback to the theory that dip buying is dead because we've had no clarity on 2019.""

&gt; China

After Vice President Mike Pence's speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Saturday, Cramer worried that Washington's increasingly stark hard line against China could weigh on the market indefinitely.

""If this administration views trade with the People's Republic as simply providing fuel for their attempts to become a superpower, ... you could easily imagine them cutting off that trade entirely,"" he said. ""Of course, that would be horrendous for all sorts of American businesses — and it wouldn't work — but many people believe that's where we may be headed. I think it's extreme, but try telling the sellers that.""

&gt; Fed

Stuck between weaker housing data and strong employment results, the Federal Reserve represents the sixth piece of the market's puzzle, Cramer said.

""It's a shame that we need to wait until things get that bad before the Fed will change course, ... but they don't seem to care about anything the markets are saying,"" he said. ""The Fed wants concrete evidence of people being thrown out of work before they become less hawkish. I do not think that's the way to run the Fed, but I am definitively not in charge.""

&gt; Confusion

The few stocks that are bucking the broader market's declines are those that investors tend to buy when they're worried about an impending recession.

""Given that nobody thinks you can slip into a recession so fast after such strong economic numbers, there's genuine confusion. Confusion makes people want to sell,"" Cramer said.

&gt; Techincals

Even on a technical basis, things are looking ugly for stocks, the ""Mad Money"" host warned. The market will be hard-pressed to find a bottom with key support levels falling through left and right.

&gt; Retail

Those who think that the economy is so strong that it can handle any number of interest rate hikes are fooling themselves, Cramer said.

""When you look at all the very good retailers that have been shelled after they reported, great companies like Macy's, Home Depot [and] Walmart, that's the market telling you to be concerned,"" he said. ""It doesn't seem to concern the Fed at all.""

&gt; Selling

""We aren't even that oversold yet,"" meaning that a bounce could still be long in the tooth, Cramer warned.

""There's too much hope. There's not enough hatred in my Twitter feed,"" he said. ""The good news? If we keep falling at this pace, ... it won't be long before we reach oversold levels, where all hope is extinguished and we can bounce.""

personalfinance,Chevy Black Friday 0% APR,"Can some please explain to me how this deal would work?

Looking at buying a 2018 Chevy Cruz LT for $21,000, have $5,000 to put down.  Chevrolet has the following offer:

**0% APR FOR 72 MONTHS
PLUS
$500 CASH ALLOWANCE WHEN FINANCED WITH GM FINANCIAL

Expires 11-30-2018

2018 CHEVROLET Cruze excludes L. 
0% APR for 72 months for qualified buyers. Monthly payment is $13.89 for every $1000 you finance. Example down payment: 18%. Some customers will not qualify. Take delivery by 11-30-2018. See Dealer for details.

Am I understanding correctly the **$13.89 for every $1,000 you finance** means if I financed $16,000 I would be paying $222.22 a month ($16,000/72 months) plus $222.24 ($13.89 x 16)? 

If this is the case than this is really not a deal at all, right?  My credit is above 700 so I am pretty sure I would get a good interest rate if I needed to go another route. I am feeling really dumb about this whole thing.",finance
gaming,You can tell old games apart from the newer ones by the Male:Female ratio,"Edit2: Honestly was expecting comments like ""oh yea now that you mentioned it.""

Disclaimer: This post has nothing to do with politics. Please keep that out of it. There are plenty of places to fight about that, please don't derail the discussions by fighting about it here. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm of the opinion that you can tell old games apart from the newer ones by the Male:Female ratio.

&amp;#x200B;

Older games tend to have barely any girls, with lots of male characters ranging from cool looking to big burly and muscular either going topless he-man style or full armoured knights

&amp;#x200B;

Newer games tend to have a few males with lots of cute/pretty/sexy girls dressed in pretty clothes or barely anything

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I was referring more to the general cast. Like side characters, looking up older games it was a bunch of buffed guys. As a guy, I like seeing pretty girls and I'm used to playing these newer post-2010 games that have tons of girls in the cast. So seeing a cast full of burly men with like 1 girl felt like a big contrast. Hence, the post on my observation there",technology

personalfinance,I have to rollover a car loan. I need some advice on it.,"Hey yall. I just had spine/sciatic surgery a few weeks ago, and driving my car (with a manual transmission) is now difficult, to say the least. I had planned on driving it into the ground (2011 Honda) and I bought it way before I had an FI mindset and I was still swallowing the American ""put that shit on credit!"" load. Since I bought the car 2.5 years ago, it's depreciated quite a bit and I'm about $6k underwater on it. Having gotten on the path to FI last year, my wife and I have eliminated all debt except our cars. Hers is still above water and will most likely last 5 - 10 years after she pays it off (2 years of payments left).

I drive a lot for work, and because of this I get a nice mileage reimbursement check twice per month. I'm probably averaging a minimum of $500/mo, with the usual figure being closer to $700. I use this to pay for gas (I use a low-limit credit card for gas purchases and pay it off every two weeks in full with this reimbursement money) and until we found FI early this year, we pissed through the rest of the $ from mileage. So a few months back when we started the FI journey, I figured ""fine, I'll just throw at least $500/mo at this car and pay it off ahead of schedule!"". And then life happened, my spine was sliced open, and now I'm having difficulty driving the vehicle (the clutch hurts, which could also be dangerous). I need to go back to work in a week or so, which means I need to be driving again. Driving my wife's automatic is fine, as my left leg/nerve is affected and not my right.

So now life threw its wrench, and it landed in my spokes. Woot.

Keeping in line with the FI mindset and fiscal responsibility in general, I know it's a fucking horrible, terrible idea to roll over a loan. The way I see it, I have no choice in the matter - we have no savings (just finished paying off debt/starting saving - savings account total is $1125) to pay off the old loan. The interest rate on the old loan is like 10% (bought the car with shit credit) or maybe more - I'm confident I can get a 6 or 7%. Not amazing, but better than 10+. My mileage reimbursement is not going away any time soon - I'm with one of the fastest growing SAAS companies right now, in an integral role and according to my manager, I'm ""killing it"". I have no worries about my job stability or the mileage suddenly going away. If anything, we're leaning in a direction that may require more driving. Even still, if my role changed and the mileage went away, with our salaries combined we have an average of $2200 extra per month (after all current bills, including my current $220 car payment) that, as of December, we're starting to save. My goal of a minimum monthly payment would be $300 - this makes paying the minimum more than doable without any extra $ from mileage as a worst-case scenario, and it makes it so that I can still easily pay an addition $200/mo without mileage $ coming in.

Here's what I'm thinking:

**Roll the car into a new loan, pay it off ahead of schedule.** My goal would be a monthly payment of about $300/mo, with a minimum over payment of another $200 each month, likely more. According to my math with an early loan payoff calculator, an extra $200/mo on a loan total of $16.5k (assuming a car price of $12k, down payment of $1k rolling over $5k, and taxes/doc fees/etc) and an interest rate of 9% (hopefully I'm overestimating that) would pay it off in under 3 years.  

So here's my questions:  
If I'm paying this off that aggressively, should I really care too much about the interest rate? I know that buying a car is a headache in itself, and I would LOVE to be able to negotiate based off monthly payment a bit more. I understand that you should negotiate on the final price of the car, and I definitely will, but to not have to haggle over the interest rate would just make the process easier.  

**Is this a horrible idea?** The new-found trains of thought of getting our financial lives in order and being responsible are telling me it's a bad idea, but at the same time I need to work, I love my job, and I'm very vested in this company (if we do go public it's going to be a nice couple hundred thousand for me). In order to keep it, I need to drive and right now, I can't safely drive a manual transmission.  

Sorry for the wall of text, this is just weighing heavy on me.",finance

personalfinance,"If you just fell into $5K, which option would you choose to help your spouse? Vote and Why. Thanks!","Background assumptions: Spouse has a crappy car that is about to kick it, is $30K in debt with federal student loans and is a teacher (meaning they basically do volunteer work because they make nothing). Spouse hopes to get PhD at one point.

1) Put the money towards a new car. Argument: Spouse has a cash flow problem because they make no money. They will have to pay the federal loan debt regardless and although $5k is a sizeable contribution, it won't make that big of a difference in payments. At least with a car spouse can get to work and make payments without worrying about car payments for x years. 

2) Put it towards the principle of the loan. Argument: This will reduce the principle, the monthly payments (slightly), and the overall amount that spouse will pay due to interest. Not a lot of meaning now, but in the long run it makes financial sense. Wont do much for cash flow.

3) Put the money in a savings account or college savings account (529 or w/e it's called) to try to make some gains for eventual pursuit of PhD. Argument: If spouse gets PhD they will make more money and be in a better position, however 5K is just a drop in the bucket.

personalfinance,"Saved up 20k and planning on investing in real estate, am I ready?","Currently I work a job where I have no living expenses- I travel so I stay in company paid hotels and I get paid a generous per diem that I just put towards savings. My income varies by project, sometimes I make 50k a year, this year and next I'm booked through and will make around 65-70k. I haven't fallen below 40k since I graduated though. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only debts I have are from student loans totaling around 11k and from a car payment which is around 13k. Both have pretty good interest rates (below 3%), so I'm not inclined to touch them right now even if it would make me debt free. I use a credit card for everything, but I always pay it off at the end of the month, and my credit score right now is around 760. I do sometimes have to pay for health insurance, depending on which company I'm working for at the time, but I'm young and it's just for me so the price is pretty negligible. 

&amp;#x200B;

The companies I work for don't offer 401K plans so this is sort of my own informal way of investing and growing my money. I do want to diversify my assets, but I also think I'm on a short timeline for the area before the housing prices edge me out of the market. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped going out so much over the summer and because of my lack of living costs and picking up a lot of OT I've been able to put away around 20k that's just sitting around in my bank. What I'd like to do is purchase two houses (over the next 6mo-1yr) in my hometown area (one of the fastest growing cities in the US) that I can have a property management firm look after for me. I've compared mortgages, closing costs, insurance, appliances, etc compared to regional rental prices and it looks like I can still make 400-500 a month even with someone else looking after the property for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently my plan is to purchase the first home with 0% down since one of my banks offers competitive 0% down first time home buyer plans, and then purchase the second house 6mo-1yr after the first and put 10-20% down on that one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I prioritize being debt free over the potential creation of new sources of income 

In a rising stock market should is real estate the correct focus

personalfinance,Financing a Used Older Full Time Van Home,"Hello. I am a 23 year old recent college grad looking to make a used vehicle purchase.

The vehicle is a 1999 Chevy express 2500 van. It is professionally converted into a camper capable of living in full time. It has 110,000 miles on chassis with a brand new engine and trans put in less than 5000 miles ago. Two 100W solar panels with batteries , nice propane flat grill, electric fridge and sink, two very nice roof fans, extendable canopy/ roof rack, very nice wood finishing. $10,000 from a private seller.    Fully set up to live in full time with very little work.

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $6500 right now saved. I could maybe scrape another $1500 from my  various savings but it would leave not a huge emergency fund (around $800) I would like to have a larger emergency fund especially as I make this transition to living in a van.   I spend roughly $400 a month on rent/ utilities (no lease), and currently trying to bring down my excess spending but my credit card is $700-$1000 a month depending on how much I eat and drink out with the girlfriend (this also includes gas, groceries and my hobbies) I net around 1,600 a month, working for a university. I am in the environmental science/ GIS field being way underpaid but I like my job, that being said I am actively searching for new work, but also taking free college classes towards a masters + extra certificates, its extremely reasonable I double or even triple this income within the next few years.  I do some under the table side work for a friend, currently $200 a month but I have been without vehicle so several months limiting this work, I could side-hustle hard for a few months and rake in another $1000/mo if I need to.    I currently have no debt, never have, the idea slightly terrifies me.  I have a decent credit score (740) mostly just from paying my credit cards on time every month, paying a debt would help this yes?

I am struggling trying to think of how pay for the rest of this. typical auto loans are no good given the vehicle is almost 20 years old.  I can maybe ask my well off parents to help me finicane the rest, but they have already given me a decent chunk of that $6500 and it would hurt my feeling of independence even more, something I value. I am seeing some online credit unions offer a used older car finance option with decent interest rates (3.5-6?) Specially I am looking at PenFed when it looks like I can loan the remaining cash for right at 3.5% for 36 mo (calculator says this is under $200 interest?) Is this wise. I think giving up the rent and living more frugal I could pay it off in much under that time frame.  I don't budget a whole lot, most just try to make frugal spending choices (although I think I'm doing alright for being 23 years old, I have a small retirement fund started) maybe this whole process will force me to take a harder look at following a more outlined budget.   Is it crazy unwise to jump into this debt for a older van, even though It will also become a small home I would soon own?    After I pay it off I could see myself moving in somewhere and keeping it as a weekender kinda rig.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be able to pay all my own cash up front but this vehicle to me seems too good of a perfect fit to pass up given my currently lifestyle. Plus being without a vehicle for the past half year I am really itching to have some of that freedom back.  I know I would be alot happier living in it. (I really wish my last vehicle want such money pit, wasted $2500 trying to repair it during the last few months) I have very active outdoor hobbies (climbing/ whitewater kayaking), go camping every weekend, I currently bike around town alot, so I think I will fit into the van life no problem. I have access to a private shower and washer/drier at my office (its an awesome small lab tucked into the corner of campus) and I even think I could park there several days a week, as well as a gym membership.  I have friends and girlfriend in surrounding towns who would help support me as I settle into the van lifestyle (mostly storing some of my camping gear and occasional parking) I am aware some spending may go up with the van lifestyle, for one gas, also I live in north GA cost of living is low, temperatures are friendly to car living, older vehicle would be less susceptible to rust issues.   Can you guys give me some guidance or affirmation I making a smart move here?    thanks for taking the time to read this :)

Quick breakdown of my income: Agreed to a rate of $24/hour and consistently working 40 hours/week. This comes out to $4160/month if you extend that over a full year ($24 x 40 hours x 52 weeks / 12 months). I am really looking for input on how much I should be saving for taxes each month. I know I am responsible for SE tax of \~15% + Federal tax + State tax (California for reference). Whats a good percentage to shoot for? 25%? Also, I am vaguely aware that filing quarterly is a thing but have no idea if I am liable for that. 

I've read the wiki and looked online for tax calculators but it all seemed so convoluted I don't know know where to start.

gaming,Game concepts/models you enjoy that don't get frequently used.,"I really like the game model where you play through a game story or campaign that's rather short but things carry over to the next play through and or you unlock new paths/stories, or you just have pure knowledge of events that makes the next playthrough different. 

Its not really rouge like but its more like a situation where a game isn't 40 hours long, and is meant to be played multiple times. 

Some examples of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Way of the Samurai- been a long time since I played it but it had a short story (maybe a few hours) but different things would happen at different times of day and you kept playing to interact with them all and get the full picture of what was going on.

personalfinance,Debt Settlement Option - Simple Path,"Hello All  


I am considering using Simple Path Financial for restructuring my debt.  I currently have a few personal loans and credits cards (from hard times the last 2 years) totalling approx. $27K and altogether cost me $1100/mo.  Also, my credit score is not great and just over 600  


I can afford the $1100/ mo but with the high interest rates, little is going to the principle so I reached out to Simple Path for a personal loan which they of course cannot do and made it clear the are a debt settlement company.  


They are saying they can save me about $20K, and lower my monthly pmt to $420 for 48 mos, I would of course prefer to pay $800ish and knock it out.  They require you to not pay on these accounts and within 90 days they settle a new principle, my credit score would take a big hit, but supposedly after about 6 mos it begins recovering.  


My concern is the negative impact and long term implications with this route and how long the recovery takes.  Does anyone have experience with this option and can shed a bit of light? Actual examples would be greatly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Starting off on the right foot.,"I’m currently a freshman in college, vaguely employed-I work at a job back home over breaks. I have a couple job prospects at school, including an upcoming interview, for a job that’s about $12 an hour plus commission. It’s almost secured at this point, I should be working by the start of next semester. 

I’m paying for most of my college through my scholarships and federal loans, plus some from my college fund. I pay about $10k in tuition, and then about $15k in room and board. My $6k scholarship would cover most of my tuition, and my federal loans would more than cover the rest. 

I’m hoping to move off campus next year to reduce those costs, because I just can’t justify living in a dorm that costs almost $1k a month. 

I’m in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, so living expenses aren’t crazy high. I’ve done the math, and I figure that with my job I can budget about $500-600 in rent (moving in with my SO) $100 a month in gas and maintenance (car is already paid off), $200 in various utilities (electric, internet, phone), and then have about $100 for savings and $200 for food and entertainment. 

I’m planning on getting a secured credit card as soon as I start working, using that for daily expenses and keeping it paid off every month so I don’t accrue any debt, and hopefully start building credit. I can’t expect any help from my parents, they’ve filed bankruptcy and have terrible credit. 

TLDR; Working on moving off campus to save money, any advice on how to get a good start financially would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Is it possible to contribute TOO much to pretax 401k? Alternatives?,"Hey everyone, new here...

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty self explanatory with the title, was looking for input. Was not sure if there is an equilibrium point where the having liquid funds would be more beneficial once I got to a certain % pretax contribution (i.e. once you're contributing at/over X% income pretax, liquidity in an active account while paying tax upfront may be more beneficial than additional contributions). I am currently contributing 12% per period and was considering maxing that out (40% of gross paycheck), when this question gave me pause. 

&amp;#x200B;

For some background:

24 y/o Accountant Boston, MA 

\~$68,500/yr income (salary + bonus)

\~24% Effective Tax Rate (Fed + State)

Company matches $0.25 per $1 on up to 6% of pretax contributions 

\~$32k Liquid assets

\~$5.5k Roth assets

\~$6k Pretax (401k) assets

No student loans

&amp;#x200B;

Am I seriously overthinking things? I have an adequate emergency fund. I will prioritize maximizing Roth contributions before pretax. Currently, my liquid assets have just been sitting as cash while I try to plan/hunt for investing opportunities (discussion for another day).

gaming,Game idea! Round/horde survival game called ‘These Damn Elves’,"—The idea: 
Santa’s elves are tired of the slave labor they endure to make all of the toys every year. This Christmas they’re taking it back to Santa. 

—The narrative: 
You play as Santa Clause who must defend himself against the onslaught of elves that come in these endless waves, using a ‘round’ system.

—Online: 
Online you can play in a group of 1-4 players and survive together. You can either be: Santa, Mrs. Clause, The “Grouch” (grinch knockoff), or Yukon Cornelius (from Rudolph).

—Mechanics: 
This will be a 3D soft-rendered type game. You survive as many ‘rounds’ as you can. Santa will be able to defeat the elves with his bare hands, but at the end of every round he can go to his sack of presents and use elf souls to purchase new weapons (sharpened candy-cane throwing knives, etc.), or purchase upgrades. 

—Game modes: 
For now I have 2 game mode ideas: One is a classic horde/round survival with Santa just by himself in sort of an enclosed ice area where the Enemies will come out of various crevices or caves. The second is where Santa has to defend the workshop, the enemies will be attacking it, but also indirectly Santa. He will be able to set traps around the workshop, and using elf souls he can buy different traps or upgrade defenses. 

—Playable Characters: 
-Santa Clause: this will not be the ‘Jolly’ Santa model. He will be a sort of comically buffed up version able to throw elves around. He will be complete with Santa hat, a sleeveless Santa coat, and tactical Santa pants with combat boots. He is strong and has abilities matching his strength (e.g. able to pick up and throw elves). 

-Mrs. Clause: Big fat old woman with rosy cheeks. She cusses up a storm; she’s so pissed at these elves. Her abilities are to be able to craft certain traps, (e.g. cookie bombs), once her meter fills up for that craftable. 

-The ‘Grouch’: The grouch is a furry, colored creature who has a lanky stature while wearing tattered Christmas gear. He is very agile and cunning; able to do evasive maneuvers, and turn some elves against each other. 

-Yukon Cornelius: A strong dwarf type character; he has a flannel lumberjack look. He is equipped with a pickaxe and is able to make quick work of low-level elves. 

—Enemy NPCs: 
-Elves: there are several types of elves that will be amongst the horde. There are: the low-level keebler-type elves (about 2 foot tall, not much of a threat, but there are many), the fudge-packers, (tank like elves that got fat as fuck off of cookies), the buffies, (elves that followed Santa’s workout regimen and are about twice as tall as low level elves and buff as fuck, able to throw lower elves into battle).

-Reindeer: 
All of Santa’s reindeer have been recruited by the elves to turn against Santa. They come as bosses every 5 waves or so; able to fly around and dive-bomb Santa. Once killed they drop max ammo and refill all abilities/health. The only reindeer that is not an enemy is Rudolph, he is able to be used as a purchase with elf souls and can help turn the tide against the horde (non-playable). 

-Snowmen/Snowcreatures:
These are evil snowmen created by the elves with their magical crafting powers. Most snowmen are normal and move at a very slow pace towards Santa (acting as more of a shield for the elves), others are snow creatures (created with big branches from trees and can be a tough challenge). 

-Krampus: A goat-like demon creature that is a Santa abomination. He wears darker and tattered Santa gear. He comes as a boss that cannot be killed but goes away by giving him elf souls.

-Gingerbread men: Little gingerbread cookies that can stealthily move about and cause havoc to the player (able to pile up and hold down the player to get attacked by other enemies).

—Market/sales:
This will be kind of a niche market during the holiday season, but can be converted to other titles for the other seasons (e.g. Halloween). Game will be Gory, with Mature content such as foul language and blood. Targeted demographic will be late teens/early adults. 

Let me know what you guys think! I came up with this today after watching the new Grinch movie oddly enough, LOL.

Bitcoin,Why Mass Adoption is Inevitable,"It started as merely an internet toy created anonymously at the amusement of a small group of cypherpunks.

The brilliant technology speaks for itself, and like any other new tech, quickly made a small group of computer programmers and early adapters incredibly wealthy.  Global media outlets take note.

It’s quickly brushed off by Wall Street and Silicon Valley as a ponzi scheme, or better yet, the “Myspace” of Blockchain technology.

With this newly minted buzz word “Blockchain” tons of programmers, entrepreneurs, students, and scammers jump on the hype train. We see thousands of new and “revolutionary” cryptocurrencies all claiming to be superior to bitcoin.

Many of which lack the basic fundamental qualities needed including decentralization, security, credibility of monetary policy, immutability, distribution, infrastructure, and more.

Attracting a large number of unproven and inexperienced founders, CEOs, and first time entrepreneurs the majority of these new projects lack the experience to follow through with their promises to investors.

Retail, VC, and HFs jump in before regulations are set lacking the necessary understanding of this new industry and monetary policy creating a completely bogus evaluation model in the process.

An enormous amount of investment pours into these scams creating even more noise and confusion. A few of these projects are able to outperform Bitcoin in the short-term picking up strong followings in the process.

Eventually credible teams are assembled attracting established VCs with giant discounts buying new coins at bulk, creating even more hype, only to later be dumped on the retail market.

After an unexplainable bull market on these alternative coins the community is forced to sit back and watch as every project fails to deliver on each and every promise they made to the crowd. In the process creating zero unique use-cases and wiping out most of the newly created value, further exposing the endless flaws with the new properties, technologies, and the inexperienced entrepreneurs running them.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin, remains constant and retains its value over the long run establishing even more mainstream credibility as these alternative coins disappear.

People, left burned in the “alt coin” craze, witness and learn first hand about Bitcoin’s superiority across all characteristics.

Right before and even during the next phase of rebooted blockchain projects spurring another bull market, Bitcoin’s unshakable and anti-fragile record exacerbates the chronic fear of missing out.

This next go around Bitcoin is clearly established as the standard in which all other cryptocurrencies will be judged.

As the years go by hyper inflating fiat currencies across the globe further contribute to the slow grow of Bitcoin becoming a great means of securely preserving wealth.

High net-worth individuals and Investors are convinced to allocate a portion (0.25% – 7.50%) of their portfolio into Bitcoin to capture and hedge against future growth, as well as increase Sharpe ratio of their traditional portfolios.

Extreme speculation facilitates and “speculative attack” on “stable” currencies as the increase in demand for Bitcoin necessarily involves a reduction in demand for fiat causing higher than expected fiat inflation. (See Pierre Rochard article here)

Attempting to adapt Central Banks finally give in and start to accumulate Bitcoin, somewhat like they do with Gold today. This causes the most legitimate bull run to date.

As we watch the market cap grow beyond the ~5-10 trillion range we fully acknowledge that one of the greatest monetary wealth transfers of our time has occurred.

Early adapters, investors, developers, and miners now begin to actually spend their Bitcoins at will on everything from real estate to bubble gum.

The short term daily volatility begins to subside.

Global demand to be paid in Bitcoin increases as more people are able to work freely from anywhere and businesses have fully accepted the ease and security of Bitcoin.

At this point Bitcoin can now be considered as a legitimate medium of exchange worldwide. Increasingly being used by corporations, banks, and governments as a legit unit of exchange.

Due to the emergence of a superior, deflationary, new monetary standard, people increasingly store their personal wealth in Bitcoin rather than fiat.

Central Banks power is ever so slightly reduced and previous local monopolies on money are described as a thing of the past.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Advice for my mom - 7 years to retirement - Cash 401k to pay high interest CC?,"Hi there,  


Looking for some perspective on a decision my mom is asking me about. She recently quit her job. She has about $25k in her 401k. She never contributed to it much, and has been very poor with personal finance her whole life. She has about $15k in credit card debt across several cards, with interest rates ranging from 24%-29%.   


She's considering cashing out her 401k to pay those off before they accumulate any more. I know conventional wisdom is not to touch your 401k unless absolutely necessary, but she's only about 7 years off retirement. Her job prospects are not going to be much above minimum wage. Am I wrong in thinking cashing that out, even with the penalty and taxes, is going to result in a better use of the money over the next 7 years? With interest rates that high, and very little ability to add to the 401k over the next few years, I don't see an advantage to keeping it rolling until retirement.   


Personally I don't have a great knowledge of retirement funds. I'm doing alright myself, but I have only ever worked freelance post-college. I have a good savings account stashed, but I haven't dealt with retirement funds yet (a battle for another day).  


Any insight you guys can give would be greatly appreciated!

I don't want to be spending my time with scammers trying to steal from me or having to worry about psychos tracking my location down to steal my bitcoins.

But I digress. Please post any helpful tips/suggestions especially on where to start for a noob such as my self.

personalfinance,Best/most efficient way to save up for two trips overseas?,"\[Sorry if this isn't the right board for this question. If anything, please let me know and I'll move it.\]

I'm 25, a recent uni graduate and am back home after studying overseas for five years. I'm working at my first full time job (I worked part time stuff in the past during vacation from school), but I still do lots of part time work and ""side hustles"" on the weekends, or at night. I don't earn very much from either my main job or my side hustles, but I always try to put a portion of it in a bank account that I don't touch. I don't overspend, and I cut back where I can, but I do like to treat myself to a nice meal or a new piece of clothing every once in a while. In my country (Barbados), the cost of living is very high, so saving is not easy.

My boyfriend and I were planning on visiting his grandmother in England in 2019, and we were planning on making a whole trip out of it - we would go visit relatives in England, Scotland and Portugal. we both started saving money for that, however one of my closest friends just got engaged in Brazil, and wants to get married next year, and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I spoke to my boyfriend about it, and he wants to go as well, as he's never met my Brazilian friend in person. (I lived/studied in Brazil, hence the connection) He also wants to go as he wants to see where I lived and studied, and meet my friends down there.

So we decided that it would be best to postpone the England trip until 2020, and that we would do a Brazil one in 2019 instead. There are some cities down there that I know he'd like and I'd like to visit again, and the exchange rate between the currencies would be very favourable for us. The biggest killer will be the airfare (about $1500 US per person. Barbados' currency is tied 1:2 to the US dollar, so that's twice as expensive)

Basically what I'm asking is what is the best way to save for my trip next year? My initial plan was to save up money for the trip in cash, and then have my mom pay for my airfare on her card, so that she can get miles from the purchase, and I could then pay her back in cash. But I want to know if that is the most efficient way to save, or if I should just deposit all of the cash that I've been saving onto my bank account, and withdraw it when the time comes to pay for the airfare? The bank interest rate here is terrible, 0.01%, plus there are monthly maintenance fees.

I'm also wondering if I should still put down some money for the England trip in 2020? I don't want to have to completely start over from zero when I come back from Brazil. I literally have two jars on my bedside table, one for each trip, and I've been putting money in both. 

I also have a saving scheme where I've been saving any $10 bills that I come into contact with and I've been saving them in a jar for the whole of this year. I must be close to about $500 US in there right now ($1000 BDS, my currency). It's a nice little way to save money without cutting into my regular budget

Any advice on the most efficient way to save for something like this? I'm still a beginner at learning about personal finance, but I am interested in saving in the most efficient way possible.

That said, I had a real employment rough patch a few years back, and our credit got demolished. We need to buy a car, and it looks like we're going to have an astronomical interest rate due to my credit score being in the low-mid 400s. In the last year or so, we've finally gotten on top of things, and I'm wondering whether I can/how to go about repairing my credit without touching the inheritance, or if accessing some amount of it would be useful/worth it in fixing credit.

Around the time we bought the house and I lost a job and had a kid, it got maxed out and then cancelled. The issuing bank somehow gave it to ""collections"", but it's not technically collections(? so they said, and I don't have anything listed in collection on my credit report) because the company handling it doesn't charge any interest. They wanted a certain amount paid per month, which I couldn't swing at the time, so they agreed to temporarily let me pay a lower (around $200) monthly rate. After 16 months of that (around Feb of 2018), they called me and said we needed to up the payment. I said I'd have to see what I could do and would get back to them. I never did, and they just stopped taking payments from me (it had been automatic withdraw) and the balance owed currently stands at $14,063.

So, obviously as for ""1"", I need to keep up making on-time mortgage payments. ""2"", nothing I can do, the car is long since paid off. ""3"", if I call the not-a-collector back up and get back on a payment plan for the cancelled credit card, will my credit improve? How quickly? Would just paying the debt off with some of the inheritance instantly/tremendously improve my credit? Again, we'd really rather not touch the inheritance, but we are getting close to having to buy a new car, and it seems short-sighted to pay a 17% interest rate just to have the liquid assets?

Also, for what it's worth, I make about $50,000/year, my wife does some side gigs that net maybe $5k/year, I'm early 30s and live in Upstate NY.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"""wex.nz"" aka ""btc-e.com"" one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges exit scammed today.","So after [btc-e.com](https://btc-e.com) got busted by the feds last year they released a token for every fair they had listed.

&amp;#x200B;

For example: if you had 1BTC you then had 1BTCET that they promised to make pairty with BTC at one point to cover all the damages.

&amp;#x200B;

But it appears they exit scammed again and nobody is gonna get anything. As many people know 1USD Tether was trading for 10 USD on this exchange because i think it was apparently the only thing you could withdrawl for some reason.

&amp;#x200B;

I always, because i loved btc-e so much back in the day, kept enough money to be able to write in the trollbox.. over the last year i didnt even use it but i didnt send that money out ever... also because i had it all in their trash tokens and had a sell order at 1:1.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to know if there is a lawsuit against them or if there is anyway to ever see that money again. Apparantly they sent most of the money to binance.. so people are begging binance to give it back to them.

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing Disaster!!!!!,"This has been 4 months of nonsense and I need help.  I have been on the phone 17 times, for over 10 hours, working through 1 pesky loan.  Here's the background.  I have an image to help illustrate.  Bear with me, it is a long an un-necessarily confusing excursion and I am stuck.  My original loans are through Fedloan servicing and they have not returned calls, not assigned a single point of contact, and also say that supervisors cannot be spoken to directly.  They return calls within 2 business days (which they didn't).  I do not know what to do and have stopped paying this loan because they have now lost about $1000 in payments.  Helpppppppp please :(

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

**July 2018** \- I had 6 loans between grad school and undergrad.  5/6 still open and the balance was $35543.  $30,998 had a rate of 6.8 spread between 4 loans.  1 for 4555 was at 3.4

**August 2018**: refinanced the 4 loans at 6.8 for a better rate (4.49) through Common Bond / First Mark Services (3rd party).  Continued to make weekly payments to

**Sep 8 2018**: noticed Fedloan mistakingly fairshared the 4 separate checks to all of my accounts, so now i have 6 accounts open across 2 organizations.  It should be 2 total - 1 with Common bond at the 4.49 rate and 1 at Fedloan at the 3.4 rate.  Spoke on a conference call with all 3 organizations together.  Went check by check through.  Was told it would take 2 weeks to process.  Fedloan misapplied the amounts

**Oct 2018**: this month was crazy.  They took 4 weeks to process and it was still wrong.  In the meantime, I had went ahead and paid off one of the loans on my own because it was so late.  Once the weekend was done, I had credits to 3 accounts, the 3.4 was still somewhat right, but I had over 10K in one 6.8 appear over night.  By this time, I had already made 7 calls to reps and it was not resolved.  I received the escalation, Brandon, who gave me a direct line.  He largely fixed the problem so at least I didn't have thousands in credits and thousands in 1 6.8 account.  He said it would be processed the next week to completely fix and also apply credits for the interest accrued.  Brandon reset to August but I had paid since August, so I still had credits left in 4 accounts, plus 1 account with $70 owed???? what the heck...

&amp;#x200B;

**Nov 2018**: Brandon has still never returned a call or answer the phone... other esclations I spoke with were apparently at a site with a different system that did not allow for direct extensions so I was stuck with Brandon... On Nov 15 all seemed right with the world.  I spoke with a guy named Colin who said that they were issuing a credit to the other institution for overpayment back in August and they were completing applying the $1290 credit to my 3.4.  Still had that weird account with $70 due but I just let it go.... all seems well...minus the drop 4 points in my credit score from this garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

Except I got a notice today and now I have credits in all of my accounts again, but that $70 account is now at 0.  I still have a balance of $3700 in the 3.4 which should be $2500.  What is going on!?!?!?!  There is no escalation path at Fedloan and I have been on the phone over 10 hours and have made 10 calls.  What to do????

personalfinance,How long does it take to fix a bad credit score?,"Hello everyone. I’m a 22 year old college student and live in Ohio. The last few years of really bad spending habits have left me in a really bad financial position and I racked up about $4500 in credit card debt. That’s about 80-90% utilization. I realized how badly it was affecting my credit when I checked and I was down to a score of 619. I’m making a $900 payment this month, and plan to pay around $550 a month or more until it’s all paid off, I hope to have it all paid off by June. I’m able to do this because I use grant money to pay for my monthly expenses and am just putting any new income that I earn from working towards this debt. My question is how long after these are all paid off will I start to see my credit increasing? How long until I’m back around a score of 700+? I graduate in a year and a half and need to be able to rent without a co-signer and get a newer car. I have no clue how fast credit scores are able to rise, but once I have these paid off I plan to freeze all of the cards with an interest rate and only use the one with no interest rate for the any unexpected emergency costs, so assume that I keep my utilization around 10-15%. Also, don’t know if this makes a difference, but I make all payments on time and have nothing else that’s considered bad on my credit report.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Rational conversation on the following perspective welcome- future of crypto,"Just read an excellent post from BitcoinMarkets a few weeks ago which is worth sharing imho:

When BTCUSD's price action is boring as sin, it's a great time to think about macro trends and our long-term strategies. I think oftentimes we get lost in the action of the moment, and neglect to step back and take a wider view of markets. Hopefully this post is interesting in light of that.

I know I'm sporting a bear flair right now, but at my core, I'm a Bitcoin bull. I think most people here are, and I think our reasoning for being so is incredibly sound.

Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, world markets have been running through no man's land - a time of unprecedented central bank intervention. The reasoning was simple - the credit freeze spooked the fuck out of every business the world over, and made them paranoid and extremely risk-averse. To combat this, the Fed injected tons of money into the market ecosystem via TARP and the various QEs, intending to make the market environment seem safer and convince businesses to take on greater risks (risk-taking, of course, being the engine of economic growth). On the surface, this worked brilliantly. We've experienced a precedent-shattering bull market, unemployment rates reached historic lows, etc. But if you dig a little deeper, I think this intervention actually completely and utterly failed. Let's analyze what has ACTUALLY happened in major markets over the last ten years. Businesses, still shell-shocked from 2008, seem to have taken safe and easy routes to make money post-2008 - via things like stock buybacks, M&amp;A consolidation activity, etc. Companies were able to buy the outward signs of growth in the easy-money, zero interest rate economy, boosting their share prices easily while not taking on much risk at all. In this way, Fed policy failed - it did generate nominal returns as stock prices went up, but risk-taking behavior actually seems to have gone DOWN. Capital seeking greater returns than the passive growth of the whole economy was forced to look for bigger returns by chasing tech startups, real estate, and riskier niche assets like crypto. There was more money chasing big returns than there were things actually worth those big returns, which left us with wonders like Juicero, the venture-backed wi-fi juicer company, the California housing crisis, and utterly useless, exit-scamming shitcoins like Oyster Pearl, respectively. Right now that very same risk-seeking capital is LOVING weed stocks, which are in the process of topping out right now, so check out r/weedstocks for some cheap laughs. TL;DR: The Fed's low interest rate policies did not create sustainable risk taking or long term growth. They just fueled market consolidation via balance sheets getting bigger, and sent capital on the fringes into weird corners of world markets, where it inflated all kinds of fun bubbles (crypto included).

Now, the Fed is raising rates, the ECB is playing chicken with Italy, and the US &amp; China are engaged in a pissing contest over balance of trade. Each of these three are all spooky things that could cause a recession. As we watch US equities markets correct, any one of these dams could burst and become the catalyst that brings markets down. Rate raises could easily kill off some of the US's ""flagship"" companies - Sears recently filed for bankruptcy and GE is looking dangerously close too. In Europe, the populist Matteo government is threatening a repeat of the 2012 Greece crisis - but Italy is in a LOT stronger position than Greece ever was, making the outcome possibly dangerous enough to the Eurozone to spark an international crisis. Add the specter of Brexit and the really shaky foundations of Deutsche Bank to the mix, and you have a tinderbox waiting for a match. And don't even get me started on the US v China trade war - imagine the absolute chaos that would happen if the PRC manipulated the yuan in an ""unfriendly"" direction. The Chinese government is a real whale with real power, and they could dump their US Treasuries too to add insult to injury and ruin one of the biggest safe haven assets the world financial system depends on. TL;DR: There are three really big, somewhat probable ""catalyst"" events that could send world markets into a nosedive.

The really insidious thing about all of this is that the central bank emperor no longer has any clothes. If unprecedented intervention doesn't prevent the next crisis (or worse, creates an even NASTIER crisis than 2008), it's quite possible that the faith in central banking as a cure-all for crises will be shaken or totally undermined. I'm of the opinion that all that injected capital didn't make our markets stronger - it just subsidized risk-averse behavior and didn't adequately penalize companies for their lack of risk taking. It created paper growth (inflation) and not real growth. Laughably, it also subsidized the creation of never-profitable behemoth companies like Uber, so it'll be interesting to see how those companies end up in a time of crisis. TL;DR: The Fed inflated the USD roughly 17% over the period 2008-2018, for minimal (if any) gains in market strength.

And that's where Bitcoin comes in.

When the markets finally do get rekt after their 10+ year artificial inflationary orgy, it's possible that people will wake up to the fact that we live in inflationland. The illusion of stability and safety will be shattered once again, as will the illusion that central banks can do anything to control or ""tame"" the inherent wildness of markets. Consequently, it's possible that people will lose faith in the greenback as the de facto global arbiter of value in this scenario. It's not going to be easy to watch paper ETF gains melt away while companies nominally beat earnings, or watch long term bond holdings start trading way below par. The defeat of the ""central banks are all-powerful"" narrative will send shockwaves through global markets, which will realize that no one is in control. Bitcoiners have been adjusting to the realities of a system where no one is in control for some time now, so they'll have a head start. TL;DR: When markets get rekt, everyone will realize that central banks are just whales, after all. They make waves, but they don't make the ocean.

Bitcoin (and probably a handful of other non-inflationary cryptos) will benefit the most from this scenario if it happens. An inflationary world where no major currency can be trusted to hold its value long-term will send money scrambling for things with fixed or limited supplies. Precious metals and other commodities will probably also benefit in this environment, as people re-configure their investments to be as close to tangible assets and cash flows as possible. The tail risk of being financially ruined in an inflationary world is worth hedging against, and remains my dominant reason for holding 10% of my net worth in crypto at this time. I assume many of you folks believe the same.

Whether you're here to hedge against the inflationpocalypse or just to get rich, I wish you all the best of luck in acquiring as many BTC as possible. It's a long road ahead.

Onward.

personalfinance,To 401k or not to 401k?,"Hey all, first time post on r/personalfinance. A little background: I'm 26, I work as a Federal Contractor and I just switched jobs from one contractor to another. I was previously with a company for 23 months, and had contributed \~$4k of my own money into a matched plan. Of course I left about a month before I hit 25% vested interest, and therefore I don't get to keep any of the matched contributions over the past 2 years. I need some advice on what I should do with this money that I put into my old 401k plan, which I now need to rollover.

From what I can tell, a 401k is not very useful if you're not planning on sticking with an employer in the long-term. I actually ended up losing $500 over 2 years on my previous 401k, and now I have the option to roll it over into my new employer's plan, but I'm at a loss to if there is any point at all. My new employer does not match, they offer $2.65/hour which can be split any way I choose between a 401k, an HSA or toward my health insurance plan (\~$70/month). I should also add, I do not plan to stay with this employer in the long-run. Again, this is another government contracting position, and I hope to use the experience to move onto a better paying job in about 2 years for a tech company outside of government. There is no upward mobility with this new position I have, it's locked into a very specific role on the contract and I can pretty much only expect \~1-3% cost of living increases and not much else. 

With that in mind, I'm never going to be vested with this new company either. Should I bother rolling my only 401k into a new one? Should I even bother having my new employer contribute to a new 401k plan, or should I take that $2.65/hour and use it for health insurance, skip a 401k until I land somewhere with some long-term feasibility, and use the money to invest somewhere else?

investing,I have overestimated my risk tolerance.,"34 years old, invested an unexpected windfall (about 5 times yearly income) all at once in May 2018. Was up 5 % in August, now down 8% in total. Looking at percentages, this is nothing to go crazy about. But looking at the actual numbers, I keep thinking 'I have lost a year's worth of savings', 'I'm losing money faster than I can save', etc.

I haven't changed anything in my portfolio. Done what you're generally supposed to, picked a strategy and sticked with it. All I can say is, this goes not without serious stress, and you can't really anticipate your actual risk tolerance until you are forced to test it.

**I think this is generally not appreciated enough on this sub** (and r/personalfinance likewise)**;** knowing your personal risk tolerance, while being extremely important when setting your investment strategy, not only depends on your age and income situation, but also on the amount of money you have in relation to what you can save from your income. I am by all means in a healthy position financially, but I'll admit it; I felt less concerned about money before I got the windfall.

EDIT; Wow, I really didn't expect such traction! Some very interesting comments, and definitely a good relief for my troubled mind. I realise some personal background info is missing which I'll give below, but perhaps I'll clarify my point first: besides age, general situation, living cost and anticipated expenses, simply the amount of investment can be (and sure is for me) a determinating factor for risk rolerance, which is not often talked about. If my portfolio consisted only of my personal savings, I would laugh at even a 15% decline. But if your stash suddenly includes your late uncle's life savings too, we may have more fear of fucking up because we can't just make up for the losses with savings in the same time frame. In other words, if you win the lottery, or if you look at the same amount after saving it up in a shit job for 10 years, would your strategy be the same? General wisdom tells us to be riskier with assets we don't really need, but our brain likely tells us the opposite..

In my case, the portfolio is around 80/20 equities/bonds, well diversifed over growth/value and sectors through different funds (yes, some actively managed, but that's another discussion) and etfs. It is definitely not as well diversified geographically, which I might change at some point, but ironically that's what's limited my losses in the past weeks.
I have no dependables, no debt, and won't need the money for at least 5 years. In other words, I'm confident my strategy fits my needs, but have yet to get to terms with temporary downturns..",finance

personalfinance,Trying to target high-interest rate loans by selecting longer repayment plan/lower monthly payment,"Hello all, I've posted here before and know I need to target my higher interest loans first (avalanche) to pay the least in the end. I was told by loan vendor my monthly payment amount is $825 on the standard 10-year repayment plan (75k balance / 6 years BA/MA). Not ideal, but I can't currently put more towards it with our household income (78k).

Anywho, I went to make my first payment and it took my $825 and that apparently was the collective minimums on each loan, so I couldn't target the high-interest loans like I wanted to. I called the customer service line to see what my options were, and the loan advisor said if I want to target high-interest loans first with my $825 to select a repayment plan that gives me the lowest monthly payment, and just take the extra money and target it with that. Lowest monthly payment option is $350/mo, giving me $475 to target high-interest loans with.

Does this sound like my best option? Attached specifics for each loan (all through one vendor, thank the lawddd) here:

     I need some outside judgement. If that outside judgement could be you, I'd appreciate it.
     First and foremost, I just accepted a new position/raise with my current employer which pays $60,000/yr salary. The commute to the new office is approximately 35 minutes away as well. I start December 3rd. My girlfriend just bought a car, we're both still in school and she ended up with a 17.7% interest rate. Ouch. Just some background.
     I have a 96 GMC truck (185,000 mi), and my transmission is completely screwed. Went to multiple shops for diagnostic and they all say the same thing. Replace the whole damn thing. Bad timing. 1900 is the estimate I was given.
     This leaves me with a tough choice. I will be right on the edge of having the means to fix this on Friday (My emergency fund + current pay) because I just spent everything else on Christmas gifts figuring I would get prepared early. 


Option 1: Fix vehicle, dish out $2,000. It's old and high mileage so no guaruntee as to how long I'll have it. Greater spending on gas to get to my new job and riskier for something to go wrong. But less overall spending (hopefully)

Option 2: Get rid of it. Get a reliable used vehicle. Deal with a potentially high interest rate, but be responsible paying it off. Better gas mileage, but potentially jumping the gun on getting a new vehicle.

I will be making quite a bit more money at this new position, and one of my medical bills that I budget each month ($110) is over in December, so I can afford it. But I don't know if it's best. I was already considering getting a new vehicle, but I don't want to be overly hasty.

TLDR; Fix old gas guzzling vehicle at 184,000mi for $2000 before starting new position 40 minutes away or get a reliable used vehicle and pay off asap?

financialindependence,A Quick Tax Lesson &amp; Reasoning for Roth vs Traditional,"I have responded to a lot of questions in this sub about this so lets do the math for 90% of us (those of us not making bay area and CEO salaries).

&amp;#x200B;

2018 (single) Key Tax Numbers

$12,000 - Standard Deduction

$0-$9,525 - This portion of your income is taxed at 10% totaling $952.50 in taxes if above this bracket.

$9,526-$38,700 - This portion of your income is taxed at 12% totaling $4,453.50 in taxes if above this bracket.

$38,701-$82,500 - This portion of your income is taxed at 22% totaling $14,089.50 in taxes if above this bracket.

$82,501-$157,500 - This portion of your income is taxed at 24% totaling $32,089.50 in taxes if above this bracket.

There are more brackets up to 37% but we will stop here since things can get funky after this.

&amp;#x200B;

The formula for figuring out what you pay in taxes this year is as follows:

Salary - Standard Deduction - Above the line deductions (see below) = Taxable income.

Above the line deductions include Traditional type retirement contributions, Health insurance, HSA/FSA, Student loan interest, Tuition, and more- you will have to figure out what yours are but those are the most common.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets do a scenario relevant to this sub:

Bob wants to know if he should do a Roth IRA or traditional.

Bob makes $60k Salary with a $10k bonus, his income is $70,000.

Bob takes the standard deduction because he rents an apartment and is in a low income tax state.

Bob contributed $18,500 to his 401k this year (Go bob!) and $1,500 in student loan interest. His insurance was another $2,000.

&amp;#x200B;

So plugging into the formula: $70,000-$12,000-($18,500+$1,500+$2,000)= $36,000 in taxable income

This puts Bob in the 12% bracket so he will owe ($36,000-$9,525)\*12% + $952.50 = $4,129.50 in federal tax.

Note: This is taken out of your paycheck already by payroll by default. If you paid in more than this, you get a refund at tax time and should look at claiming an extra exemption.

Now bob has some extra money and needs to decide if he is willing to pay taxes now for Roth IRA contributions or to defer taxes until later.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion: yes he should, he may even be better off contributing $2700 as Roth in his 401k if possible.

\- He is in the 12% bracket so money is only being taxed at that rate and (Personal Opinion) taxes are likely to go up

\- He is contributing a significant amount to his 401k so he will have taxable ""income"" in retirement. And maybe bob does something else for fun that brings in money during that time.

\- Roth is going to give him more flexibility on withdrawing large sums in 1 year. What if bob wants to buy a house, has a major emergency, or buy a fishing boat in retirement (I am totally not living vicariously through bob)

\- The real value of $5,500 Roth dollars is worth x% more than $5,500 in traditional dollars if you have the money to put in savings either way where x% is your marginal tax rate in retirement. I know this sub likes to take an idealistic view on this stuff but x% is probably not 0% all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Note 1: If your taxable income is above $38,700, traditional is almost certainly the better choice.

Note 2: You should also take into consideration state income/401k taxes if you plan on moving in retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

(Personal Opinion) I have read the marginal vs effective argument in the blogs and I believe that is not the correct stance to take. The last earned dollar is always going to be taxed at the marginal rate and if you have the opportunity to pretty much guarantee low taxes on income you should do it.  Worst case scenario you are out 12% on a small portion of your retirement money, best case the returns are much more.",finance

personalfinance,Is it “worth it” to buy a new car in my scenario?,"We need to buy our first car as we are getting our first little one. It would be used for daily commute (10miles/day) and dont expect to log more than 7k miles/year at most. We would pay cash. We have decent savings but I live frugally and dont want to overspend.

My initial target was a used car, reliable (corolla, prius,  honda), not too old (2014+) and with 40-80k miles. But all what i am finding is $12k+. The new Prius Prime (28.5k out of the door) has a 4.5k federal credit, 1.5k MA tax credit and Toyota is offering 3k cash back + 1.5k back if paying cash (deal expires Friday EOD). 

Although i sweared i would never buy a new car considering my driving patterns and car depreciation, i almost feel it would make sense to buy that car new with the warranty vs. a used one.

personalfinance,Switching back and forth between income-driven repayment and 30-year plan?,"This question is for people who are familiar with the income-driven repayment plans available for federal loans. 

I am a doctor in my first year out of med school. My current student loans are ~$150,000, and I currently make approximately $50,000 before taxes. My wife is in a different field and makes about $150,000/year. We have significant assets due to a windfall a few years ago (~$200,000) but have decided to not pay back the loans because in my specialty and geographic area, many practices, including government programs, will provide a certain amount of loan forgiveness per year as an incentive to work for them. Unfortunately, you usually cannot leverage the lack of having loans into a much higher salary, so it makes sense to hold onto loans even if you have the cash to pay for it. 

We currently are on a 30-year plan to pay the loans, which amount to about $1,000/month in payments.
We recently found out we are expecting a baby. My wife will likely take 6-12 months off of work. In our quest to keep our loan payments at a minimum, we are exploring the idea of switching to the REPAYE program when I am the only earner, which would drop out monthly payments to about $200. However, once she starts working again, REPAYE would require more than $1000/month, so I would want to switch back to the 30-year plan to keep paying only $1000/month. 

I can't find anything online about this type of strategy but I called my loan servicer and they said it would work. 

Am I missing anything? Are there any downsides to temporarily switching to REPAYE and then going back to a 30-year plan?",finance

Short version of the story is that he cut me out of everything, is still living in our house,  and thinks he's keeping everything because I'm the one who left. I've been left with no money for the past few months of being separate from him and with no money I can't get an attorney for getting my portion of our stuff. 

I recently found out that my grandmother (legal guardian growing up) took out 2 life insurance policies out on me when I was 1 year old. Each life insurance policy covers $10,000 and she has been paying for them monthly since I was 1 and I am 22 now. I'm really thinking about cashing in one of the insurance policies for the total value of the insurance. I would still have life insurance that covers $10,000 after cashing in the life insurance. 

The life insurance that I have is gerber life insurance and I know that I can cash it in, but I could also take a loan out on it. If you take a loan on one of them, your monthly bill goes up though and there is an interest rate of paying back the policy, if I read correctly. I also have no clue how cashing in a life insurance policy works. Would I cash it in for the full amount it covers or what?

I don't have major expenses or any debt, healthcare is free for me, and I drive a Honda Civic that I repair myself, including major engine work.

I've got a okay sum of money currently saved up ($30,000). By the end of next year, I'll have at least ($70,000) saved up, and the year after that, I'll have approximately ($100,000) saved up. I'm extremely fortunate and grateful to have guaranteed income. I've been budgeting for a year now, and everything is pretty consistent.

I live in a very cheap area (Texas), and some *modern* starter homes can range anywhere from $70-80k (about 10 years old) to about $100-120k (5-10 years old). If I take out a VA loan, I'd assume I'd get an interest rate of around 4% or so. Assuming the house I want to buy is $100k, if I to take out the loan next year, I'd put a downpayment of around 50k. That would leave 50k left on 4% a year or $2000+/year. About 2 years after that, I'd be able to fully pay off the house, along with $4,000 in interest.

economy,US Stocks Day Off: Markets Never Sleeps,"[Markets](https://www.fxpro.com/) diligently tried to defend their positions before the holidays in the USA. American indices had completed the trading on Wednesday almost unchanged, after losing about 4% in first two days of the week. The stocks of the energy sector companies had bounced off by 1-2% following the oil after a 6% plunge in the previous day.

American markets are closed on Thursday, and on Friday there is going to be a shortened trading session with a significant part of the players staying away from the trading. This had reinforced the focus on the trading dynamics in the first half of the week.

As we have noted earlier, despite the negative dynamics of the market favorites in previous months and years, market participants are far from panic. Index VIX has been traded near 20 for about a month, keeping its position despite the decline in shares.

&amp;#x200B;

The easing of the Fed's rhetoric last week has turned the dollar into decline, although this has not yet much affected the stock prices. The traders with shares are still afraid of possible problems with sales of the Apple stocks and are concerned about the exhaustion of the overall effect of tax reform on the economic growth.

The foreign exchange market is often the first to react on the changes in external conditions. And it has already given its verdict to the Fed’s sentiment, throwing away the dollar from the multi-month highs. The development of this trend will soften the market’s financial conditions, strengthening support for the shares.

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, the yield of the U.S. government bonds has been declining over the past two weeks. The yield of 10-years U.S. Treasuries had decreased from 3.25% to 3.06%. If at the initial stage this could be attributed to an increased demand for protective assets and was under the accompaniment of the dollar growth, the further yield decline (price growth) last week has related to the revision of the Fed’s policy expectations. 

Now it does not sound so unequivocally hawkish as in the start of October and that is also able to return the demand for stocks if this trend proves to be sustainable.

&amp;#x200B;

Following the decline in yield on the US debt market, the effect should soon emerge, which can seriously change the investor’s mood. Especially if the risks of the expanding trade wars and a sharp slowdown of the economy are not realized.",finance

financialindependence,"On cheese, board games and the long term efficacy of index investing","TL;DR: There is a board game called Cashflow developed by Robert Kiyosaki that is a good way of drilling in some of the FIRE concepts in a fun way. Focus is more on increasing income than decreasing expenses. Raises the point of whether time spent saving might be better spent on side gigs; also whether activist ‘investing’ in real estate or side business is better than indices in setting you up for post-FIRE opportunities.

 

ASIDE: I know Robert Kiyosaki has attracted his fair share of flak but I do still think that for a median income earner who is a bit more motivated and focused than average his whole process of moving from employee to self-employed to business owner is probably the only route to FatFIRE and in many ways a superior path to FIRE than salary and frugality. Obviously combining frugal living with any other strategy still gets you there fastest and gives you the most rope to see your ideas through, but I do think creative income maximization could maybe get a bit more attention than you see in YMOYL/ERE/MMM.

 

On to the Cashflow board game: My father was a small business owner who was a big Kiyosaki fan and got his boardgame, Cashflow, when I was around 13. I was not a fan at the time, given that whenever I had my friends over he would try to get us to play it. No one was really that interested since you have to balance your personal finances and invest sagely – for most people basically the worst part of your life. However the game does actually make it quite fun and in retrospect I wish some of my friends paid more attention.

 

Anyway some interesting points that the game raises:


 - You get given a career and set expenses at the start of the game, the aim being to use your savings and disposable income to generate passive investment greater than your expenses. At this point you exit the ‘rat race’ and enter the ‘fast track’. In the fast track you choose a ‘cheese’ at the start of the game – a 5 star holiday, large charitable donation etc. Once you can afford this you’ve won the game.
 - You cannot decrease your expenses but you quickly notice that a doctor with high disposable income but high expenses often has a tougher time getting out of the rat race than a janitor.
 - Investment is quite activist and real-estate focused. While I am by no means bullish on G10 property prices at the moment, I do think this is a valid path where spending 5-10hours per week can result in very good excess returns – ie learning how to find value, looking at and negotiating down on a lot of properties, Airbnb’ing it out yourself etc.
 - ‘Cheese’: This has become something of a joke in our family, when you want to justify a big ticket spending. I recently hit a FIRE milestone but probably will end up not buying the cheese because of meh. Its more about the chase than the reward. I do think this is a good system though, especially if you have a SO who is less on board with the frugal/hardworking life and need some material rewards along the way.
 - Fast Track: His point is that once you are out of the rat race, have several business interests and a lot of free time, your earning potential can really take off. I think this is a valid point often missed by the FIRE community, where the focus can sometimes be too focused on just getting away from a 9-5. Specifically, index investing gives you little to work with post-FIRE, whereas more activist side gigs can then possibly be leveraged into something with more upside.
 

Interested to hear thoughts on this last point – for myself, I think reflationary monetary policy has caused equities (and most listed instruments) to hit stretched valuations about 2years ago and have not invested much since then. I am rather keeping 80% of my savings since in very safe interest-bearing investments and invest the other 20% in risky startup-type investments, where upside is large and extra time spent and contacts made along the way can yield very good results. Case in point, I am busy exiting my first investment successfully for a 5x payout – by no means the norm but it is striking how much more enjoyable (and obviously easier) this has been than any other way of earning money.",finance

They introduce an extension of the spatial transformer network block. The new block interprets and normalizes 3D poses and self-occlusion. The rotation, translation, face model parameters in this block are learned unsupervised while training for simple geometric objectives.   
As an example, we show the texture maps produced by the network when images of Elon Musk are fed into it.

gaming,Is there any reason to keep buying digital for the Vita?,"Hey All. 

With the days going buy, my feelings towards the Nintendo Switch have been changing, and I’m really starting to consider getting one in the foreseeable future. One reason for this is that I’m getting the sense that it’s becoming everything that the Vita was meant to become, and at the same time I wonder if I should keep investing in a digital catalog for the Vita at this point. 

I feel it’s worth noting that I do already have about a dozen digital games on the Vita, mostly indie cross buys with the PS4 and a few PSX titles, so for that reason alone I’m very reluctant to let go of the system or admit that I made a poor investment. Still, with the systems future coming to a close, I’m thinking if it’s worth putting any further investment in. 

Im also pondering over a few factors that got me thinking about this in the first place: 

-Most PSX and PSP titles can be emulated in the computer, which I only just recently learned. 

-No signs of a Handheld in Sony’s future, so digital Vita games aren’t likely to be ported to any future consoles

-Physical cartridges just keep getting more expensive

-No future games for the Vita’s library outside of indie games, which have better odds of being future proofed on the PC

I do love the Vita, don’t get me wrong. It’s got some superb exclusives like the Vanillaware and Disgaea Games, and I know that we all love Persona 4 Golden. What physicals I do have I’m more than happy to keep, but I’m struggling to decide if I should keep investing in digital games for the console.

You've probably heard many people tell you it would eventually happen back in December 2017 and to reduce expose to crypto [(including me)](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7l7k9i/daily_general_discussion_december_21_2017/drl2esi/), but when you're hyped up on 20% gains every week its hard to be cautious or engage in defensive measures. To many the last quarter of 2017 and into early 2018 was like a beach party with coke and Victoria Secret models. Who wants to listen to someone tell you about how you're gonna crash hard with a headache the next morning?

With this latest crash, Bitcoin's price is back to roughly mid October 2017, which is roughly when the mainstream mania started. Many on this sub entered after October 2017 and hence are now left holding heavy bags. Many are down 80% or even 90%.  Here is the current losses from ATH for the top cryptos:

Asset | Loss from ATH
-- | --
BTC | -77%
XRP | - 88%
ETH | -90%
BCH | -95%
XLM | -79%
EOS | -83%
LTC | -91%
ADA | -96%
XMR | -85%
TRN | -96%

**Who do we blame?**
--------------------------------------------------

At a time like this its easy to get angry, to look at someone to blame. Whether Roger Ver and the hash wars, whether BAAKT delay, whether whales or SEC or institutions, everyone has their favorite boogeyman. No one thing is the reason why the market is down 80%. 

The reality is that Bitcoin (and all other crypto by extension) was ovevalued even by grossly overoptimistic measures. Its not BAKKT or the whales trying to get your coins for cheap. The same people who were buying at near peak bubble thinking they were getting into the chance of a lifetime are prone to look for someone to blame for their losses, when it was actually their fault for buying near the end of a mania. 

Nobody wants to admit that it was their own greed, lack of research and irrational behavior that lead to the gross overvaluation of all cryptocurrency.

**Is it over yet?**
--------------------------------------------------

The $6K consolidation was likely a result of the market coiling tighter and tighter around the mining breakeven point for some of the smaller miners. The big firms in China are profitable mining below 6K, but many smaller ones in the US and Europe aren't. You can actually [see the total hash rate going down](https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rate). Once it broke it was a big fall straight down. 

Bitcoin is mined at 12.5 BTC. per block at 10 minute blocks, which comes out to around 1800 BTC every day. This 1800 BTC has to be absorbed by every day, which means the following at different price levels:

Price Level | Daily net buying needed to absorb mined coins
---|---
6000 | $10.8 million/day
4500 | $8.1 million/day
3000 | $5.4 million/day

At the current price, at least theoretically $8.4 million in demand is needed to cover the mining output. Of course the miners don't immediately dump it all, but it shows why miners have an incentive to keep the price high and try to incite FOMO with a BGD. 

I can also see that after this latest drop, the ""buy the dip"" sentiment had substantially gone down, at least compared to the other fast drops in price. This is especially discouraging those who were waiting for the ""November bull run"", which never came. Its clear to more people now that this probably isn't just downward correction that will reverse, but a multiyear bear market. This is why the bounce has been so weak compared to earlier in the year. Compare that to the last two big 2 day drops:

* March 29 - April 1st (drop from 8K to 6K): Within 2 days it bounced back up to 7.5K

* June 22-24 (drop from 6.8K to 5.8K): Within 2 days it bounced back to 6.3K

The weakness of this current bounce says it all, people are no longer optimistic that BAKKT or ETF or any other catalyst will lead to a bull run that they can cash out quick. It may be a period of stagnation followed by further drops as big holders take profits.

I also think that the FED tightening with rate hikes is leading to a lot more volatility not only in stocks, but crypto as well. Right now asset deflation seems to be a global macro risk as cheap credit dries up, and Bitcoin surely isn't immune from this.

My personal view is that at this point we may see further declines, but calling what's going to happen next is always dangerous. A whale (especially a big mining operation) with a series of large orders to clear out the order book on Bitfinex could give us a BGD out of nowhere at any time and take us back to 6K, it would be interesting to see how the market reacts to something like that. But I'm not betting on it leading to any sustained rally past 10K. Quite the opposite.

---------------------------------------------------

So what's a crypto shrimp to do? I'll split my thoughts into two, for those who are still in the green and those in the loss.

**If you're still in the green**
--------------------------------------------------


If you're still in profit, this is a great time to consider how much more downward selling you can take and also how you can hedge downward risk.

If you're someone who purchased when Bitcoin was below $1000, you should [calculate your compounded annual ROI](https://financial-calculators.com/roi-calculator) and decide if that return is good enough for you. For equities, the long term average is about 10% per year, 20-30% in a good bull market. 

Its your decision, but taking out profits that exceed principal and reinvesting the principal is not at all a bad idea. For those who invested before Bitcoin reached $1K (April 2017) the current price is still an insane return that no other asset class can match.

Another important thing is to think about how you can hedge the risk of downward movement. This is where derivative exchanges are very useful, although you do need to do some research on how derivatives work and how to not get liquidated. If you have substantial holdings, the effort to learn this is worth it. 

The basic idea is that you can buy short contracts that increase in value as Bitcoin goes down, proportional to the amount of leverage you put to finance the contract. If managed correctly, you can protect your entire stack with a portion as leverage. Its something commonly done by miners, who short Bitcoin with derivatives to hedge their holdings.

**If you're in the loss**
--------------------------------------------------


The untold reality is that HODL is a meme told to newbies to prevent panic selling during a downturn while the smart money cashes out in a more orderly fashion. But does that mean you shouldn't hold if you're already down massively? 

Well that depends on your own life situation, how much you've invested, and if you don't need the money for the next few years.

Mathematically, whether it drops to 4.5K or 3K from the reference of 6K is highly meaningful, its a drop of 25% or 50%. But if your reference starting point is much higher, then it really doesn't matter all that much. A drop from 17K to 4.5K is a 74% loss while down to 3K it would be 82%, massive losses either way. In that sense if this is money you don't need, it makes sense to simply have it stored in a wallet and forget about it for a few years. Who cares if it drops further after a certain point if you don't plan to take it out for a while? Its like in equities markets where people with massive losses don't sell, but instead move the loss position into their retirement fund where they don't plan to take it out for a long time and thus are giving it time to rebound back.

But what if its money you need? What if like many out there you took out loans hoping to catch a run to 50K? If you have high interest debt (credit cards...etc), focus on paying that down first. Credit cards generally have high interest and many compound daily, so pay down the debt first rather than trying to pay your debts off with a crypto bull run that may take years to materialize.

This is also a good learning opportunity. It is worrying how few people who hold crypto have a clue what any of this even is or how it works. [I've always recommended this video to explain how Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) actually work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4).

A good thing to do during catastrophic losses is to honestly access why you got suckered into buying high in the first place. Most people here are young, and this is a valuable lesson in why you shouldn't follow the herd.  Everyone is a genius in a bull market, everyone is chasing the next hype. Crypto tends to attract people looking for a get-rich-quick-without-effort crowd, but it takes some mental effort to understand this beyond the buzzwords. Take the time to understand the fundamental reasons why an asset has value and what factors would drive its rise once the hype dies down. What makes Bitcoin valuable, what makes some of the other cryptoassets valuable? If those fundamentals in some way changes, so should your opinion. 

Its also a great opportunity to help in its adoption by using it. The irony of it all is that people demand that they get rich because of the hard work of buying a bunch of crypto in an exchange and transferring it to their wallet, without any understanding what they're buying into. 

Also don't be angry. Don't look to blame. Look to learn and improve next time you invest.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I Received an Enormous Amount of Money Recently and I Have No Idea What to Do,"Financially, I've never made anything higher than a $30k salary. There were times when I've been super broke, and my parents aren't rich, so I'm definitely acquainted with a super frugal and money conscious way of life. Which is why some changes of late have really been messing me up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Without going in to very complicated detail, I made almost $1m this year. It came fast, and sort of out of the blue, and although it's a life-changing event, it's propelled me to a very paranoid and anxious state in which I fear that I will squander it away without doing anything smart or responsible with it. My situation is different from some other posts on here, in which someone inherits or comes across a lump sum of money only one time. There is a large possibility that I will continue to make the same if not more in the coming year. However, there is also a chance I will make significantly less due to the nature of my profession. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been warned by an accountant and pretty much everyone I have asked about this matter that in that tax bracket, I could owe the IRS 50%. So then, I'm told, the smartest thing I can do is shelter as much money as possible. But the ideas I've been getting are so random and questionable, I really don't know what is right. So far, I've been told to:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Put the money away in an index fund
2. Put the money away in an IRA, but certain kinds will not allow me to open one because I made more than the limit. Also, I heard that you can only put in $5000 a year. 
3. Buy a ton of real estate, rent some, and claim others as a loss. (although I do not see myself maintaining renting and committing to this kind of investment that only pays off 10-15 years down the line)
4. Buy art 
5. Gpvernment Bonds
6. Play the market (i have no idea how to do this, and I don't want to be Madoff'ed)
7. Buy a sham house in Florida or Texas where there are no state taxes. 

My plan is to put away 3 years of living costs (rent, utilities, car) away in a stagnant savings account. With the remaining, I couldn't just put away $800k into an index fund because I'll have to give most of it to the IRS. How much money should I to pay taxes? How much of the remainder should I invest, and if I happen to need to take that money of the index fund, could I do so with as much ease as my savings account? 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do with this money. I don't want to waste it on jet skis, but i also don't want to lose by shady investing. I just want to know what is right and responsible. Desperate for help.

economy,Euro and pound are ready for growth,"**Euro and Pound** had risen after the draft declaration between the UK and the European Commission. Market reaction seems very moderate, as it is not the end of the negotiations on Brexit. However, there is a good chance for the currencies to turn towards growth in the long run.

The outgoing year can be called “a year of trade conflicts” that have eroded the demand for risky assets and, what is more important, noticeably cooled down the global growth rate. Europe is affected by too many of them: trade disputes with Britain, the decline in demand from China due to trade wars with the United State and direct US tariffs on European products. All these factors are hindering the economic growth and make pressure on the common currency and the British pound.

&amp;#x200B;

Market participants are mostly skeptical about further negotiations. Change of the investors’ attitude would become a driver for Sterling. British currency had received such support several times on dips to the 1.2700 region since August – and now there is a similar case. Previously **GBPUSD** had been managed to grow into the 1.31-1.32 area. Now investors are waiting the voting in British Parliament, which will take place the second week of December.

The single currency has bounced from the 17-month lows in recent weeks but now is developing the downward trend by the **EURUSD.** Sustainable braking above 1.14 can be a signal of players’ confidence in future prospects. In addition, there are several fundamental factors on the euro side: winding down ECB’s QE by the end of the year and move to the next stage in the form of rate hikes. The Fed takes a more cautious stance, which undermines the dollar's position.

&amp;#x200B;

Technical picture attracts attention too. The impulses of the euro weakening since May had sent quotes to the new local lows. However, the RSI is displaying powerful impulse to decrease. Such divergence may be the pivot point for rolling back into 1.17 area and may lay ground for a more substantial rally in the 1.23 area next year.

personalfinance,Prioritize paying off low interest loan or saving?,"Please note that I don't live/didn't study in the US, I'm just asking for general advice for my situation.

I have roughly $25000 in student loan debts. In my country the interest rate for student loans are extremely low (think 0.01%-0.3% max) and as far as I know won't be increased a lot over the next couple of years. I have to start paying back these loans after next summer.

Luckily, there are plenty of ways to delay repayment and I can pretty much determine myself how much I'm going to pay back. Question is, though, should I prioritize paying back these low interest loans over saving?

Right now I save approximately 20% of my net income (half of which goes to my buffer/long term savings account and half goes to my short term savings account). I live relatively frugal but I like to travel and did so quite a lot in the past year. As I haven't been able to save too much in the past years due to some streaks of bad luck, I'm planning to travel a little less in the coming year to build up my buffer and save for some stuff I wanted to have for a long time.",finance

personalfinance,Car Affordability vs Government Subsidy,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been subbed here for awhile and have enjoyed reading the great responses here. It would be great if I could get some of that same advice. My question is on  cars and budgeting. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have been looking at the new Kona Electric, and the government is offering fairly large subsidies. Gas is around $5.50 to $6 a gallon here ($1.50 a liter). Between ""federal"" / ""state"" subsidies, up to 12k and 5k this year for a combined 17k. Next year is drops to 9k and probably 3-4k, for a total of 12-13k. The car itself is around 54k with the options and stuff we are looking at. We could theoretically put down as much as 15k as a down payment, though I would rather not. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've read the 20 / 4 / 10 rule. That gets us a lot less car. How much would a financial adviser be okay with bending this rule to take advantage of government subsidies, in a country with expensive gas?  To top it off, the government gives around $1500 to install a charging station too, if my information is right. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live abroad, in South Korea, but I will put my totals in dollar amounts. I've bullet pointed my financial situation with a bit of explanation below the car question, I'll try to error on the side of a bit too much info.

&amp;#x200B;

\-- I'm 38, recently married. I gross around $4500 a month minimum, sometimes a bit more. My wife takes home around $2400, but has some automatic deductions for investments for the next 5 years, so it ends up being $1600. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-- We just bought a house, payments are around $1300 a month, principle interest insurance etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-- My wife is starting grad school  next Fall, and her take home salary will drop to around $1,000 a month after her deductions.  Grad school here is about $5,000 a semester, for everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-- We are likely going to have kid(s) after she finishes grad school.

&amp;#x200B;

A new car would be nice for where we are moving to, but not absolutely necessary. It would allow me to work and earn a bit more money as well (I have multiple jobs teaching uni classes).  We would definitely need one if / when kids happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

btc,Education is a system of imposed ignorance,"Hello BCHes,

Please read. I come in peace.
I have a few suggestions for this sub.

Either we want to acknowledge or not, Bitcoin is not that big. We are still in its infancy. Yeah, there are a lot of people out there that have heard about ""Bitcoin"", but most of them don't understand the technology behind and don't understand what it will do for planet Earth.

Now, I have been in Bitcoin since 2011. I don't care if you believe me or not, but I want you to understand that I've been with most of you thru all of this. What I want to talk about is we are now ongoing into a full on War on Perception. There is too much information out there and all these newbz don't even know where to start. That’s why they will get sidetracked with all kind of misinformation. 

The other sides (***cough*** you know of whom I speak) understand this and that's why they are ramping up the brainwashing with ""official news"", 1984 double-speak, creating a walled garden and banning the ""non-believers"".

I got the inspiration for this thread from my discussion with newbs on Twitter and this newb here on reddit just a couple of days ago ( please check the link to understand what the rest of this thread is about):

https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9z56go/bch_has_already_won_the_bsv_camp_just_havent/ea6w1ri/

See how grateful this newb was that somebody took the time to put all the information into perspective and created a timeline for him to follow???

I see a lot of newbz that have absolutely no idea what the F they are talking about, but they read some shit news(CG) about this technology and now they know everything... They don't even know 1% of the history, or technology for that matter, and I think it's time we get dropped some MF knowledge.

I have visited all the links on r/btc front page and most of them lead to good websites that do indeed have a lot of information. What we are missing is a TL;DR version that should be Stickied on the front page, first link so that everybody new that comes here can have a good read. If we provide that I think we can get rid of a lot of trolls and get rid of a lot of misinformation.

For the last week, I've been battling this misinformation, but I can't stay and do this all day: ""I got shit to do man!"". If you look at my posting history you'll see that the last time I was this active was last year after the fork happened. I see now the same things I saw then, a lot of misinformed sheep that are blindly following the trolls.

HOW do we fix this?

We stick an ELI5 as the first link on this sub. Even if we have some information on the right side, most of them won;t go there. Why? Because people are lazy/dumb/uninformed ( sorry if this breaks any rules, but it;s the MF truth) and don't like to do their own research. 

So we will provide this for them in an orderly and easy to read manner. That way all noobs will go to the first link and we will provide the history in an easy to read ELI5.

We need something that is ELI5 so that everybody understand what the F is going on.

The reason this:

and this:

and this:

https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43

got so many views and started so many discussions is because they are written in an easy to read and understand ELI5 language. 
I know most of us ( at least the OGs ) are technical and can understand the nuances of what Bitcoin is, does and where it’s going, but the rest of the world isn’t. It’s our job to make them understand what Bitcoin is. If we let them astray, they will get brainwashed by Alts and CSW ( as we have seen, in the last year, he has gathered a lot of  NON-Technical followers because sheep just follow )


OK MF you got my attention!!!!

How does your dumb bottocks propose we do this?

Well funny you should ask. I got just the dumb plan on how to do this:
We write an ELI5 to Bitcoin that is funny and interactive!!! Something that will keep them engaged while also dropping some MF knowledge.
That MF easy.

We need a good introduction. Smth like this: “In the begging we had the FED, fractional reserve banking and FIAT currencies. Satoshi group unilaterally agreed this was a bad idea and decided there was a need to change the way this works. We need to create a system that provides financial sovereignty to the people of Earth. Just like we had to separate Church and State, we need to separate Money and State in order for our civilization to thrive and reach the stars ( make it Sci-Fi. People love that shit) So the Satoshi group came up with this technology that solves an old ""Byzantine generals"" problem ( we link some wikipedia stuff ) and they called it simply Bitcoin.”


We then do a quick recap of the early attempts of creating crypto-currencies and why they failed. We don’t need a lot of text here because it doesn’t matter for them. Just something to make them understand that there have been people working on this for a long time.

Then we start dropping the knowledge from Singularity;s, John Block and etc… to make them understand how Blockstream tried to take over BTC by adding SegWit. Then we just add more information until we get the how nChain tried to take over BCH and how they got their asses handed to them. We can add videos ( like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By0w43NQdiY ), external links and all that jazz to make them understand what the F actually happened from 2009 until present day. Of course we can keep adding information and videos, but we should start with the bare minimum for all newbz to understand.

Hope you get the gist of what I’m trying to accomplish. Mods I’ll need a lot of help from you because I’m sure you have more knowledge than me.
I have a lot of links and other things I can post, but I tried to make this as short as I could.

If people are into this, I can dedicate as much time as I have to this.
Because I MF love BCH. I love this community and nobody will take the dream of P2P Electronic Cash from me.

Please respond with your thoughts on this, I will need a lot of input from the community about how they want to go with this.

All the best,

personalfinance,preventing homelessness + continuing studies w/o worry. any advice welcome.,"Hello personalfinance, thanks and sorry in advance for any help and negative feelings from this post and the wall of text. I'll admit my problem is quite severe. I'd really love some expert advice but anything is welcome.

**Brief intro:** I am a 22 year old male in SA, Australia and I have just finished my first year of university (towards 4 year bachelor). By the looks of income vs spending, I’m not going to finish my degree before Westpac (lender) takes the home since it’s mortgaged. I don’t know what I want out of my life except maybe to finish university and be an engineer. I don’t want to be homeless if I can help it. I don’t know what I want to study in my life but I don’t know if I have time nor money to try different things. 

**Difficulty:** I’m afraid of being too old if/when I finish my degree and thus be too uncreative of a thinker which is what an ideal engineer would be especially nowadays. I’m also afraid life might not be worth fighting for if I end up with a career that is too stressful (like tradesman) which is why I'm trying to avoid it. I am currently living with my parents for free but occasionally help with finances and bankruptcy is imminent (a guess using salary data below). 

Also, morality related questions are not something I would bring up here but since they will change where I should invest my money and everyone here really wants to help then I will ask… I don’t want to move out because I feel ashamed about leaving my parents to their own devices. They don’t know how to navigate the community’s systems due to their lack of English-speaking skills and so they don’t understand how to find financial support. Additionally, I feel a part of the reason of why they are bankrupt since they paid for my living. So naturally I think it’s moral to stay and help. However, my father’s a tobacco and alcohol addict and my mother is abusive. I don’t want to enable my father’s drug addiction nor do I want to live with my mother. The drugs cost approximately 400 pmonth but increases with income however its decreased a bit due to him saving money fearing homelessness. It’s hard to persuade him to smoke and drink less and permanently since he loves it so much and behaviour change is very hard.

**My question:** How can I achieve financial independence and stability and get to finish study before my thinking ability reduces from it’s peak if I can all while staying within moral boundaries?



Spending and income: 
House mortgage = $1,442/pmonth (interest only) but will increase to ~$2,200/pmonth (principal +interest) assuming current interest rate, starting 7th January 2021.

Utilities: water= $270/quarter, electricity = $260/quarter, gas = $280/quarter, council = $240~/quarter.

Father’s salary = $15/hour. Hours per week vary from 0 to 40 and $500 per/fn from welfare

Mother’s salary = $15/hour. Same as father. And $514 per/fn from welfare

Sister = $289 perfn but doesn’t want to contribute and is unemployed (studying to be a nurse)

Me = same as sister and unemployed (studying to be engineer but probably tradesman at this rate)
My welfare payment can increase to 550 perfn if I move out.

**Edit:** Thanks for the advice, everyone. A lot of people are telling me to move out and while that does seem like a good idea, I can't help but think that this would mean I have to drop studies to work full-time and pay off some slightly exy rent forever. I'm concerned about working some dead-end trade that ends with a 50 year old, embittered me. 

**Follow up question:** If I want to get out of this with an engineering degree then does that mean I have to work full-time + study? Does anyone know if this is possible/feasible and does anyone have experience with this routine that they think I should know about?",finance

I need to buy a laptop soon that will likely cost between $1100 and $1300.

Would it be advisable to apply for a new credit card and fully pay off my current one so that I can get a better interest rate and use the new credit card to gain rewards on a major laptop purchase?

personalfinance,It's a myth that a raise can cost you money in US Federal Income Taxes,"I've heard stories about people who got a raise only to find out that they were bringing home less money because of ""taxes"" on the additional income, and I've always been suspicious. It just didn't sound right. So I've done calculations to satisfy myself that, in fact, it can't happen as regards US federal income tax.

My calculations and conclusions do not take any of the following into account:

* state and local taxes
* payroll taxes of other kinds
* changes in other payroll deductions
* company policies

I suppose one could lose income on a raise if some tax took a single percentage of all income, with the percentage set in income brackets; then if the raise put one over a threshold to a higher rate, the tax could increase such that the new total tax would be higher than the difference between the old salary and the new one. It would likely involve a small raise, the crossing of a threshold, and a big percentage increase due to crossing the threshold. But US Federal Taxes don't work like that.

Marginal tax rate system

The US Federal Income tax is a marginal one; I will explain that in a short way here, There are other explanations that are more extensive and possibly better elsewhere.

The government sets 'tax brackets', the ones I have for the last tax year (2017) are:

		 Income
            from      to   tax
             0 -   9500   10%
        9500 -  38750  12%
      38750 -  82500  22%
    157500 - 200000  24%
    200000 - 500000  32%
    500000 -              37%

The ""marginal"" part means we pay 10% of our income up to $9500; for income between 9500 and 38750 we pay 12%, and so forth.

So for an (adjusted) income of $50k, raw tax liability would be

    $  950	(10% of the first 9500)
    $ 3510  (12% of the 29250 between 9500 and 38750)
    $ 2700  (22% of the 11250 between 38750 and 50000)
    ------
    $ 7160  total
		
So this is an effective tax rate of 7160/50000 = 14%.
		
So if someone gets a raise to, say, $55,000, they will get $5,000 per year additional income and pay 22% ($1100) on that additional $5,000. Since the tax burden on the existing income does not change, and one always pays (far) less than 100% of the additional money, it is not possible to lose overall income due to Federal Income Tax on the raise.

I'm also not talking about withholding amounts, which are only vaguely related to the amount of tax that you will pay. I don't know what calculations are made to determine withholding, it might be interesting to see the effect a raise could have on those.

I read a post fairly recently that said a person's employer stated that giving them a raise would cost them money. I would be interested in the details of any cases where this is true, but I'm convinced it cannot be from Federal Taxes.

Do people know of other kinds of deductions or payments that can cause one to lose income because of a raise?",finance

personalfinance,"Since June 30th, 2018, FedLoan has been wrongfully reporting IBRs with PFH as having capitalized interest (although they should not) to credit monitoring companies. Here is how I got them to stop for mine...","I found out that although borrowers with IBRs and partial financial hardship are not to have capitalized interest at least for the term of the repayment plan, FedLoan was reporting their balance to credit monitoring companies as though they did have capitalized interest. According to the people I talked to at FedLoan, this was a directive by the Dept. of Education. I don't know if that's true or not, though I wouldn't put it past them with DeVos there... Anyway, I made quite a few calls and emails over the next few days, sending a few clear cease and desist messages and letting them know I would be taking legal action if they did not correctly report my balance as per my repayment agreement, and that it would go very poorly for them. I sent it through their email system (which is annoying b/c you can only do 2000 characters and basically no punctuation except periods and commas) and uploaded it under ""other"" to my documents on my account. Today they did remove the capitalized interest from my credit reports! 


Here is the last message I sent them, which I think was the most helpful for my case, and also explains exactly why what they're doing to IBR borrowers with PFH is wrong. I also sent similar messages explaining this to the credit monitoring sites. I hope this can help you all in similar situations!




...All of this is based on information directly on your website, which I have made screen captures and archives of and which you would also be compelled to disclose in a lawsuit. Keep in mind I have an IBR with PFH. 


You say “*Capitalization is the addition of unpaid accrued interest to the principal balance of your loans. This means that your principal balance increases, so you will pay more in interest over the life of the loans.*” Then you say “As of June 30, 2018, FedLoan Servicing changed how we report your account's Current Balance to consumer reporting agencies. Previously, we reported your Current Balance as your principal balance only; *presently, we are reporting your account's Current Balance as your 
•	Principal balance,
•	Unpaid accrued interest* and
•	Late fees, if applicable.” 

And “Previously, we reported your Current Balance as your principal balance. However, as of June 30, 2018, *FedLoan Servicing updated the way we report your Current Balance to consumer reporting agencies to reflect your account's principal balance, unpaid accrued interest*, and late fees (if applicable).” 

So based on your own definition of what capitalized interest is, you are now (falsely) reporting my current balance as having capitalized interest. This is a false report because, again, as your own website states, “*IBR: Interest will not be capitalized while you have a Partial Financial Hardship (PFH).*” 

Yet, as you admit above, you are reporting my current balance as capitalized interest, because “*Capitalization is the addition of unpaid accrued interest to the principal balance of your loans,*” and you are reporting my “*Current Balance to consumer reporting agencies to reflect your account's principal balance [with the addition of] unpaid accrued interest*” as one figure. 

You say yourself that “Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), *we are required to report complete and accurate information*,” which you are directly violating by reporting capitalization when there is, and should not be, any capitalization (*“principal balance [with the addition of] unpaid accrued interest”*) on my IBR with PFH. Doing so is reporting incomplete and inaccurate information.

I’d also like to note that even if there was to be legitimate capitalization (which in this case there is not), you would still have to provide *30 days’ notice.* However, you admit on your own site that you did not provide any notice: 

“*Why wasn't I notified about the change in how you reported my Current Balance?* We apologize if this change caused you any inconvenience as that was not our intention. We are required to notify the consumer reporting agencies of your Current Balance on a monthly basis.”

So again, this is illegitimate capitalization. 

So again, I’m letting you know that you have 9 days to provide ACTUAL accurate information to credit monitoring companies, as you’re required to “under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.” If you have not provided them with my accurate current balance, which is $X, since I have not legitimately accrued any capitalized interest, within 9 days, I will take legal action. And given the above information, I am very confident that neither a class action nor a lawsuit from CA’s Attorney General will go well for you at all.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

However, now that I'm on a different shift, it's going to be a bit less than I was getting previously and I don't see a promotion coming until spring time.  Also, because I know that paying down debt is typically more money-efficient than saving... I've not been putting anything in savings.  And what I did have in savings I used to get out of the house when me fiancée and I split.

&amp;#x200B;

\- My Ex's car is actually in both of our names and I don't have need for two cars. I really don't want the loan either, but after looking at loan options to pay off the difference, it's the same (or worse) interest rate with a higher monthly payment than I'm paying on her car now.

\- I'd like to get a different car and trade in both vehicles and carry over any debt, but when I look at the online calculators, they estimate that I can only afford a $19,000 loan. (I estimated a 12% APR due to my lower credit score)

personalfinance,Always read the fine print. Storytime!,"Background:  
When I got my new job, I was fresh out of collage, bad credit, etc and I needed a loan (parents &amp; friends were to broke to help me)  


Anyways, I managed to get a terrible loan with an abysmal interest rate.  


Fast forward 1/2 a year, my credit score went from terrible to 'good' and was managing to put \~$50-100 aside every month (which was good, because I ended up needing new tires for my car). lo and behold I get an Email from the company I have the loan from ""You qualify for a bigger loan!"" (a fair bit bigger too) so I replied saying ""instead of increasing my loan size, can I get a better interest rate?""  


and they said yes, %10 less interest, my monthly payments would go down from \~330 to \~300, but with the caveat that I did have to get a loan increase.

nice thing is, they allow lump sum payments without any penalty.  


so, I said sure, after some double checking, they called me in to do some final signing.  
everyone was really cheerful, there was some warm friendly chat, everything was ok.  


they had a list something like this:  


\-You get 1500 to your account.  
\-3000 goes to paying off the last loan (that this replaces)

\-80 for security fee.

&amp;#x200B;

that's all fine, next page:

basically described the monthly payment: 220(payment) + 80(security) = 300 per month.  


now, please note, last time doe to me just starting my job + bad credit, the security fee was mandatory, but I saw a key word this time ""optional""  


I pointed this out to the person helping me, and asked to remove it,   
and boy, the whole atmosphere changed.  
""but what if your injured?"" - my job pays me more then the amount of my loan (by a long shot) if Im injured that badly.  
""what if you're fired"" a: they just promoted me, b: I'm in reasonably high demand, and can get another job quite quickly.  
""it wont actually save you on your monthly payments since we adjust how long it takes to pay off the loan to keep that rate"" a: that'll make me be finished paying off the loan faster (great!) and b: they didn't.   


They didn't even have a proper form for me to sign to remove it (they had a little picture of how terrible life would be if I lost my job) that they asked me to sign under.  


so, now I:  
get more deposited to my account. (which will be going straight back to them)

save almost a 3rd off my monthly payment.

and with the lower interest I owe them less overall after all my payments are done.  


so yeah, I'm happy =D  


  
p.s: loan default insurance is not necessarily a bad thing, but when the insurance payments are 1/3 of your regular payments, the negatives outweigh the benefits)

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a long time lurker here and I've always appreciated the advice I've seen so this was the first place I thought of coming when I heard the good news. Like the title says, my boss told me on Wednesday that I would be receiving a (significant) pay raise and additional equity in the company ($32,000).  I've been running numbers in my head ever since and I need some advice on what to do with the extra income. I'm by no means a finance or investing expert so I could use all the advice I can get.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the details I think you'll need but I can add more if anyone has questions. My monthly take home pay is now $4,400 and my monthly expenses are $2,000. My only debt right now is my student loans and my mortgage which I split with my husband (total payment is $1,200/month). 

&amp;#x200B;

My current student loan balance is $24,000 which is a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized loans with an average interest rate of 5.6%.  My current monthly payment is $410. 

&amp;#x200B;

My company also awarded me an additional $32,000 in equity (restricted stock) which vests in equal quarterly payments over the next 4 years. I have the option to receive $12,000 in cash instead of equity but I would receive it under the same schedule as the equity award.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

1. Should I put all or a portion of my extra income ($2,400) towards paying of off my student loans? I really love the idea of paying them off within the next year because my husband and I are planning on having kids and we both agree I will be a stay-at-home mom. My husband said he doesn't mind but I would feel immensely guilty if he had to pick up my student loan payments.
2. Should I choose to take the $12,000 in cash instead of equity?
3. How would you use this extra income? Invest it? Save it? 

Also, I have absolutely 0 investing experience.  I have stock in the company I work for but I just hold onto it as it vests, I figure it will be our kids college fund some day.

CryptoCurrency,True HODLERS should ignore the price movement.,"Well, it is impossible to ignore the price movement, BUT it is entirely possible not to freak out about it.

There is one major reason to relax: our current governmental, financial and monetary systems will be put to test when the sovereign debt crisis hits the fan. Guys, in terms of total global debt we are past what we were in 2007... except this time the debt is coming mainly from the government. In the past the government rescued the economy from major financial meltdowns.  Each one was characterized by excessive amounts of debt, just like today. There is no one ""out there"" to save the government. What happens when a government is at risk of defaulting? Well... shit hits the fan in a major way.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, the US is well on its way to be put in a situation where the leadership will have to decide between major/hyper inflation, massive cuts of benefits, massive tax hikes for the rich/corporations, a combination of these OR default. The severity of those changes will inevitably cause a major economic slowdown, that could very well lead us into a self-destructing death spiral. This is not a conspiracy theory, the numbers are out there, same as they were in 2007.

&amp;#x200B;

There will be an urgent need to redefine our concept of money in order to provide a new stable economic atmosphere. The big question is, why would anyone that has had to endure hyper inflation ever want adopt a newly created promissory bill from the same guys that just f-ed it up? Pun intended. The adoption rate for people under 30 should be tremendous. That would mean that in another 10 years, the adoption under 40 should be even higher. In that way, with time, one system substitutes another... It is similar to the way electronic FIAT transactions has substituted cash (for most part). FIAT and banks will continue to exist, but without a doubt one day they will become ""money from the old world"". In 10-20 years the digital economy will be much bigger than the one we have today. Think about the insane exponential growth within tech stocks... the new giants of tomorrow will most likely go public using blockchain technology. The future economy will be largely based on tokenized securities and digital assets. It would be very hard to stay cool without sharing this vision of the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Crypto has already proven that it is a MUCH more powerful platform for startups seeking to raise funds. This crash is actually in part of how effective a certain crypto worked as a financial platform... billions of dollars raised by so many crappy projects and teams.  Think about this for a minute... the Crypto system is a global stock and forex exchange that is open 24/7 and happens to be available to anyone in the world via the internet. That is combined with having excellent properties as a store of value and medium of exchange.

So, **instead of** **$7k/year** on housing it will **jump up to $42k-$54k/y ($3,500 - $4,500 /m principal, interest, property taxes, insurance, utilities, etc ).** This is assuming we get a reasonably priced home given the 4.5-5% interest rates and with no HOA. Los Angeles has high housing costs so a basic home can be **600k** but the move-in ready homes are closer to **800k**. So, we are assuming a house cost between those price ranges.

&amp;#x200B;

So, based on this increase of housing costs our Annual Expenses would then become $87k - $99k per year. If we are both working at $260k / year this seems ok and we'd still be saving between $68k-80k per year. However, if we have a kid and say we go **single income** (for her to raise the kid) then we would be saving only $1k-13k per year.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this, I have a few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Since we have a solid amount of liquid cash ($600k) how should we allocate it right now to help us plan for retirement?** 

For example, we can put a large payment down so that we have a small monthly payment, continue to cashflow, and continue to save cash to invest elsewhere (retirement, real estate, stocks, et.). However, this means we are not leveraging our money. The other thought is we put down only 20% meaning we have a larger payment to pay every month, save A LOT less cash, but will be able to put more of our current cash into investments right now. If the latter is the case, then how would we allocate the remainder of the $600k after the downpayment?

&amp;#x200B;

**2. How can I find out the minimum amount we need to save each year to hit retirement between 45-55?**

 Saving $13k per year on a single income doesn't seem like it would help us get to retirement until like 65+. I plan pretty conservatively so I'm trying to figure out, if we bought a house based on a single income how much would we need to save each year to hit an earlier retirement between ages 45-55.

&gt; Subramanian (equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch) says investors can now turn somewhere they have not been able to for a long time as stocks stall out: cash. ""There is now an alternative for stocks,"" Subramanian said, noting yields for cash are higher today than for 60 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies. ""Cash is now competitive and will likely grow more so … our Fed call puts short rates close to 3.5% by the end of 2019, well above the S&amp;P 500's 1.9% dividend yield.""",finance

# **Trump's trade talks with China could snap markets out of their funk  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/23/trumps-trade-talks-with-china-could-snap-markets-out-of-their-funk.html)**
*****
&gt; As stocks enter the short Thanksgiving holiday week, investors looking for any signs of a market comeback are paying close attention to trade developments with China.
*****
The coming week could be an important turning point for two big fear factors for markets — trade wars and rising interest rates.
*****
&gt; The big event of the week, and one that could impact markets and the economy for months to come, is the meeting between President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G-20 in Buenos Aires, which starts Friday. There is hope that both sides will show a willingness to negotiate and hold off on a further escalation of tariffs.
*****
&gt; There is also an appearance by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday, and traders are hoping he will calm some of the market angst about rising interest rates. Fed officials recently have sounded slightly more dovish, and the market has begun pricing out multiple rate hikes for next year, though a rate hike is expected when the Fed meets Dec. 18 and 19.
*****
&gt; Stocks sold off in the worst Thanksgiving holiday week for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 since 2011. The Dow was down 4.4 percent for the week, to 24,286, while the S&amp;P 500 was off 3.8 percent, to 2,632. Nasdaq was down 4.3 percent, at 6,938.
*****
&gt; Stakes are high for the talks between Trump and Xi, and traders have been awaiting that meeting as a potential catalyst that could shake the market out of its current slump. The S&amp;P 500 has lost 9.7 percent since the beginning of the quarter and is now down 1.5 percent for the year so far. It is also more than 10 percent off its high, entering correction territory.
*****
&gt; ""It won't be a viable move unless there is reason to think this is more than just a feel-good announcement from the White House. It could be very important for markets,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. If the talks show no signs of progress, strategists said it could be a major negative for stocks.
*****
&gt; Many economists have factored a trade war into their forecasts for 2019 and expect the tariffs to have some impact on the economy, especially if they are increased, as threatened by Trump. Tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent in January, and Trump has said he may ultimately tax all Chinese imports.
*****
&gt; ""The greatest boost Trump could provide to the economy would be to lift the tariffs on China to get a better deal with China on trade. Our sense is a deal is not priced into financial markets, as skepticism remains that either side can reach an agreement politically,"" notes Strategas Research's Dan Clifton, head of policy research.
*****
&gt; ""We try to not sugarcoat that reaching an agreement between China and the U.S. will be easy ... we believe the U.S. and China both have an incentive to do a deal now. We do not expect a formal agreement but a framework that guides the path forward for a future deal,"" he added.
*****
&gt; U.S. officials have been hopeful for progress, including Trump, who said that China wants to make a deal, but there were tensions between Xi and Vice President Mike Pence at the recent Apec summit. On Friday, Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen was quoted as saying China hopes to meet the U.S. halfway on trade issues.
*****
&gt; But it's unclear whether the meeting will result in much progress. Analysts see it as a positive that White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, a strident critic of China, will not be at the meeting.

# A Historically Bad Q4 So Far

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 falling 9.08% QTD, it has been the sixth-worst start to the fourth quarter in the history of the S&amp;P 500. The only worse Q4s (through 37 trading days) came during some of the worst years for the stock market (1929, the 1930s, 1973, 1987, and 2008).

&gt; Below is a table showing the worst starts to Q4 for the S&amp;P 500 through 37 trading days. Any drop of more than 2% at this point in the quarter made the list. As shown in the table, the average change for the S&amp;P for the remainder of these years has been a gain of 2.77% with positive returns 78.26% of the time. For all other Q4s in the S&amp;P’s history, the average change for the remainder of the year has been +1.61%.

&gt; Of course, it’s not all good news. If you look at the window of Q4s that were down between 8% and 12% like we are this year, the S&amp;P actually declined for the remainder of those four years.

&gt; And in case you don’t remember, at this point in Q4 2008, the S&amp;P was down 35.5%! In that year, the S&amp;P ended up rallying 20% for the remainder of the year before plummeting to new lows again in the first quarter of 2009.

personalfinance,Did Fedloan screw me or did I screw myself?,"Hey everyone! 

Being an avid lurker on this subreddit has inspired me to pay off all my debt and in the last year my credit score has raised almost 100 points. With that being said, though, I'm still only at an average of 620 between all of the bureaus. 

My student loans have been in deferment since the payments started. I couldn't afford to pay them, so the smartest thing for me to do was to put them in deferment. From May to September of 2017, I had NO idea they had come out of deferment until I got a letter in the mail in September. As I'm sure all of you know, the government doesn't just give you one student loan, they give you multiple. I had 8. Which means that I technically missed 40 payments. I put them back into deferment as soon as I realized all of this, but it COMPLETELY killed my credit and I'm wondering if there is a way to get these removed from my credit report? Or am I just screwed?

personalfinance,Get a mortgage or be debt free?,"I am 14 months away from being completely debt free.  I have good credit and FICO scores now.  I am considering buying a house, have been approved for financing, and even found a house that looks good.  I have not put in an offer or done an inspection.

Under my current payment schedule, in 10 months my oldest debts on my credit report (student loans) will be paid in full, and the accounts will close, reducing my credit score.  In 14 months my car will be paid off and that account will close leaving me with no open accounts on my credit report.  I do not use credit cards.

I have a small windfall, that I can either use as a down payment on a house, or wipe out the student loans and most of the car loan.  I will get a decent tax return and can put that to the remainder of the car loan, clearing my entire debt as early as February.

Is it better to buy a house now while my credit score supports it, or wait until I am out of debt and have a house-sized emergency fund?  I also hear interest rates and home prices are raising, and i dont want to pay way more for the house because of waiting.",finance

personalfinance,Should my in-laws transfer credit.,"Greetings PF.
So my in-laws asked me for advice on their credit cards but I have limited knowledge on the subject.

Basically they have two cards 
Card 1- $15,000 at 12% interest
Card 2- $5000 at 7.2% interest

Here is where the questions come in.
They got an offer for from the same company as card 2 except with a fixed interest of 6.9%  for the life and a limit of $12,000 with no balance transfer fees. 

The idea is to take the offer and transfer $6000 from card 1 to the new card 2 (now having ($5000 at 7.2% and 6000 at 6.9% on it) thus reducing the amount on card 1 to $9000 at 12%.

Some of the questions are what are pros/cons of doing this?
On the new card 2 how does it calculate the new interest rate between the two? Is it the average of the two rates?
Would it be better to ignore the offer and maintain the minimum payments on card 1 while trying to pay off card 2?

* Do I pay off the credit card with the $300 limit (""saving"" $25/mo.) and keep the rest as an emergency fund?
* Do I pay off the credit card with the $300 limit and put a double monthly payment toward my highest debt (like the loan?) and move the rest to savings? (con: would have to 'keep ahead' to sustain this)
* Do I keep it all in savings because I have no emergency fund?

34 year old living in Houston, TX. Great job paying ~170k.  Over the past 5 years salary has steadily risen. I expect my earning potential to rise to ~185k next year. 

Within the next 18 months I plan to switch jobs with the new job targeting a slightly lower base salary (~165-175k) but a guaranteed bonus of 30-50k/year. 

Today I’m currently contributing 11% to 401k. Will max it out in 2018 for the first time. Last year I started a traditional IRA and contributed 5,500. I’ll contribute another 5,500 this year.  401k balance is around 100k today. 

I tend to save about 1500-2000/month on top of what is contributed to my 401k.  I like to think I’m fairly conservative financially and saving is important to me. I’m also starting to realize that I don’t want my life to pass me by without spending some of what I’m earning. 

Other notes

-	Wife and 1 kid (5 years old)
-	Mortgage - 140k (~1200/month)
-	Car - 5k remaining at low interest rate (~300/month)
-	Emergency Savings - 25k
-	Savings - 55k
-	No other investments

Short Term Goals

-	New car. Targeting around a 40k expense. Would want to put ~20k down simply because I like the concept of low monthly payments.  Current car worth 12-20k (trade in vs private sale)
-	Housing renovations. Need to plan for 15k of household renovations in next 12-16 months (flooring, fencing, etc). 
-	Life Insurance - I have a standard policy through work, 1.5x salary. Wife would have low earning potential if something were to happen to me. 

Longer Term Goals

-	New house - Current house is entry level. Targeting 300k house within next 5-8 years. 
-	College fund - 5 year old. Have 13 years left to plan this out. Nothing is set aside today specifically for this. 
-	Retirement - Goal is 5 million. That 5 million is an entirely made up number. Maybe to much, maybe not enough. Have the goal of retiring around the age of 60-62, would like to have the ability to really live and travel. 

Now, the questions...

-	Any general comments given notes above?

personalfinance,Denied a credit limit increase because my utilization is too low - Capital One,"Title says it all but I’m wondering the best way to go about the conversation with customer service. 

The card in question is almost 20 years old and I am repeatedly denied credit increases for it- it sits at $1750, has a high interest rate that doesn’t decrease and goes unused for this reason.  I use it so rarely that a customer retention specialist called me about 18 months ago to ask how they could get me to use more credit with them- I told them I would if they’d increase my credit line and was told they could not do that. Frustratingly, I have had fraudulent cards opened in my name with CapOne in the past ($40k and $35k Credit lines, respectively), as recently as a year ago which while irritating and a pain to deal with, is a testament to my credit worthiness and in line with my other credit limits. 

Any suggestions or talking points to how I can work this in my favor when talking to customer service? I haven’t closed it because it’s my oldest line of credit at 19 years.

personalfinance,"Questions for ""extra"" loan payment and retirement contractions","QUESTIONS are about if I should pay more to student/car loans or add the ""extra"" money to traditional IRA?

Some info:

\- 27/Single/Head of Household because I pretty much pay for my mom/ California  
\- Total income $136,000 (3 jobs); Monthly Income $11300 pre-taxed  
\- I fall into the 24% tax bracket currently, but I pay a little more just for my peace of mind, so I say 25%  
\- I have not started contributing to any 401K or IRA yet, but I will start in 2019. I plan to make the full 401K limit  ($19000) thru my company. 8% contribution due to them matching 100% up to 3% and match 50% up to 5%.  
\- After monthly expenses, taxes, and 401K contributions, I'd say my take home is around $4,500 per month ($54,000 / year) that I will just shove into my savings.  
\- Current Savings/Emergency fund $50,000 in just a regular banking savings account.  


QUESTION 1: According to my  research and very nice people on this subreddit, I learned that I would not quality for the Roth IRA, but but a traditional or a ""back door IRA"" - which I am very fuzzy about.  Say I do the traditional, is there a limit per year I can contribute?  What are the tax benefits?  


QUESTION 2: Should I squirrel some of that ""extra cash"" that I take home per month to paying down some of my student loans earlier?  I have 7 student loans, all federal, majority are fairly low interest.  I currently pay $310 per month and plan to just ride it out for the next 9 year (im heading into my 2nd year of repayment).  Here's the breakdown of the loans:  


$5099.03 @ 3.51%  
$6686.29 @ 3.51%  
$1937.14 @ 3.61%  
$4706.83 @ 3.15%  
$727.87 @ 3.15%  
$2135.44 @ 4.24%  
$3035.16 @5.35%

  
QUESTION 3: Same question as number two but regarding my car loan. I have two cars (one for my mom), but that one is 0% interest so doesn't benefit me to pay it down quickly (5 year repayment plan).  My other car has remaining $12762.90 @ 7.9%.  (I've paid 23 of 72 months)

  
QUESTION 4: Should I put some of my current savings into an IRA?  If I was in a state of unemployment or anything, I would manage my monthly expense and be frugal and bring it down to around $3,000 (includes all my expenses as well) versus the current $4,000. People keep saying I should only have 6 months emergency fund so that's around $18-20K, so I'd still have ""extra"" $30K, what to do with that?

CryptoCurrency,Got in a while ago. Held on. Lost 60% of my invested capital-which was higher then my risk tolerance. Learnt lessons from this.,"And i learnt that i should have stuck to my initial risk tolerance- of “ok to lose this much without feeling guilty” stuff.

Kinda too late now. Learn from this people. 

This year was a lesson in greed, misinformation,lack of any good news( bad news took over) too many broken issues that broke the public trust( breaking/stealing of coins) and scams, dumbass community fighting( Roger ver/BCH bullshit) 

Also to stop living in a fantasy world. Understand the issues. Crypto needs to be democratized- its got no “ laws” in place which makes it hard to trust the “community”

Yes- some coins have NOTHING wrong with them- and in time they will survive- as they are now just being pulled down by the massively negative sentiment on the whole community. 

Regulation is a need now- to atleast change the perspective of the people.

A year ago. We were the shit. The entire world atleast heard of something called as ‘ Crypto’ and were fascinated. 

Now- they are apprehensive( and the price shows)

So attack the root causes of this decline. Understand the issues rather then deny it. 
If people are walking away- ask them why? Emphasize with them. 
Their reasons may not be “ correct” or maybe based on misinformation( TOO MANY FAKE news sources - Reddit is example of that), but instead of blowing up on them ( as i have seen all over here- with comments like “ get out” we dont need you” etc )  bring them in. And fix the issues( if there are multiple reports of the same issue)


These reasons dont work for you- but if someone is investing MONEY into an idea/belief/product/vision its a big deal- respect them. ( whatever might be their reason.)

Basic fundamentals of this community has to change. Recognize and accept the problems of the tech, the community,integration issues, market sentiment, regulations Nd people like Roger ver- this decline was caused by the BCH bullshit and i guess that was the last straw. 

The IT bubble had the same effect. It did come back- and now rules the world- BUT MASSIVE changes were made to the rules/ laws and Many MANY regulations were put in place for it to survive- AND oh so it did- and thrive.

REGULATION is now an important topic in this community- and the market is now talking- we need it now. 

Long story short- we may need a governing body-that might “ govern standards” . 

And just because someone is saying it doesnt mean it has to be like the “ Fed”. Lets not assume all governing/regulation agencies are bad. 

Else we would all be living in chaos. 

Crypto is now a household name- time to clean it up- swallow hard pills, adapt and be a robust system. We will prevail- but its gonna be a long road- and come back hard!

Also- lets respect the opponent- the Fed and Fiat. Its gotten a few centuries start, we need to live WITH it not KILL the Fiat for Cryto to live.",cryptocurrency

Background:
-28 yrs old with a wife and 10-month-old baby boy in Oakland, CA
-New job starting next Monday (contract position, likely will be full time after 6 months)
-Daily commute is 30 miles one way
-Currently own a 99 Toyota 4Runner (16mpg average) &amp; a 94 Honda Accord (25mpg average)

Current Monthly Expenses: 
-Rent: $2,000
-Gas: $300 (by using the Honda to commute to work &amp; 4Runner with the baby)
-Cell phones: $175
-Gym: $50
-Car Insurance: $46 ($275/6 months)
-Car Registration: $10 ($120/year)
-Home essentials (diapers, body wash, paper towels, detergent, etc.): $150
-Netflix: $8
-Misc/Fun/eating out: $200
-Car payment: $0 
-Savings: Whatever is left over.
Total = ~$2,958

Monthly Income: 
-$32/hr, so ~$4,000/month (as a contractor employee)

Savings: 
-$5k in Emergency Fund (so far...)
-$4,500 in 401k (not able to contribute at the moment, until hired on full time at work)

Details: 
-The 1994 Accord (25mpg average) is slowly leaking oil, and isn’t the prettiest...dents, broken antenna, and automatic windows are on their last leg. Doesn’t feel the safest for the baby.

-The 1999 4Runner (16mpg average) is in great shape and is the vehicle we use when driving the baby. It just hurts knowing I could be getting much better mpg’s. Especially when we take our monthly 160mile trips to see family. 

I’m looking at selling the Honda (KBB value is $900) and getting a 2008+ Prius. I have considered spending anywhere between $4k to $10k (and financing...I have excellent credit. So with a 3.11% interest rate, 20% down and a 4 year loan would equate to ~$177/month for a $10k car. 

The cost of total monthly gas (1800 miles for me) would be about $150 in a prius. So including a loan, this comes to ~$327/month total. Where as my gas alone in the cars I currently own comes to $300/month. 

Would getting a used Prius be a wise financial decision? Should I spend $4k on an older Prius and have zero car payment, or $10k on something newer? I know Prius’ get a lot of hate, but I’d be willing to put my ego aside if its the smarter move in the long run. My main factor for considering this is the reliability, being I have a 10 month old son...plus the gas savings. I just don’t feel like the old Honda is the safest vehicle for him to be riding in...

Any advice?

personalfinance,Options Besides Closing a Credit Card,"Long story short, I hate my Capital One Platinum card like you wouldn't believe. Problem? This is the first credit card that I opened when I was 18-years-old. 

I currently have about 4K sitting in a savings account. I was thinking about using if for a trip, and opening up a Roth IRA with Vanguard.  However, with the CC card, I owe about $1489.  They currently charge me around $37 dollars in interest rates. I got them to lower the interest rate once, but only for six months, then it goes back up.  There is also this (WTF) $60 a year member fee. It says it on the statement. They charge me $5 dollars a year.  I hate this card so much. Not surprised why I got it at 18. No perks, nothing. I travel a lot, but don't make enough and have too much student loan debt to qualify for the greatest travel cards.  I want to pay off this card in full, but a part of me is a little scared, because I once had a fraudulent charge on it which maxed the card out, and it took FOREVER to sort it out. (Unlike AMEX).  

If I could, I would close it. But it's obviously not a good idea given that the credit score might tank. Are there any other options?  Should I just bite the bullet?

EDIT: TOTAL INTEREST PAID THIS YEAR ALMOST $500! Earlier this year, I was only working part-time so I couldn't afford to pay if off. I'm paying this card off, and I think I'm going to close it. It's my only Visa card, though, I will have to find another one.  I will close this POS card, take the credit score punch after I can (hopefully?) qualify for another card.",finance

Most of Oil companies I looked at, even though they dropped 70%+ of their value since 2014, their price stayed consistent for 3 years now with hardly any volatility. Most of them offer a very good dividend.

&amp;#x200B;

4 companies I looked at have &gt;13 P/E, very positive ROE &amp; ROI, with 0 debt. Cons being low share price, low market cap and low volume.  
$PBT $SJT $MVO $CHKR

&amp;#x200B;

You could say well they havent grown for 3 years so its isnt a good long term investment but what if they do grow, due to them being low price share 10$&gt; few cents up is already a big profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

If they stay same for another year well then dividend will be a nice profit.

&amp;#x200B;

If they drop another 70% of their value, havent thought of that to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

But on positive say you invest $1200 into MVO (147 shares) a year from today it stays the same value around 8$, in last 3 years their dividend average is 0.846. Thats 124$, pretty much 10% annual profit on your initial 1200. If stock moves up few cents even better. Of course you could lose everything too, but thats the risk.

Am I thinking this right or am I completely wrong and 10$&gt; stocks are big risk not worth taking especially with oil and rising renewable energies?

However, I might be stupid + naive, but I just do not feel that is correct. I feel I am in a relatively high tax bracket now, and according to a 2018 tax return calculator, I'd save $5.6k/yr in federal taxes if I contributed $18.5k to a traditional 401k instead.

stocks,Thoughts on Inverse Bond ETFs,"Hi, first let me give some context about my situation and how I've come to consider inverse bond ETFs. I'm in my mid 20s and I have started investing recently (2018). I traded stocks earlier this year and I have made some money( my portfolio is &lt;10k). Then towards late September I cashed out as I had a bad gut feeling about excessive valuations (that was mostly luck tbh). Now after seeing the performance of the stock market in October and November, and the calls for a recession in 2020 I remain pretty bearish. I am mostly in cash and considering save havens like gold (my risk tolerance is low).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However doing some research, I saw that inverse bond ETFs and ETNs have had very good returns YTD (TBF: 9,23%; DTYS; 28,38%; TAPR:33,55%; DLBS: 35.85%; DFVS: 16,78% and several others). Now I am well aware that volatility kills returns in inverse ETFs if held for a long time but these numbers are hard to ignore. Anyhow I have a few questions for more seasoned investors who know these products better:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Have these ETFs performed better than inverse stock ETFs like PSQ simply because the sell off in the bond market has been longer and more consistent in 2018?

&amp;#x200B;

2) This is more subjective but do you think that the expectations of inflation and a hawkish Fed are enough to offset the decay from holding these ETFs long term? (By the way, I am only interested in inverse 1x)

&amp;#x200B;

3) As a follow up to the previous question should I look into ETFs with longer maturities and if so how long 10,20 30 years?

&amp;#x200B;

4) Considering all these factors as well as taxes, is it simply a better idea to hold these ETFs short term only?

It seems to be arguing against the use of index funds in lieu of a more active approach. Rather than poorly summarizing it, I'll just quote it in its entirety below. I won't link to the original comment as I don't think it's necessary to call out a user and I'm sure it could be found easily enough anyways: 

&gt; &gt; I thought pretty much any sensible investor these days would only be interested in practical long term investments (eg. low cost ETFs)
&gt; 
&gt; Think about that for a moment, though. If you invested in the S&amp;P 500 in 1996, by 2001 you would have had a net-loss. Then, as you made that money back again, by 2008 you would have been wiped out (again).
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, if you invested in 1996 by 2009 13 years later, you would have had absolutely NOTHING to show for it.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, of the last 9 years of this propped-up bull market stimulated by Quantitative Easing, you would have made a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; But the Fed has recently shut off that tap. They're no longer flooding money into the market anymore, they are not buying treasuries and MBSs anymore, and they have started unwinding their balance sheet and raising interest rates.
&gt; 
&gt; Fact is, we're about to see a 25% to 50% retracement over the next 2 or 3 years. The bull run is done.
&gt; 
&gt; We have already ERASED all the gains we've made in 2018. And they were erased in about a two week period.
&gt; 
&gt; So, if you had invested ALL THE WAY BACK in 1996 you would have seen a modest gain on your investments, after the accumulated wealth of all your investments had been cut in half 2 times (soon to be a 3rd).
&gt; 
&gt; But what if you invested in just the last five years? You're about to have a net loss.
&gt; 
&gt; So, the old ""buy and hold"" strategy DOES work, if you're willing to wait three to four decades to see any meaningful returns.
&gt; 
&gt; But in reality, it's just a strategy. And it's a strategy that -- even on 10-year to 30-year time-scale -- is only profitable depending on WHEN you got in.
&gt; 
&gt; Further out? To 40 years to 50 years? Sure, you'll be up...but at what age did you start investing? When you were 20? or 30?
&gt; 
&gt; Or did you start - like many did - when you were 45 to 50?
&gt; 
&gt; There are many strategies for reliable income (Options Credit Spreads for example) on a weekly or monthly basis.
&gt; 
&gt; And then there's the fact, that plenty of people have some extra money sitting around and they enjoy speculating.
&gt; 
&gt; Even if you're right on speculation only 40% of the time, if you employ a 2:1 risk/reward, you can be highly profitable year in and year out.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I only trade derivatives. I will never touch actual shares of stock - ever. Not for trading and not for buy and hold. My chosen investment vehicle is Real Estate.
&gt; 
&gt; So it's kind of a cop-out to say ""Why don't people just throw all their money into an Index Fund and keep it there forever?!""
&gt; 
&gt; Depending on when you start throwing your life's savings in an Index fund, that could be very dangerous. And depending on WHEN you start investing, it could be downright pointless.",finance

Bitcoin,"Gold, Bitcoin, USD, and Inflation","Hello everyone. I would like to post a little bit of research I've conducted about Gold, Bitcoin, the USD, and inflation.

First I'd like to define what inflation is. I'm not talking about the Consumer Price Index (CPI), or the Personal Core Expenditures Index (PCE). These are measures of a change in the relative price of a chosen selection of goods. They are often used for headline inflation numbers, and a modified version of the PCE is what the Federal Reserve currently uses to help gauge ""inflation"" in the United States. This is that 0% to 2% figure you often hear about.

I'm talking about monetary inflation. This is the inflation of the supply of money, also called ""money stock"", for a given currency. If there are 100 dollars and we print 5 in a year we have a monetary inflation rate of 5%. This is important because if all five of those dollars went to a hermit in the woods they would have no impact upon price levels. All else held equal this would result in a price-level inflation rate of 0% v. a monetary inflation rate of 5%. This is very important to remember as we talk about the individual currencies.

Gold. Gold is the old-school currency that pirates and nations fought over for a long time. As far as I can tell current supply is stated to be around 170,000 tonnes. 1 tonne is 35,274 ounces, and one ounce of gold will cost you about $1250 in today's market. Add all this up and we come to a total gold market capitalization of  about $7,500,000,000,000, or $7.50T. Depending on who you ask about 2500 to 3000 tonnes of gold is mined annually, or about 1.5% of the current supply per year.

Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the new-school currency that a lot of people have a lot of differing opinions on. Current market supply is around 17,400,000BTC and the price as of this posting is about $4,000 per coin. This gives us a market capitalization of a little less than $70,000,000,000, or $0.07T. Current production is around 657,000BTC per year for an inflation rate of around 3.8%. This rate will cut in half around May of 2020 at a supply of around 18,400,000 giving a new inflation rate of roughly 1.8%. This rate will again halve around 2024 to around 0.8%.

United States Dollar. The USD is one of the most accepted fiat currencies worldwide. International business is often conducted in it, and commodities are often priced in it. There are currently around $14,275,000,000,000, or $14.28T, outstanding according to the US Federal Reserve's M2 Money Stock publication. With some variation this amount has grown somewhere around 5% to 6%/yr for nearly 80 years on the long-term average. This 5% to 6% figure is our monetary inflation rate for the USD.

Here is a table to compare these figures. The final figure is the number of years for the supply to double.

Measurement | Gold | Bitcoin | USD
------------|-------|---------|---
Inflation   |1.5%   |3.8%     |5.5%
Market Cap  |$7.50T |$0.07T   |$14.28T
Supply 2x  |~48yrs\* |~19yrs\*\*  |~13yrs

\* Gold's supply is limited by how much there is in the ground. This amount is not agreed upon.

\*\* Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21,000,000 coins that will be reached some time around the year 2140.

I will refrain from drawing conclusions here as that is not my intent. I provide this information in the hope that you, the reader, will look further into these three units, their history, context, and use, and draw your own conclusions about their future.

&amp;#x200B;

Who wants to discuss how they were right all along? People can learn something from us. It's time. What sort of resistance and scorn did you face on the road to $20k ?

&amp;#x200B;

Me? I always saw Crypto as a spec. bubble. I knew these CluckCoin ICO's were a money grab.      Pure tulip mania with celeb rappers and everything.PT Barnum lives on!

I am vindicated after being called an old-economy fool.A dummy still using ""outdated"" status-quo credit cards to make simple transactions.Well, I don't feel dummy now.

Hodl new global economy!

&amp;#x200B;

All these genius SV VC tekkie podcasters touting the future like Orwell.

*""Innovation is everything. Everything is innovation!""*

They were visionaries, leaving all the old economy Luddites behind.Where are all these smug 25 year olds now?

Welcome to grown up, your first bear market, kiddo.  Wealth building is more complex than buying tulips, ain't it, son?

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017, you were reminded of the .dom bubble, and saw clueless naive retail investors were buying Bitcon

&amp;#x200B;

In 2018, you saw history repeat, and the .com aftermath play out again, as the suckers will hodl to the bottom.Typical mindset is *""I will not sell at anything below $20k!! Bitcon will rise again""* Sure it will, buddy. Those of us who have seen bubbles past have seen this thinking over and over.It never ends well.  

&amp;#x200B;

Replace the USD Fiat?  Umm, no.People think they understand monetary policy by reading a Wikipedia page?

&amp;#x200B;

Who can agree that Crypto is a failed technology ?9 years, and it has basically zero adoption. Just a novelty gimmick.Real technologies that add value are adopted instantly (WWW, smartphones, etc)On the other hand, Crypto is a joke ""technology"".It's slower, more complex, and more costly ($50 a transaction!)Anyone who thinks Bitcon will get adopted does not have the first clue about how technology works

&amp;#x200B;

We can also agree that Crypto is also a failed speculative vehicle.It is 80% off the high.   CluckCoins are even closer to 90% off their highs. The public will never pile in with FOMO again.So, it's game over as far as tulip profits and lambo lattes.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, the crypto crash has arrived, and it took a year. We can speak freely now. How do you feel about the latest correction, and how tulip investors hodlings have been demolished. Again.",finance
crypto_currency,SUQA revitalizes profitability of mining for many users.,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lk5bjvbm8k021.png

Hello, guys!

Today I want to talk about a serious topic - the profitability of mining because of the long bear market. It is no secret that today all cryptocurrencies that include PoS, PoW and masternodes are experiencing serious problems. Many users do not understand what is happening in the cryptocurrency mining market now, as prices have dropped very much and people have practically abandoned mining. By the way, recently watched a video on twitter about how [chinese throw away ](https://twitter.com/DoveyWan/status/1064878600594305025)[ ASIC miners to the dump.](https://twitter.com/DoveyWan/status/1064878600594305025)

[Bitcoin Network Hash Rate Down 25 Percent from Peak](https://i.redd.it/8neg4b4pok021.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, the situation is really sad, but do not despair, because recently there was a new coin on the GPU and CPU mining market called [SUQA](https://suqa.org/). The developers of this coin were able to launch a new POW mining algorithm called **X22i**, which revives the profitability of mining for many users. I was immediately interested in this algorithm.

**X22i** is an unique PoW algorithm developed by the SUQA team. It is worth noting that at the moment X22i is the most energy efficient of all the algorithms on the market, as it works steeper and does not consume a lot of energy. The algorithm has super stability to ASIC miners and quantum computers.By the way, guys, CPU mining is very easy and available from the desktop wallet. GPU mining is available from open source GPU miners just by adding the server and wallet address.The best hashing miner software for 1080ti is Cryptodredge because it's currently fastest miner for x22i. Here download links [https://github.com/technobyl/CryptoDredge/releases/tag/v0.11.0](https://github.com/technobyl/CryptoDredge/releases/tag/v0.11.0)

https://i.redd.it/70hdspr1ck021.png

**What makes SUQA special?**

It's no secret that today there are many cryptocurrencies, some of which are pacifiers. Undoubtedly this is a sad statistics. SUQA developers plan to become a leader in the cryptocurrency market by creating a decentralized ecosystem for various charitable organizations and blockchain startups.

Developers reward miners with SUQA tokens for the speedy implementation of their plans. They take a 10% сommission that will be used to fund developers and their various purposes, such as marketing companies, exchanges listing, website development, legal fees and bounties campaigns.

SUQA coin has a high transaction speed - 533 per second. This is 75 times higher than bitcoin! Today, this fact is a serious advantage over the main competitors.I am sure that this is not the limit of possible speed for developers and it will be even more in the future. There are practically no transaction fees in the SUQA ecosystem. It's really great, guys!

It is important to note that SUQA Foundation is only 2 months old, but it already has a large multilingual community in social networks. The project has an open team for all users that unites them from all over the world. SUQA is a global ecosystem that attracts not only experienced miners, but also more newcomers.

**Investment potential.**

Now the market situation makes us look for new options for investment. There are very few really promising projects on the market that have so many prominent features, one of which is time locked interest. It provides all users with a guaranteed opportunity to earn from their term deposits up to 5% per annum when time locked up to 4 weeks. But there's more! The developers provide an opportunity for early investors to receive an interest rate of 25% during the first 3 months! Looks attractive, doesn't it?I am sure that you should not worry about your deposit, because the developers of SUQA already have serious partnership agreements with a very fast, secure, private and automated deposit escrow service. The SUQA wallet also has a time-lock interest that can be used for all business or private transactions.

In short, the developers of the project have all the prerequisites to become one of the leaders in the mining market, so SUQA is an ideal project for investment. Going forward, I have no doubt that SUQA Team will continue to follow through on roadmap plans as they have done so far.

&amp;#x200B;

[Mooooon - Sooooon](https://i.redd.it/fh2l6udad6121.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

SUQA is a highly potential coin with a new algorithm that will bring GPU and CPU miners to life again, after of months the market are in a down trend, many miners now are stopped in mining alts (except big miners). I'm sure this coin will bring a real hope in mining industry again.

personalfinance,Retirement Funds for nonresidents (international students),"Hi yall,

&amp;#x200B;

I’m currently living and working in California and pursuing an H1-B and a green card. At this point in time, there’s a lot of uncertainty regarding my future retirement plans, but I have a very specific question regarding withdrawing money from 401(k) and IRA accounts in the future if I’m no longer living in the United States.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that if I’m located here by the time I retire and I have invested in a traditional 401(k) I will have to pay Federal and State income taxes based on wherever it is that I choose to retire. What about the State income tax if I’m no longer in the US and I have never been a resident of any state I’ve ever worked in? If I withdraw from a traditional 401k overseas after hitting the appropriate age, I know I will have to pay Federal Income Tax on any distributions I make that year. But will I still be subject to the Californian State Income tax just because this is where I most recently lived before leaving the US? What is the policy there?

&amp;#x200B;

Is it smarter for me to pay all of the debt off myself (assuming an interest rate of 5-9%) and let the fund continue to grow until I want to buy a house, or should I use the fund (portfolio performance at around 10%) to pay off a big portion of the loans and get to live debt free much sooner? I’m not sure which option will leave me better off financially and I have no idea if this is worth meeting with a financial advisor.

personalfinance,"What to do next? Focus on paying off 4% interest student loan, 401K maxing or just save?","Hi PF -

Been a couple years since I last posted. First of all, want to quickly mention how helpful and supportive this sub has been in the past. When I last posted my wife and I had recently married and were just getting serious about PF. At the time, we were saddled by substantial student loan debt from our graduate educations - $170K total student debt. Due to the advice we received from this sub, we got our shit together, utilized the snowball method, lived frugally and managed to pay off $100k of student loan debt principal in 2.5 years. Hurrah!

&amp;#x200B;

We currently have 1 loan remaining, which we recently refinanced at a great rate: 15 years, $70k @ 3.95% interest, $523 minimum monthly payment.

I can provide a better breakdown of monthly expenses, but to keep this short each month living comfortably -  after rent, bills, food, health insurance, the loan minimum, some entertainment/fun money, etc. we have about $2,500-$3k in excess cash remaining. We can get this as high as $3500 need be. I'm stating it as a range since it depends on if we need to make any big purchases. For example I just had to spend $500 on my car after someone hit me in a parking lot and drove off. We live in an expensive city. Rent is $2k a month. We're also going to start trying for a kid in the next year (fingers crossed), and expect daycare to cost $1,500-$2k though we won't be paying this until 2020 at the earliest.

Now that we have a low interest rate just under 4%, My wife and I are trying to figure out what our best course of action is with the extra $2.5-3k we have each month...put it towards our 3.95% interest loan, max out our 401ks or save up since we're planning for a kid in the next 1-2 years? I know there's conflicting viewpoints since it's right around 4%, but given what's going on in the market, maybe 2019 is a good year to focus on paying down the debt/or save?

Any and all advice appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

\-   We started with 3 loans (38k, 62k, 72k); the remaining loan is @ 70k at 3.95% interest

\-   Household income is $160k this year and we're expecting $164-168K next year depending on bonuses

\-   I'm currently contributing 11% of my $80k salary with a 100% match on the first 6% (nets out to $14K per year)

\-   My wife only contributes $200 a month to her 401k ($2,400 a year), mainly because she gets no match and we were focusing on paying off the debt.

\-  Our 401ks currently combine to $59-$60k though I haven't looked in a week given the markets been down-  We are 31 years old.

\-  We have a 4-5 month emergency fund

\- No other debt obligations. Just monthly bills and rent.

personalfinance,Seeking insight for retirement planning.,"Been lurking here for a while and have found loads of great information. However, I’ve been unable to arrive at a satisfactory plan for funding retirement for my spouse and myself and I need some help.

Below I’ve provided a (probably unnecessarily) detailed description of our family’s financial situation. This is a burner account, so I feel ok putting it out there to the world. My description roughly follows the steps listed in the PF Prime Directive.

Our family consists of me (34/male), my spouse (33/female), and our 11-month old daughter. My spouse and I work full-time as public school teachers in NC with low cost health insurance and mandatory pension contributions. 

I began using Mint in 2010 to track my checking and savings accounts (all I had at the time) and added my spouse’s accounts in 2012. The adoption of our daughter at the very end of 2017 added additional health insurance and child care costs to our monthly spending. However, we received substantial raises starting in August. So, looking at the last three months (Aug-Oct) provides the best picture of our current situation. 

Over that three-month period, we had an average monthly income (after federal taxes, state taxes, Social Security and Medicare withholdings, health insurance premiums, and pension contributions) of $5,833.

Our expenses over the same period (calculated using Mint) averaged $4,500. This includes $400/month in Roth IRA contributions for myself and a $100/month payment directly to the principal on our mortgage. 

Our net savings of $1,333 (~29% of total income) is what we expect to be typical for the foreseeable future. We’re not saving the kind of money we were before our daughter came along (that was upwards of 40%), but we knew growing our family would take a toll on our finances and we are 100% happy with our choices. We’re just trying to get our bearings and figure out the best course of action to ensure we have what we need to live comfortably in retirement.

We have a $54K emergency fund in a money market account currently earning 1.5%. A large chunk of this money (~$40k) will be used for a second adoption to take place no sooner than 2020.

Given our mandatory 6% pension contributions, we do not have access to any kind of matching with an employer-sponsored retirement plan.

Our only debt is our mortgage ($610/month, $75,000 balance. 3.75% 2-year ARM). No auto loans. No credit card debt. No student loans. We recognize that we are very fortunate to be in this kind of situation and are thankful for the circumstances that have made it possible.

I have been contributing $400/month to my Roth since 2015. My spouse’s parents opened a Roth for her when she first had earned income (2007) but have not made contributions in years. I have recently opened traditional IRAs for both of us and made the maximum allowable contributions for this tax year. (This might have been premature and not the best use of our funds.)

Here are our current IRA figures with all of the money being held in Vanguard Target Retirement Funds.

Myself
Roth: $21,300
Traditional: $1,500

My Spouse
Roth: $10,300
Traditional: $5,500

We plan to stay in our current jobs until we reach (at least) 30 years of service at age 51 for my spouse and age 54 for myself. As things stand now with state regulations, we will be eligible for full benefits from the NC teacher’s pension program as soon as we retire and will maintain our low cost health insurance for the rest of our lives.

Based on my best estimation, here is what our retirement income will look like without any help from our supplemental retirement accounts. These numbers are pre-tax and do not account for inflation.

$7,000/month (my salary + my spouse’s pension) for two years once my spouse reaches 30 years.
$4,900/month (both pensions) once we’re both retired.

Ideally, we’d like to delay SS until we’re 67 and eligible for full benefits. This will add additional $3,300/month.

NOTE: The pension figures were calculated using the formula provided by the state and our max earnings on the current NC Teachers’ Salary Schedule. Social Security was figured by plugging our historical and projected earnings in the SSA’s downloadable calculator software.

Once we reach age 67, I feel that $8,200/month is a reasonable amount for us to live comfortably. This is where inflation and COLAs starts to make my head spin, so if this is way off, please let me know

The plan I am currently considering would use our supplemental retirement accounts to bridge the gap between retiring at ages 51 and 54 and collecting full SS benefits at age 67. This might not work the way I envision it, so again, feel free to point and laugh.

NC offers a 457 plan that could be used to supplement our income between retirement and age 59.5 when our IRAs can be used without penalty.

The question I cannot seem to answer is how much we would need in our supplemental retirement accounts to fully fund the gap. Specifically, how inflation will determine what those balances need to be. I’ve run all kinds of numbers and am just not confident in what I’m seeing. This is too important to mess up, so I’m seeking input from the Reddit hive mind.

One other consideration is that we’d ideally like to start adding money to our daughters existing 529 (balance of $450). I understand that funding her education at the detriment of our well-being in retirement is not a wise choice, but, if we are able to add some each month, that would be great.

I know the amount we are saving each year (~$16k) will not allow us to fully fund our IRAs nor our potential 457s, much less add a great amount to a 529. Plus, we would obviously want to keep some cash on hand to rebuild our emergency fund after our second adoption. There are areas where my spouse and I plan to cut down on our spending (mainly eating out), but in the meantime, working with the numbers above would be the bare minimum we have.

So, here are my questions for the PF gurus out there. Given everything you now know about our situation, what do you all see as something that I’m missing, have overlooked, or need to rethink? 

How can I go about figuring the balances needed to fill the gap between retirement and SS? Is that strategy completely bonkers? If so, what would be a better approach?

Y’all are an awesome group that has shown support to folks with all levels of personal finance experience. So I can’t wait to see how quickly my plans gets completely ripped to shreds. \s

Thanks in advance!",finance

Banking,Should I apply for a loan at my credit union? (BECU),"Basically, I have a surgery coming up and can't afford to pay for it out-of-pocket because the surgeon doesn't take my insurance. 

Since saving all I make (about $800 a month) isn't an option right now (bills), I'm wondering if I should take out a loan at BECU. I have no idea how they work, what interest rate means, or anything. I know, not off to a good start. But I'm desperate!! :(

I don't have  credit history, if that matters. (I'm only 22 and never had the opportunity for a credit card.)

personalfinance,Is it better to pay off my mortgage faster or invest in stock index funds?,"I've done some calculations to find out whether I'm better off using excess money to invest in stock index funds or paying off my mortgage faster. I've concluded index funds are the better choice right now and just wanted to check with r/personalfinance I'm not making some glaring mistake. 

Assumptions:

* Stock market increases at 4% per year with 3% dividends for total of 7% return on average over the long term (I know the market is way more volatile short-term, but a mortgage is 30 years so that's the time horizon I'm looking at)

* Stocks are buy and hold forever

* Current mortgage interest rate is 4% and variable

* Marginal tax rate 39% (I'm in Australia so tax rates are different, no state taxes, etc)

Calculations:

* If I put $100 extra into my mortgage, I'm saving $4 interest per year

* If I put $100 into the stock market, I'm gaining $5.83 per year ($3x0.61 = $1.83 dividend and $4 in stock price growth)

* So based on the above scenario, I should put extra money into the stock market until interest rates go above 5.83%, at which point I should switch to paying off my mortgage faster

Anything I'm missing?

Edit: Thanks all for the comments so far, to answer a few common questions:

* I'm already maxing my retirement accounts

* I'm actually pretty risk averse, which is the reason I've been putting my money into index funds for the past 10 years instead of buying a house. Buying a single asset in a single asset class, and borrowing to do it? Sounds like the opposite of diversification! But I understand the tax and cash flow advantages of owning your own home now

* I'm not concerned about the stock market dropping, the only way my investments are going to 0 is if literally the entire developed world seizes the means of production or something

* I have enough in other investments that I could pay off ~60% of the mortgage and about half a year of annual leave built up that I could cash out. So losing my job and being unable to afford the mortgage is not a concern",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage points - did I do the right thing?,"Next month we are closing on a new home with a purchase price of a little over $706,000. We are putting down 20% so our mortgage amount will be a little over $565,000. This is obviously a jumbo loan, 30 year conventional. Because of the jumbo status, it’s a bit more expensive and has tighter requirements. One of those requirements is to have 6 months worth of principal, interest, taxes, insurance and HOA payments in reserves, on top of all of the closing pre-paids. We have it, so it’s not a problem. With a credit score of 792, we qualified for 4.87%. 

I (because my husband lets me make all of our decisions, which is great, but also stressful because I go at it alone) decided to purchase .875 of a mortgage point to reduce our interest rate to 4.65% (APR is 4.64%). 

I did some quick math, not utilizing an amortization calendar, wanting to know a ballpark number of how much money that saves on interest each month. I used that number to calculate how long it would take to benefit from spending the $4,900 for the .875. It equates to roughly 6 years.

This is the third home we’ve purchased in 7 years. We lived in our first from 2011-2015, our second from 2016-2018, and now this will be our third. Each move has significantly increased his income ($80,000 per year to $180,000 per year and now this new opportunity is having him on track to make $250,000 per year) so our moves are financially beneficial. Each home sold for more than our purchase price. I’m hoping we can settle a bit and be in the new house for at least 10 years. Given his new role and level of the role, it should be a bit of a wait until the next promotion. But you never know.

Having this information, do you think I made the correct choice to purchase the .875 point? I just question it because we are already putting forward so much money on the table. $4,900 isn’t much compared to the total amount, but I question if it was necessary. We are locked in so I can’t change my mind.",finance

Here are some of the highlights.

1.  ICOs can be securities offerings.
2.  Tokens sold in ICOs can be called many things but merely calling a token a “utility” token or structuring it to provide some utility does not prevent the token from being a security.
3. ICOs that are securities most likely need to be registered with the SEC
4. If a platform offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an ""exchange,"" as defined by the federal securities laws, then the platform must register with the SEC.

Oh no, ASICs control the market and two sociopaths can fuck the entire market up forking an already fork of bitcoin. Again, enough is enough. Too many long term hodlers who bought in early are telling you that the entire crypto space lives and dies by BTC, why does this have to be true?

personalfinance,Best options for paying back student loans,"Hi everyone. I had a few questions on paying back my student loans, and just wanted to make sure the choices I am making are the correct ones in paying back my loans in the most efficient way. I have a few high interest rate private loans (above 7%) and some lower rate federal ones (below 5%). I am trying to pay back my loans aggressively with the avalanche method.(Also I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting, TLDR below.)


I recently found out the interest on my loans will capitalize when I go into repayment starting next month. My initial thought was to pay off all this interest before it capitalizes which is about $4500, but then I realized if I'm putting any money into my loans before repayment then I should only be paying off on the highest interest rate loan. I've already paid off most of the interest on the highest rate loan, so I would be paying principal on my highest interest rate loan vs interest on all my other loans. Is this thought process correct?


On a somewhat similar note, I was originally going to pay my federal loans on the standard 10 year repayment plan. But I can also use a graduated plan to make smaller payments now but larger ones in the future at the cost of paying more interest over time. In the first two years this would probably only be a difference of around $80 a month, but if I take that $80 and apply it to my private loans instead then overall I would be saving on interest in the long run. Is this also correct? 


Thanks in advance for any advice!


TLDR: Should I pay off principal on my highest interest rate loan vs paying off interest on all other loans before they capitalize? Should I do a repayment plan that lessens my federal monthly payments so I can pay more on my private loans instead?",finance
personalfinance,How to handle money gifted for marriage,"My wife is a non-US citizen, currently waiting for a Green card (we have submitted the application). My parents gifted us $30,000 for our marriage. We want to save it towards a down payment on a house, probably 3-4 years down the line. I currently have a savings account open with Ally under my name. Ally will not let me open a joint account with my wife until she gets her green card (she cannot open her own with them either).

According to the IRS, my Dad can gift me $15,000 in 2018 and it would be tax exempt. Can my Dad gift my wife $15,000 as well, or does she not fall under ""family""? 

The plan would be for me to deposit $15k to my Ally account, and then have my wife deposit $15k to her checking account and make a transfer to my Ally account. Would that all be above board and considered tax exempt for my Dad? We would deal with setting up the joint account when she gets her green card but would enjoy the interest rate at Ally in the meantime.

stocks,Is it time to hedge volatile stock holdings with an investment in gold?,"* Lagging and volatile global stocks, a strengthening US dollar, and prospects of slowed interest rate hikes combine to create a potentially bullish outlook for gold prices.  

* From its value of USD$2,925.51 on October 3rd, 2018, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 10.01% to USD$2,632.56/share. Over that same time period, the price of gold has appreciated 1.69% to USD$1,223.38/ounce. A continued downturn in US stocks coupled with a downturn in global stocks will work to potentially drive further appreciation of gold prices.   

* Current high levels of inflation, as indicated by growth in the US consumer price index and producer price index in 2018, should also work to create a favorable environment for gold prices. The United States has seen consumer price index and producer price index growth above 2% for every month of 2018 -- the last time these indicators observed growth in excess of 2% over 10 consecutive months was from June 2011 through April 2012, when the price of gold appreciated by 7.84%, and from May 2011 through March 2012, when the price of gold appreciated by 7.42% respectively.   

* Strength in the US dollar also supports a bullish environment for gold prices.  The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index’s current value of 96.9920 is at the highest level seen since June 2017. Historically, gold prices diverge from the value of the US dollar amid a downturn in the latter.   

* Prospects for deaccelerated interest rate hikes in 2019 by the US Federal Reserve also bolsters a long-term bull case for gold prices. A slowdown in the pace of interest rate hikes by the Fed will likely spark higher inflation of the US dollar, which may cause investors to increase gold holdings to hedge against inflation.  

* While indicators like a strengthening US dollar, volatile global stocks, and high inflation combine to form a bullish environment for gold, supply and demand levels for the precious metal tell a different story. According to GoldHub, supply levels of gold have held steady since 2010 while real demand for gold (by the technology and jewelry industry) has trailed off. Although the current macroeconomic environment appears favorable for an investment in gold, gold supply and demand levels actually work against this thesis. Investors seeking to hedge their stock holdings with an investment in gold should tread cautiously and plan for at least a 1-year holding period.

Does this mean if I do nothing, then 20% of the lump sum will be withheld by the government and then I will pay taxes on that 20% portion? Or is the whole 20% just gone to taxes?

CryptoCurrency,Hold on to your Bitcoins,"A lot of people are saying the world hasn't learned from the 2008 crash, and both the US and Europe have been printing money, artificially pumping the economy up. What comes up must come down and I can see a next crash being even harder then the 2008 one. There are several documentaries about this (the one where Bernie is being interviewed is a good one - I think it's called the big short). Currently the US stock market has been in the longest bullrun then ever seen since the last 3-4 decades. Indexes are at their highest highs, all based on artificially pumped money. Remember, those trillions of state debt the US has are loans to American financial institutes. Those trillions of dollars are part of the huge bullrun and at the same time one day must be paid back - one way or the other. 

Crypto IS a threat to the establishment, as it effectively removes their direct power and control over the (world) economy. No more printing, no more fucking around with interest rates and loans (at least not how it is now). The only way to control crypto is to control it like gold; have a majority in your own hands or have the majority in your own hands in paper (EFT...). Sadly I think EFT and BAKKT are tools to control crypto and BAKKT first saying it would be released in November - then the dump happening - then saying January does tingle my aluminumfoil hat. Still. 

If there were a crash like 2008, the dollar and euro would crash, many banks and financial institutes would go bankrupt (together with any pension funds people still have left). Crypto on the other hand, being a non controlled (at least not directly like Fiat), global phenomenon would most likely become the go to currency to stash away easy to access/convert value. 

Don't fall for the bears. Crypto isn't a loaning scheme of the banks like with housing nor are they Chinese stocks at the NASDAQ. Crypto is decentralized, open source and global. 

Make your bets wisely. The crypto show is far from over. Open sourced, decentralized cryptos do have a future. It's our goddamn right and we shouldn't be handing them over to the ones who are actively seeking to either destroy or control it. Maybe it's too late for that (seeing as the futures are already here and BAKKT is coming), and maybe somehow the big crash that will follow up the 2008 one might not happen or crypto will be killed before it happens. 

Don't get me wrong. There are still a lot of scams within crypto and most crypto are highly overvalued. Shit cryptos shouldnt have marketcaps over a million dollars but they do. When I say crypto, I mean those who are worth it and have a chance actually succeeding. I'm not calling any names for that just divides us (like a certain fork has done), while we should actually unite to create a front against those who are currently taking crypto away from the normal folks. 

It's a matter of chances and choice. Fiat is based on believe on the system and it's worth, much like crypto. Once panic comes, Fiat could crash while the faith in a decentralized currency that is formed from  an immutable ledger might prove more worthwhile. We will see. For now, don't sell ALL of your crypto, else it would just find it's ways in hands of those exact group that causes the last economy crash without losing a dime (or sleep) on it, and who will be causing the next crash too. They can't stop crypto. But they can try to manipulate it, like they've done with gold. 


The choice is yours. Are you giving in to despair? Or are you - once again - willingly to take the plunge?",cryptocurrency

I was hoping you would all have some advice on my situation. Nothing is out of the ordinary, I just am horrible at structuring out a game plan to pay back debt and save. I have tried multiple times, but I just get a lot of anxiety when it comes to creating structure so I am hoping you all can provide feedback and verify that I'm heading in the right direction. My SO isn't the best at this, and my family is even worse with money than I am. Any advice on how to save/get out of the debt I have would be great.

My goal is to pay off all or most of my debt and save 10K as a safety net, and go from there. I have no idea what I should do with money I will have after these to goals are met, could use some advice there as well.

My situation:
I live with my fiancee, I work in sales. Rent plus bills/etc is probably 2K a month. My cost of living is probably 2750 overall per month. I am not looking to kill off my lifestyle to pay debt back faster. I work 12-15 hours a day and weekends, so the ~2750 in change helps keep my head together (Not cooking a lot meals, leisure expenses, etc). All of my extra money is being poured back into paying off debt. (1-2 thousand per month)

- I earn a 65K base + 5-8% commission depending on revenue from the project + project bonuses. 1st year target is 600K, I've done 202K in my first two months so I am expecting to hit 1M my first year. Expecting my first yr to be 120K-160K (low/high) before taxes. However, I will not see commission checks until May 2019, they get backlogged until the project is finished, and my sales part is the very first step. 

- Side gig currently generates $5,500 a month revenue.. I put this all back into the business &amp; pay freelancers. Better ways to do so? I don't think I need to use this money for debt purposes, I haven't yet.

- I have no savings. I just recently opened a 401K, but I am almost 27 and an sinking 5.5% into this currently as I am behind - looking to get this maxed or @ 10% in the next year or two to catch up.


Debt:

- Student Loans (I dropped out of school) I am about 18K in debt with a low interest rate, 3-4%. Have not even started paying this yet.

- Personal Loan - $3,000 with a very high APR (20 something percent) paying 100$ off a month as is my minimum.

- I owe my family 13K and change. This is being paid back over time, but is being paid back after my credit cards. I have some wiggle room here.

- I have about 1K left of credit card debt. This will be paid off by Jan 1.

Upcoming expenses:

- Vacation to Europe for two weeks Dec 30 - Jan 11th. I'll save ~1000-1500 euro/take it from side biz/use credit cards. Flights/hotels are paid already. Thoughts?

Any advice on how to prioritize would be great. Or any options on what investment opportunities are available after I complete my two objectives (paying debt + saving a small emergency fund)

personalfinance,Paying off CC debt with Income Share Agreement Loan,"What I am looking for: Advice on whether this makes financial sense. 
What I am not looking for: Advice that tells me to take a different educational or career path.

Hopefully you can give me some advice. I'm a senior in college who racked up a large amount of credit card debt. My CC debt has been up and down for several years and ballooned during a semester when I took an unpaid fellowship that eliminated my opportunity to work followed by a summer where I took an out of state internship that was paid, but didn't offer a stipend for moving costs. 

I am currently sitting at 13k of mostly subsidized student loans at 5% or lower interest rates. I have $2,000 on a 17% interest rate card with my credit union, $2,600 on a 23.6% card with Discover, and $1,900 on a 26.3% card with Capital One. 

I have the option from my university to take out an income share agreement (ISA) with a minimum loan amount of $5000 that I could then use to pay off my credit cards debt that I am currently struggling to handle. I would then be responsible for paying 1.96% of my future gross monthly income each month for 112 months after graduation. This would be interest free and I would either complete the payments as scheduled or pay x2.5 the original loan to pay off early. 

Is this a wise option? I feel as if I am drowning in credit card debt and as I will have to move and start over in another city to use my degree, I think having my credit card debt hanging over me will be a heavy burden compared to a likely much lower monthly payment with the ISA. I intend to freeze my Capital One and Discover Cards once I pay them off.

personalfinance,Are missed payments what's holding down my score?,"So, I'm in the fortunate position that I won't need to worry about getting my score pulled for credit for nearly 3 years for anything major as I already have a mortgage and am still paying off a car loan at a sub 2% interest rate.  So, at the least, I know I have a few more years of time on my side.  

I was bad with managing my finances in my 20s.  I had built up a solid credit score until a major fuckup on my part about two years ago.  I have student loans and while I pay a single payment that gets distributed across all the loans, they are 8 separate loans.  You guys can probably see where this is going.  I missed payments 3 months in a row and instead of calling them and trying to work something out, I ignored the issue until I got into a better financial position and caught up on my payments.  To my dismay (and to my credit score's detriment) this resulted in my score plummeting, at one point to the low-mid 500s.  I've become a lot more responsible since then, and for all intents and purposes, I believe I have pretty decent factors.  40 accounts in good standing, CC utilization below 30%, average age of accounts at about 6 years, nothing in collections/judgments, etc.  the only bad factor that I really have are those late payments.  My score has gone up and down since then, and over the summer had a high somewhere in the 650s, but is now back down to ~614.  I just, don't get it.  How can I be paying all my bills on time, seemingly doing everything right but not only have my score not continue to climb upward but somehow fall nearly 40 points?  All I can think of is those late payments continuing to stick out like a sore thumb, but even so, I don't get how it would cause my score to fluctuate?  Do I just need to get over it, take a deep breath, and stop following my score so closely and hope that a few years from now it will actually improve?  Because I've now sat a year and feel like there has been little to no positive movement at all.  

The only other big factor I can think of, and I apologize if I buried the lede, was getting a mortgage almost exactly a year ago.  I closed on my home at the end of November 2017.  Needless to say, I've been paying my mortgage on time (and adding a little extra towards principal when possible) this last year.  I don't know if the fact that I now have a home loan on my credit would affect my score in the way I described.

Any advice would be appreciated, but my guess is there really is nothing for me to do but just keep paying everything on time, continuing to pay down the remainder of any loans and credit card debt I still have and hope that my score actually improves before those late payments fall off.",finance

In the beginning she made some payments and stopped.  In the last couple years our tax refund has been offset for this debt.  However I'm unable to determine how to see the current status of the debt and history of any payments.

We created an account at studentaid.ed.gov which shows the amount owed but no history of specific payments.

We attempted to create an account at myeddebt.ed.gov but were unable to because my wife's data was not recognized.

1. We are trying to learn the ground-truth amount owed (principal less some voluntary payments and tax refund offsets).

2. We are also trying to pay the accurate amount in full or payments to the federal entity it's actually owed (not some third party collector), but having trouble determing how/who.

personalfinance,Looking for Creative Financing to Save Grandparents' Home,"First time posting and I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an aunt who has repeatedly taken advantage of her parents (my grandparents) over the years. Years ago she got them to refinance their mortgage to a variable rate one and along the way sold some of their land to a developer and pocketed the money.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandparents live in Illinois and are in their mid 80s with Social Security being their only source of income. Now that interest rates are starting to climb, the monthly payments are too burdensome on their small monthly income. They also haven't been paying the real estate taxes on the home because of a senior citizen law where they are able to defer those taxes but they will have to pay them if and when the house is sold. The taxes are backlogged \~10 years for \~45K. They bought the house back in the early 2000s for \~$150K and financed \~$132K of it. That house is now worth north of $300K+ only for the land (they are one of the last homes to not sell to developers).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my question, is there a way for me \[26\] to finance the remaining \~$90K that they owe under my name or an LLC at a low fixed % without triggering the real estate taxes that they owe? I have \~$70K-80K in cash or short-term investments but would prefer not to put all of it up. Basically the thought here is to ease their monthly payments and when it comes time to sell the home, I can recoup whatever I put in and the rest can go to their estate.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, they could sell it and we are exploring that option but would prefer to give them the ability to live out their days in the home they've lived in for the last 15+ years.",finance

personalfinance,New graduate moving to expensive area for new job,"Hi all, 

I am about to graduate with a professional degree this Fall and am moving to LA. It's a much more expensive place than I have ever lived before, and I want to make sure I'm considering as much as I can about my finances. My after tax salary per month will be about $5500 (I just used a calculator that takes out federal/state taxes, social security, medicare, etc.) and was unsure of what was an acceptable rent. I know the general rule of 1/3 of your salary, but it will be very hard to find housing without a random roommate (I really want a 1 bed/1 bath when I first move there. I have had random roommates in the past and some are great and others drove me insane). Would it be unwise to spend ~$2000 a month for at least a 6 month lease? I know getting a house is currently out of the question (housing prices are simply insane). 

I keep a spreadsheet of all my monthly expenses now (make ~$2000 a month in school) and I currently pay about $500 a month in rent. I've thought about just taking my monthly expenses and adding some multipliers for the new rent amount as well as other general cost of living things (food, water, electric, etc.) Under that consideration, I think I can easily save about $1500 a month, if I'm not living too crazy. Is this a good or bad way to consider this? I feel like I might be ignoring some factor or unforeseen expenses. Should I suck it up and get a roommate or two? It looks like it would cut my rent to less than $1500 a month, and potentially more if I pick a place with an established roommate in the future. 

Does anyone here live in an expensive city with a decent amount of income? Have any tricks to suggest?  

Thanks for any and all advice and replies. I'm just panicking a little bit about the extreme rent prices.",finance
personalfinance,FedLoan: Annual Loan recertification question,"Hello- new poster here but long time reader to reddit.

So I recently got married in March 2018, and I had to do my annual loan recertification for December 2018. For the last year I’ve been on the REPAYE plan, but I know that they will use my spouse’s income to calculate my payment. With this in mind, I went on studentloans.gov and I requested to switch to a new income driven repayment (IDR) plan that had the lowest monthly payment (I want low monthly payments since I’m going for public service loan forgiveness), which would be Income Based Repayment (IBR) plan. I checked the box that requested that they choose the plan with the lowest monthly payment. In this process, I checked that my marital status was “married” but I filed single on my tax return for 2017. Regardless, they still requested that my wife co-sign the Loan and link her IRS information. 

Fast forward a month and FedLoan kept me on REPAYE and made the payment to that of my spouse and my combined salaries so it sky rocketed a few hundred dollars. I called FedLoan and they said that they made a mistake in reviewing my application, and they would put it under review so that it can be switched to IBR.

After this phone call, I called a second time and the FedLoan lady told me that since I was single in 2017 and filed my tax return as single, I should redo the annual recertification paperwork on FedLoan and say that my marital status is single and I filed single, which would keep me on REPAYE. She added that next year I’d need to switch to IBR since I’d be filing as ‘married but separately’ for my upcoming 2018 tax return. I took down her name and ID # just in case this back fires.

My question is- did she give me the correct information? Do you think that FedLoan will look at my previous application and see that my marital status  was married, but now changed to single? Again- I want the lowest monthly payment that I can obtain since I’m getting somewhat close to PSLF. How should I proceed now that the new application is already in?Thank you all for your help in advance.",finance

economy,U.S. indices aiming for a 5% increase,"A significant market decline often indicates a market correction phase. Last Friday, [index S&amp;P500](https://www.fxpro.com/trading/indices/usspx500) closed on the lowest levels for the last six months, losing 10.2% from the September peaks, and marking its entry into the market’s correction phase.

However, the market reactions so far signal that the demand for stock hasn’t changed, and thus the correction phase may not arrive in the near future, as expected.

&amp;#x200B;

On Monday, index S&amp;P500 has increased by more than 1.5% while the futures for the index have shown an upturn today morning.

Moreover, the technical indicator – Relative Strength Index – highlights the weakness of the downward trend, taking into account the sequence of the highest lows. However, results show a clear divergence from the price dynamics, since the decline in November was much more profound than in October. Often, such a divergence between the price and the RSI precedes a significant, upcoming rebound.

An important resistance area is situated near 2810, which is 4.7% higher than the current levels, and could become a target for the market bulls.

&amp;#x200B;

Among all the support factors, is also the yield decline in the U.S. treasuries, which in turn makes the assets with fixed return less attractive to investors. The yield of 10-year US government bonds reversed to decline from 3.25% to 3.05% twice in November and October, which as a result triggered increased demand for stocks. The latest trigger for the decline was Powell’s recent comments that the Fed could pause the rates' raises next year, in light of the slowdown of the economy.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors should also pay attention to the moderation of the inflationary pressure, after the oil prices collapse. Today and tomorrow, the markets may get further clarification in regard to the Fed's position and the evaluation of the latest data. Later today, the Fed’s Vice Chairman will give out a speech, followed by the Fed’s Chairman, Jerome Powell, on Wednesday. The confident sentiment prevalent in the economy, and the intentions to stay on course, for 3 or more rate hikes next year, may trigger the dollar to see a rally in the future. However, there is a higher probability towards a shift to a more precautionary stance, that can increase the pressure on the dollar and strengthen stocks.

personalfinance,Questions about graduate school funding and loans.,"Next fall, I’m starting a graduate program. My employer has a tuition remission program that covers 100% of tuition and 50% of the fees. I know tuition remission is taxed, but I’m confused about what the tax rate is. My HR and school isn’t helpful, but payroll does deduct the taxes from my paycheck. A coworker who used this benefit said it is taxed as a gift, but that doesn’t sound right to me.

I heard horror stories about the tax rate from other employees, so I wanted to get a student loan to help with my bills while in school. For example, if my tuition taxes is going to be $500 each paycheck for 10 paychecks, I’d get a loan for $5000. Like I said, HR/payroll/financial aid aren’t helpful. What usually happens is you find out the taxes when you get your paystub, but I just want to be able to estimate how much I’ll actually need. How does tuition remission work?

Another question I had is: Is it ever a good idea to use a newer student loan to pay off older ones? I may just accept the maximum federal loan since all of these offices are so secretive. If I do that, I just wanted to know if I should just give back unused funds or pay my unsubsidized loans from undergrad. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,engaged PhD students- what to do with my undergrad loans? how to save for home? retirement?,"Hi r/personalfinance! I've been a long-term lurker and am excited to get some feedback on my and my fiance's personal finance situation. Scroll down for TL;DR

I've been aggressively paying down my student loan debt since 2014 and am finally down to $10k remaining. Fiance is debt-free and we are getting married next fall. **I am looking for advice on a timeline for paying off the $10k, and how to start saving for retirement and a down payment on a house.** I'm tempted to pay off the $10k asap but perhaps saving towards a down payment might be more logical. I'm torn. 

**Background:** I am a 26yo, third year PhD student in the biomedical sciences in a low COL area. My graduate research stipend is $30,500/yr and my fiance is also a third year PhD student in the same field but different university. His stipend is $32k. I will be earning an extra $4k next semester for TAing. Health insurance is covered through our programs with no monthly cost- basically we get free appointments at the student health center, and only pay for the occasional prescription and co-pay at specialists as needed. We share a 2014 car fully paid off. **Post-PhD Plans:** I plan on transitioning into industry positions at a contract research organization (CRO) or biotech company. I am looking at regulatory affairs or project management. I am completing a business certificate through my PhD program where I can take MBA electives through the business school for free. I have a variety of extracurricular and leadership experience on campus outside of basic lab work because I don't want to get stuck being a postdoc earning $45k/yr. My program also offers paid internship programs at local CROs and biotech companies. I expect to make at least $65k coming out of my PhD. We are planning on staying in this area due to low COL. Our other options are to move back to one of our home states to be closer to our families, but we are both from high COL cities so that option isn't as appealing to us. We could get beautiful homes where we currently are for around $200-300k. My fiance has a computational bioinformatics background (Python, R, biostatistics) and could probably get a high paying job in industry but is very passionate about (unfortunately low-paid academic) research so I'll estimate his earning potential anywhere from $60-100k depending on if he stays in academia or goes to industry. Basically what I'm getting at is that for two PhDs, we are rather competitive candidates in our field.

&amp;#x200B;

**Savings:**

Traditional savings account: $25k

Roth IRA: $1k

**Debt:**

Student loans: $10k (in deferment since I'm in grad school, not collecting interest because they are federal subsidized loans, interest rate 3.8% once out of deferment)

**Monthly post-tax combined income:**

$4,100

**Monthly expenses:**

Rent + utilities: $1050

Parking pass: $85

Phone: $75

Groceries: $500 

Gas: $50

Car insurance (paid in full every six months): $75/month

Fun money: $400

Savings towards flights for visiting family/holidays: $160

**Remaining income after expenses:** $1700

**Upcoming expenses to consider:** saving for a second car that we will need after graduating in about 2-3 years, saving for kids in the next 5ish years

**TL;DR** We have $25k saved, $10k in student loan debt not collecting interest for the next 2-3 years, $4k post-tax income, $2k expenses. Should we pay off my student loans ASAP and be done with it? Should we prioritize saving for a down payment on a house over saving for retirement? We will graduate in May or Dec 2021.

personalfinance,I have a shared banking with my father that we have run all of our income &amp; expenses (both personal and business) through for the past 2 years. We have both failed to file income tax. The account is in my name only. How should things be categorized for tax purposes? [USA],"See title.

Without going into too much backstory as to our lack of record-keeping and general negligence (which there unfortunately has been plenty of), we are trying to get ourselves straight for healthcare open enrollment.

We both need to file our federal taxes for the past 2 years. The kicker here is that we have almost exclusively used a single bank account which I am the only signer on to run our business together (which is a sole prop in my name). There are no W-2s for either of us, but there will be a few 1099s into my company name for larger jobs I have been paid on.

Over this period, we have just spent the money and taken draws as needed. Thankfully there is near-zero cash usage or income from either of us, so digging through all my bank records and categorizing should be fairly straightforward. 

My question is, what is the best strategy for how his income should be explained? He has his own living expenses and will also claim my mother as a dependent. We are very close and neither of us have much concern about bearing the tax burden for the other so I'm really just trying to figure out the best way to move forward.

personalfinance,How do new home construction loans work - and what pitfalls to avoid?,"My wife and I initially wanted to extensively renovate our house, but it doesn't seem to be cost effective.  We are looking into building a new house now and have our first meeting with a builder this Saturday.

Before meeting with them, I wanted to know what kind of options there are, and what pitfalls to avoid.  I know the person we will be speaking with will be a salesman to the max.  I'm usually pretty competent in this area, but I'm not sure what they will throw at me.

We will be looking to have the price of the land (that we do not currently own) and house rolled into a 30 year fixed mortgage at the end of the day, but the incremental steps I'm a little unsure of.

Some options we were given on our first call to the lender:

Bridge loan to get construction underway, then 30 year fixed once construction is complete?  Will a bridge loan cover the price of the land as well?

Mortgage to cover anticipated final appraisal to cover land + construction at a higher rate (7.75%), then refinance once complete to the market rate?

HELOC on the equity we have to purchase land and get construction underway?

Also we will be selling our current house which will be the majority of the down payment.  We have 50-75k of equity in the house depending on what it actually sells for.

Total all in budget is 350k - about 55k for the land, 15-20k for clearing and grading (wooded but flat), 10k for septic and well.

With our cash savings + home equity we should have 70k for a 20% down payment by the time construction is completed and our house is sold.

Side note, houses in our current houses price range move very quickly in our area.  I know it isn't a guarantee but ideally we would like to move straight from our current house to the new house, possibly using some sort of contingency.

Thanks for any advice and options I may be missing.

*edit


Follow up conclusion for anyone in similar situations - 


We are getting financing with a construction loan that works as follows:


Builder will give us a blueprint and estimated budget, then lender will loan the entire amount for the land + development + building and downpayment of 5% (of the entire estimated amount) is due at the time of closing on the land.


The lender will release funds as needed to cover the rest of the land (beyond the downpayment) and development of the land.  We will be charged 7.25% interest on any funds drawn.  This builder doesn't require any upfront money for construction, just $1500 to get started.  They won't require anything further until the job is finished.


Once the house is built, we will close with a 30-year fixed with 4.875% interest rate.


We can then move all our stuff into the new house and sell our current house.  Once construction is nearing an end, we will list our house.  At that price point and market, it should move pretty quickly.


Once we close on our house, the lender offers a 1 time recalculation that is free of charge to inject equity from the sale of our current house.  This will adjust the 30 year fixed payments downward, as well as PMI if we are still under 20%, or remove it completely if we cross 20%.


The lender also offers a 1 time, free of charge, interest rate adjustment if market rates drop by a quarter point.
And hopefully that's it!",finance
personalfinance,Refinance Mortgage to pay off college debt,"Hey all, long time lurker, first time poster here. I’m considering refinancing my mortgage to pay off some debt that I have from school. I did the math and it makes sense to me, but I’m worried I may have forgotten to take something critical into consideration. Here’s the breakdown:

&amp;#x200B;

Mortgage ($1,010 monthly w/o escrow)

$164k @5.875% interest

&amp;#x200B;

Car ($500/month)

$23,052 @ 3.09%

&amp;#x200B;

Debt ($600-700/month, total $32k @6.32%)

Student loan - $8.8k @ 3.4%

Student loan - $14.4k @ 5.35%

Credit Card - $8.5k @ 11%

&amp;#x200B;

Estimated home value: $205-211k

&amp;#x200B;

It makes sense to me to refinance my home and use the extra money to pay off everything except for my car so I am saving on interest. With a credit score of 730, I should be able to get a rate somewhere around 5.25%. I see a reoccurring theme in this sub about not taking out more debt to pay off debt. Am I missing something? With the lower interest rate, I estimate my monthly mortgage may be about $100-150 more than it is now but I will have an extra $600-700 saved from student loans and credit cards. I will also save on the interest.

personalfinance,Big Student Loans - What’s the smartest choice to make?,"I (29F) graduated law school in the spring and am now working at a firm making 190k/year. I have about 215k in federal student loans with interest rates between 4.5% and 7.21% with an average of 6.24%. I am at a late starting firm and have been here less than a month. Big overall question- what is the smartest way to deal with these? Should I refinance, should I do that immediately or wait a bit, etc.? 

Key numbers-

Loan payment -currently on repaye so $113 a month. This be recalculated in September.

Credit card debt - about 22k. Now down to 8k

Savings -about 19k. Now down to 5k plus the 6k buffer I always keep in my savings account

401k -just started for the first time. Firm does not match as per normal in Big Law. I’m planning on putting in 18.5k a year regardless of my loans although I’m unsure if that’s really the right choice. 

Options-

1. Stick with federal loans. Pay between $4500 and $5000 a month plus bonuses to loans, directing everything beyond the required payment to the highest interest rate loans. The major benefit is I keep federal protections.

2. Refinance to a 15 year 3.95% rate. Minimum payment would be about $1500 a month, but I would continue to pay about $5000 plus bonuses. If I pay these loans off in 48 months then all interest I have paid above a  1.95% rate will be refunded to me.
To get this rate I have to have 10% of my loan amount in a savings account at the bank. I obviously almost have that amount saved and can have it by December 1st. But I could also choose to pay off credit card debt with some of my savings and wait to refinance until May or so while making more minimal payments on my loans and saving heavily.

Any thoughts (or questions)?",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan debt - refinancing help!,"Hey y'all, hoping to get some advice on refinancing my student loans -   
I'll lay out my situation as best as I can for reference:

I just graduated last year with my BS in Sport Management. During my time in college - I racked up quite a bit of Student Loan due to a combination of things: minimal financial aid, an extra semester or 2 of college, and most importantly - being stupid &amp; not educating myself on how student loans work &amp; the long-term implications. As a result, I applied for several private loans through Sallie Mae (I currently have SM loans) - the interest rates of these loans are sky-high, ranging from 9%-12.5%. The repayment period of these loans vary, but they're all pretty short (7-10 years) - causing my monthly payments to be huge.

Since graduating in May of 2017, I have attempted to refinance my Sallie Mae loans a number of times.   
I was denied on my first try through Citizen's Bank due to my low income at the time (first job out of school was in a high school athletic office - great experience, but very low pay). 

In June of this year I got a job in local government/Parks &amp; Rec which doubled my yearly income. I figured since I was now making more money and had fair credit (just under 700) with no credit card debt or anything like that, I'd have a pretty good shot.  So I started trying again to refinance my loans. I was denied because of my Debt to Income ratio 

NOTE: I do not have a willing cosigner - so this will be all on my own.

  
 Again, for reference:

I have been paying $680/month to Sallie Mae with the varying aforementioned interest rates (Total principle of app. $36k)  
(I also have federal loans that I will start paying on next month - which will be around $325 a month (although they are a bit easier to work with from what I hear).

Just today I got accepted through Advantage Education Loans. But based on the loan terms, I'll be paying significantly more over the life of the loan. 

I was approved for 15 year repayment @ 7.5% (fixed) interest. This would cut my monthly bill in half (from $680 down to $340). But according to my calculations - I'd be paying about $7,000 more over the life of the loan because of the increased repayment term. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked at the pros &amp; cons - I don't like the thought of paying $7,000 more, but it would obviously make my monthly obligation much more manageable. I would be able to put some money into savings, and/or pay extra on my loans.  
Basically, I feel as though my quality of life will significantly improve if I'm able to pay my bills comfortably - which won't be the case if I have to continue to give Sallie Mae $680 every month.

I'd love some advice from people who have refinanced their loans.  
Would it be stupid to extend the repayment term? Should I reapply on a 10 year term? Or would this be a smart move  


Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance! (sorry for the novel lol)",finance
personalfinance,Is zero interest and cash back worth a new credit card?,"I received an offer for for a credit card with almost 0 percent interest rate for 6 months (0.99 to be exact). It also offers cashback on select categories.

I have $10k debt on a line of credit, that I'm hoping to pay back within next 3-4 months, but I estimated I'll pay $150 interest until then.

On the other hand, I've had good credit until recently and don't want to unnecessarily get an extra credit card to affect that.

*Here's what I'm thinking to do. Please let me know if that's a wise choice or it will have adverse effect on my credit.*

I apply for the credit card, put all my existing debt on it and pay it off within the next 3-4 month. This will save me approximately $150 in interest. After that either cancel the card, or continue using it for one of my big cost categories (e.g. gas or auto) and request cashback on that category. The CC allows requesting up to two categories for cashback.

Any input is appreciated. Please let me know if I need to provide more information. I live in Canada and the offering bank is Tangerine.

I didn’t lose my job due to any performance issues, and am currently in the middle of negotiations for a settlement with my former employer. However, the timing for an actual payout seems to be months away.

In the meantime, I have not been able to work due to several acute health issues which have taken the remainder of my money and my car payments are now 3 months behind. My car loan is terrible, interest rate in the high teens, but I needed a car so I took a high interest rate thinking I’d be able to work, but unfortunately I can’t do that right now. As of now, I’m skipping meals and sleep, doing odd jobs, and trying to work on unconventional side projects just to make some kind of dent in my bills, but I am very overwhelmed. My family is not able to help me so I’m on my own on that front.

I can’t say I’ve been the most responsible person with debt and credit due to a constant struggle with adult ADHD that I didn’t know I had until last year. Prior to, I just thought I was a f*ck-up who couldn’t get their life together. My dad was similar, we got evicted a lot and he could never seem to keep things (jobs, rent, etc.) going past about 6 months. While I definitely have improved a lot, I still very easily forget payments, bills, and I know the impulsivity and terrible budgeting of my 20’s and early 30’s has taken a major toll on my credit. I grew up poor, parents were terrible role models, and I only started learning how to manage money this last year with the help of this subreddit and a couple of library books.

Anyway, I’m thinking of voluntarily surrendering the car which leaves me with no transportation in a city with very unreliable public transportation. I don’t want to give my car up because I really have no way to get around to the doctor’s and elsewhere without it, but it doesn’t look like I have much of a choice.

personalfinance,How to tackle the right debt,"Ok, so I’m going to use numbers from someone else’s post as I’m curious of the logic. I understand the basics of personal finance. I was going to post a bit of my own advice on her post but I wouldn’t want to give wrong advice, just because it’s my personal opinion.  (Numbers May not be exact but logic will hold true)

So here’s the situation. I have 28K to either keep or pay down debt, 5K in an emergency fund which we will assume is enough for this person. 

Student Loan 1 - 57K @ 6.5%
Student Loan 2 - 40K @ 6.2%
Mortgage - 130K @ 4.6%
Car Loan - 17K @ 2.5%

Now where should the 28K go. I will give you my logic and and feel free to roast me, help me, whatever, I just want to see if my thought process makes sense as I will soon be in a very similar financial situation with several debts and a large lump sum of money. 

My theory is this - while i agree paying on the higher interest rate will save you more in the long run, is it really the right move as, I assume, payments will stay the same only term will shorten.  So why not pay off what you can which will still leave you with some liquid assets and decrease monthly payments. 

I feel like monthly payments play a huge factor which aren’t given. Perhaps the 17K car Loan has a monthly payment higher than either of the student loans, depending on the structure of the loans. Even if it doesn’t have a higher payment, wouldn’t it be more beneficial to pay off the car loan to give yourself a higher disposable income. 

If the OP of this question can cover all the bills with their income but not have a lot left, wouldn’t it be safer to pay off a looming debt and use that extra monthly income to invest/give yourself breathing room so the emergency fund can last a bit longer?

Maybe I’m wrong and paying down the highest interest debt is the best option here but I would rather have more disposable income and add a bit to the emergency fund from the 11K that is left.  (Also when a car is out of a loan your insurance can sometimes be changed so your payments on it are lowered. I’m in Canada so maybe it’s different for OP in the US). 

Am I wrong in thinking freeing up a loan and more money is the best option? 

Now given the terms of the loan perhaps the payment could be re-negotiated if you put a huge lump sum on the highest interest one in which case it’s an obvious choice. 

But wouldn’t payment amounts be a crucial point to take into consideration before making an actual decision?",finance

personalfinance,Discussion topic - my rational for choosing a Roth over regular 401k,"I have some reasons that I think are good reasons to choose a Roth over a regular 401, at least in my specific example.  I'm interested to see what others think of my rationale.

My situation - I have a decent paying job with a pension that will pay out around $70k or more when I retire around age 60.  My wife also has a pension, but will only be about $15k by then.  We also have quite a bit of money in regular 401ks that will be taxable when we withdraw it.

1)  Due to the ever growing federal debt, I believe tax rates will be higher in the future.  Since our pensions will cover the ""standard"" deductions, our tax bracket will likely be equal to, or higher than they are now.  Paying tax now is better than paying tax later.

2)  Social Security is expected to only bring in 75% of necessary payouts in the near future.  Since no one seems interested in stabilizing it, I imagine the gov't will implement some sort of ""means testing"", whereby those with high income will receive less in benefits.  This already happens by making SS taxable, but I think this will become even more prominent.  Having pensions already puts us into a fairly high income bracket, and if we are withdrawing taxable 401k money, this will just make the problem worse.  Having less taxable income may help prevent our SS from being reduced.

3)  I live in a state with no income tax.  If I put money in pretax now and we move to a state that has income tax, then I'll have to pay state tax on my withdrawals.

Any thoughts or feedback is welcome.

While I figure this can't be a too common scenario as not everyone maxes out their 401k's, I figure it has to happen fairly often for the high savers crowd.

I can only adjust my contributions in increments of 1%, and it usually takes a few paychecks for changes to take effect, so it seems like hitting exactly $18,500 on the last paycheck is an impossibility.

What are my options?  I don't want to leave money on the table from my employer match, and I want to fully take advantage of the 401k tax shelter.  

EDIT: Yes, I understand the employer match does not count against the $18,500.  I'm on track to contribute $18,650 dollars for 2018 (ie $18,650 in employee contributions).",finance

personalfinance,"Was given $25,000 toward student loans where do I start?","My wife has $50,000 in student loans. A friend from our church recently came into a decent sized inheritance and as part of his “tithe” he wanted to give us $25,000 towards our loans. He has seen how crippling it has been for us just to try and pay the minimum payments each month. AWe were totally taken back and cannot believe his generosity. 

We have about $30,000 split up into 3 different private loans and then $20,000 is a single federal loan (this one has the highest interest). 

My wife and I recently were approved for loan forgiveness for the federal loan ($20,000) because we work with a non profit. But we are still 6 years out from having that loan forgiven. (You have to have 120 qualifying payments for your loan to be forgiven, this works out to 10 years of working with a non profit). 

My question is this. Should I be worried about this loan forgiveness not coming through? Our current monthly minimum payment on the federal loan is $0 a month because we are on an income driven repayment plan. So basically it just sits there accruing interest every month. I’m just scared that for some reason in 6 years it might not be forgiven by the government. Maybe that’s an irrational fear. 

So should I put the $25,000 towards the private or the federal loans? I have already tried to call and negotiate lower payout pricing on the loans, but to no avail.",finance
CryptoCurrency,SCAM ALERT (again) - Substratum official ambassador lies about hosting websites on the Substratum network.,"A Substratum ambassador recently made a video demonstrating himself hosting [Substratum.net](https://Substratum.net), [Twitter.com](https://Twitter.com), and a test WordPress site on the Substratum network.

personalfinance,I Shouldn't Begin Student Loan Debt Repayment for at least another year?,"I have just paid off the rest of my unsubsidized federal student loans. I am still in school, and the Great Lakes loan website lists my graduation date as August 2019. This is inaccurate (I am graduating earlier than this, but I don't think I will change it). Now, the subsidized loans do not accrue interest (that I pay) until six months after that (grace period) - February 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

So essentially, I should not begin paying down this debt until ... when, exactly? Average interest rate is 4.17%, and the overall level of debt is around $13k. 

With my position I am beginning in 2019, I could probably pay this down within 12-18 months, starting in January, but I'd like to hear some perspective. Pay it down faster, or take advantage of grace period and pay it off more slowly/wait to begin making payments, assuming a better return elsewhere? Where would this ""elsewhere"" be, do you think?

personalfinance,Question about refinancing student loan,"Hi, I recently received an offer from Citizen's One to refinance my federal student loans (6.6% fixed rate) with them at a fixed rate of 5.3%. I realize this would mean I couldn't take advantage of the loan forgiveness program, but is there any other downside to refinancing into a private student loan?

I'm wondering if there's some other catch I'm not seeing right away since I never refinanced a loan.

Thank you  


Edit: Looking at the numbers I'd probably save $2,000 by making the same payments I'm making today and pay things off in 5 years. So I guess the question is, would $2,000 be worth the risk of switching to a private loan from federal.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**: A bayesian neural network trained to recognize handwritten digits from MNIST whose parameters are inferred via variational inference techniques. The main advantage of using bayesian techniques in neural networks is that you can sample outputs and infer a distribution using which you can deduce confidence / certainty of the output. I used the inferred network to recognize images that are not like MNIST digits.

&amp;#x200B;

[Sample evaluation on MNIST dataset \(with histogram of log-probabilities \~100 samples\)](https://i.redd.it/jmkd6u1ae2121.png)

**The accuracy on MNIST dataset on test set was 96%** (it skipped about 12% of hard to recognize images). When I fed it randomly generated images, the network refused to classify 95% of images and when I fed it alphabet looking images **(from not-MNIST dataset), it refused to classify \~80% of images.** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Sample evaluation on not-MNIST dataset \(with histogram of log-probabilities \~100 samples\)](https://i.redd.it/0d1lwxrde2121.png)

This approach can be applied to other networks such as financial prediction networks where if conditions change, you want your network to stop predicting rather than making wrong predictions.

CryptoCurrency,Start identifying smart money and follow the whales (long post),"**TL;DR** We’ve made [Coindraft](http://coindraft.io/), a tool to help you as an investor identify hidden risks behind coins, when it’s a good idea to enter/exit the markets and which coins are most likely to explode in price. We explain whats behind below.

It’s not a “magic wand”, but a starting point to understand what's behind each coin. And maybe help discover crypto gems to invest for the next bull run.

&amp;#x200B;

Why? Because we want to make crypto-investing more transparent and easier to understand. And we’ve been working on it these last months and would love your feedback, newbie and veteran. Hopefully can also be useful to you as an investor. You can also just visit the [tool](http://coindraft.io/) and have a look beforehand.

&amp;#x200B;

*We’re only interested in critique from you fellow crypto degens.* *No ICO, money-asking or clickbait articles.*  


# What the fuck have I done?

&amp;#x200B;

Like us, you’re probably looking at a lot of red numbers in this bear market. And it's causing many of us to reflect what could have been done better (***WHAT THE FUCK HAVE I DONE?!*** is another way you could say this).

&amp;#x200B;

Crypto is really, really hard to understand. It combines many heavy domains (finance, cryptography, network security, monetary policy, markets, game theory, psychology etc)... And because of this, doing proper research into coins is difficult and time-consuming. With so much money at stake, information is often weaponized into false narratives, FUD and emotional bias.

&amp;#x200B;

There’s a lot of information out there, but what matters and what to do is **not clear**. This leads to investing in coins with huge hidden risks. Which is exactly what we did. Our first entry in crypto was essentially *Pay n' Spray* and hope for glory. Instead, we became 'members of the community' aka *hodlers*. How could we have seen this coming? Spotted the scam coins and stop making stupid decisions? *Holding losing bags sucks.*

&amp;#x200B;

We KNOW crypto represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to grasp with every limb, but we need to get smarter.

# 

# So now what? Follow the smart money

The main driver behind Coindraft comes from the mindset that everything is your fault as a trader. Obviously, there are many things outside of your control, but if you approach your profession with this mentality, you can attempt to **quantify and mitigate all risks** that you do control. This data wants to help you do exactly that.

 

**We see that for every coin, there are large ‘market movers’ —** players who move markets through large capital investments. These movements can be outside of your control but WILL impact your portfolio. They are often hard to spot but do leave trails that can be extremely informative and valuable to investors of any size. We got into more detail in a blog post [here](https://medium.com/@coindraft/picking-shitcoins-101-f66282927fc9).

&amp;#x200B;

We call this **‘Whale Watching’**. It works by seeing whether they're:

1. Buying  
 
2. Mining  
 
3. Staking  
 
4. Selling off their bags  
 
5. Doing nothing.  


Through a series of costly \*invest...\*experiments ahem, **we identified which parameters are most important for a coin to explode in price**, and built this information into a spreadsheet that became invaluable in helping pick ‘winning’ shitcoins.

&amp;#x200B;

**When we know this, we have a small set of coins which we can study in greater detail.** It saves a lot of time.

&amp;#x200B;

The two most critical parameters to how a coin can explode in price are **Coin supply** (Circulating, total and max supply), and **Block structure** for PoW coins / **Emission schedule** for PoS coins. Also important to consider is the existence of a **Premine** and its size if there is one. To look at this, we are going to cover:

1. Supply Assessment  
 
2. Emission and Inflation estimates  
 
3. Wealth distribution analytics

&amp;#x200B;

With this data, we can identify **which coins** are most likely to be used by Whales. And with the wealth distribution tool, we can learn **when to buy and sell** (a next feature in the roadmap).

&amp;#x200B;

# Total Supply in Circulation

This is defined as the total amount currently in existence.

A difference between Circulating and Total Supply can indicate that the developers are **holding amounts of coins privately**. What has happened in the past, and will happen again is sudden large drops of coins occur which DUMPS the price on you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Big players don’t like this threat (And neither should you).**

&amp;#x200B;

Some coins have legitimate drops which won’t affect price as they are pre-announced and smaller in size - but this requires you to put in the research. You want coins which have at least ⅔ of total supply in circulation that can be bought and sold by market participants at will.

&amp;#x200B;

# Max Supply in Circulation

Circulating Supply greater than 70% of max supply is optimal. The maximum supply is the max amount of coins that can ever be produced/released. It will tell you whether a coin is going to suffer from large levels of inflationary pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

*Ex: Coin X (CX) has had 100 000 coins come into existence since it was launched a week ago. Currently trading at 0.0001 BTC per CX, giving it a market cap of 10 BTC. At this small of a market cap, you can only imagine it will rocket. But hold on - let’s check the max supply: 1bn coins. This would put CX at a max market cap of 100.000 BTC. That puts it within the top 30 coins. This is a highly devaluatory metric. Because you need to bet that the demand will continue to grow equal to the growth of supply.*

&amp;#x200B;

In simple terms - if the deflationary pressure is at 20%, you will need an equal increase in demand to just keep the coin relatively stable in price = That’s just a huge risk which is best avoided. To find the genuine exceptions, we need to understand how the block rewards are designed for this specific coin = Much more research.

&amp;#x200B;

# Block structure (PoW)

With the block time and block reward, we can roughly calculate the coin supply at any given moment in the future, and work out the rate of inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

# Emission design (PoS)

When we know the parameters of the emission schedule we can roughly calculate coin supply at any moment in the future, and work out the rate of inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

# Inflation Rate

Imagine you have a glass of wine and someone decides to pour some water into your glass. You’ll have more ‘wine’, but it will be weaker per unit.

&amp;#x200B;

Through analyzing the block structure or emission design of any coin, we can roughly work out its rate of inflation. If a coin suffers from high inflation it tells you that there will be a large future supply entering the market, resulting in each existing unit drop in value.

&amp;#x200B;

# Premine

This is when the team behind a coin reserves a specific amount of coins for themselves. If this is less than 2%, it’s usually for engineering, marketing, and business development. If it’s greater than 2% it’s almost always for *“engineering”, “Marketing”, “business development” and “charity”.* And you can expect future sudden supply dumps.

&amp;#x200B;

The closer to 0% premine is optimal. There are exceptions to the rule, but in general, it is advised to place skepticism towards projects that have a premine higher than 2%.

&amp;#x200B;

When we process this data according to the above metrics, we should, in theory, **have a smaller basket of coins that are of high interest to whales.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Coindraft

We made [http://coindraft.io](http://coindraft.io/) because we want to give transparency to the above, and make the crypto space more accessible to people that might be struggling as bad as us. At the least, we can learn a few things.

Any feedback, good or bad, would be super helpful. We want to continue building on this, and it would be great to know what you find valuable or not.

1. This is built by regular hoomans. Expect bugs. Let us know of anything weird and we'll do our best to fix them!  
 
2. This is early stuff. We want to arrange available information in a more useful way. For now, consider us as an attempt to be a bit more sophisticated version of coinmarketcap.  
 
3. We got lots of seriously cool stuff coming up as well. But we could use your direction. These are:

&amp;#x200B;

**Whale Watching**

Seeing the concentration of wealth and comparing with different coins is really valuable.

  
We have been recording the whales for some time now and we are soon about to launch a set of tools that lets you analyze the richest holders and their activity. Are they suddenly sending a lot of coins to exchanges? Accumulating coins at low prices? Soon you’ll be able to see all of this. This is the exciting stuff. For some reason, most traders don’t take advantage of this information (but it works great).

 

**Sentiment Analysis**

Tracking coin 'chatter' on social media can help make irrational markets a little bit less irrational. You'll be able to see how **volume** and **social mentions** evolve together with price. And where it may be going. E.g., it's normal to see a spike in social media before big price moves.

 

**Recommendation &amp; Signal Notifications**

We finally want to add a recommendation &amp; notification when data changes occur — in particular about large supply movements.

All loans are federal. We applied and were approved for REPAYE to help with interest for unsubsidized loans. Our payment of $200 would be less than accrued interest. Hopeful to gain second employment soon. 

Before first payment was due, fedloan put loans into forbearance without our input. Payments are now $0. What can be done about this? Is this blessing or curse? We applied to be on REPAYE again. Does this trigger interest capitalization? 

We have large amount of savings parents and friends gave to us towards buying a house. Upon reading people’s advice in this sub, we decided that buying a house does not make sense now. Do you agree? 

After 6 months of emergency funds, we have about 17k to pay down loan instead of down payment. Can we pay loan while on forbearance? 

There are significant amount of accrued interest (approximately 3k) on different groups of loans. Does it make sense to first pay off completely certain loan groups or should I first apply payments to outstanding interest so that they don’t capitalize when payment plan changes? In other words, ignore accrued interest for some loans and aggressively pay down principal towards higher interest rate unsubsidized loans? Thanks for your help.",finance
investing,Fed warns that a ‘particularly large’ plunge in market prices is possible if risks materialize,"&gt; “An escalation in trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainty, or other adverse shocks could lead to a decline in investor appetite for risks in general,” the report said. “The resulting drop in asset prices might be particularly large, given that valuations appear elevated relative to historical levels.”

&gt; “High leverage has historically been linked to elevated financial distress and retrenchment by businesses in economic downturns” 

&gt; “Given the valuation pressures associated with business debt ... such an increase in financial distress, should it transpire, could trigger a broad adjustment in prices of business debt.”

stocks,Profit growth over the last 10 years in the tech sector,"Graph of this issue:
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DtFqnAZXcAAV0ck.jpg

Amid the incessant geopolitical tumult coming out of Washington and elsewhere, tech stocks have served as an island to which investors have been able to retreat and earn outsized returns.

In fact, there's an argument to be made that the sector actually has benefited from some of the more prominent headline risks. Tech stands to gain perhaps more than any other sector if President Donald Trump's saber-rattling trade strategy works out, and the administration-backed tax cuts have put more money in shareholders' pockets through a history-making jump in share buybacks that have been skewed toward the sector.

All in all, tech has served a multitude of purposes, from a cyclical play amid economic growth and rising interest rates, and as pure quality amid fears that corporate profits are peaking.

""They're really not driven by a lot of these headline macro variables. They've also stayed out of the Washington limelight in terms of being part of a tweetstorm or what have you,"" said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. ""They're going to be more heavily driven by fundamentals, which continue to be supportive.

Do you think the tech sector will continue to perform like in the shown graph?

personalfinance,How do I negotiate salary with a a federal government position?,"This past summer I interned with the DoD, and upon completion of the internship, our class of interns received job offers for after graduation. I've recently received the salary, and while it's above starting pay for the position, it's not only less than I anticipated, but less than some of my peers have received. While my GPA is lower than others, I have two majors, two minors, and a certificate. I also speak a foreign language (proficiently but not fluently, will likely be at Intermediate-High level at graduation) and was the only intern with military service.

I would not have received a job offer if my background was of some value to the agency. To have been extended an offer on its own is extraordinary, but I can't help but feel I'm worth more. I had to reach out to get salary figures and provided a preliminary list of skills along with an updated CV, but I don't feel as if either of these properly accentuated what I bring to the table. How should I go about countering the offered salary figure?

What do I need to do to protect myself and my investment?","We're in a committed relationship and have had the marriage talks, and are certainly getting married in the future. We are not yet  engaged. The loan is going to be in his name only, as he has better credit than I do. We're first time home buyers and doing a conventional loan through his bank. I'm the financial breadwinner in our family, so I'll be contributing the majority of our down payment, and sharing the cost of the mortgage and living expenses.

Since we're not married, I understand that I have no legal interest in the dwelling. How do I best keep track of my contributions and protect myself in case something bad happens? Is it possible for my name to be on the deed/title to the home but not on the loan? 

Thanks in advance for any advice. We're officially under contract as of this morning. Any additional advice or recommendations on the home buying process, not relevant to my initial question about my finances are also welcome. I have read over a lot of the info available in the sidebar/wiki. :)

Edit: Thank you to everyone who has replied so far. I am just getting around to lunch at work, so I am limited on time at the moment. I see a lot of responses that say ""get married"". This is bordering on relationship advice, but how should I suggest to him we should suddenly get married without it sounding like an ultimatum?

Alternatively to getting married, if I am added as a co-signer on his loan, that then gives me legal and financial interest in the property then, correct? We'd both be building equity together? My credit isn't awful (about 700), but his is better (closer to 800). If I were added to the loan as a cosigner, how much of an impact could it potentially have with our interest rate?

We started our house hunt a few months ago with my pre-approval of an FHA loan on my own without him, but switched because he could get a conventional loan. Is it too late to switch out the financing now that we're under contract, and add him to my FHA loan since it's not credit based? Or is a conventional loan always going to be better than an FHA loan?

I'm a student currently taking a double degree in Banking and Finance. I started Forex a year before starting my double degree and I've always aspired to work in a career relating to Forex or just trading as a whole. I love analyzing charts and predicting movements, but that is as far as i can go. I'm really dying to learn Forex fundamentally on a more intricate level and along with that mindset, a career in Forex or trading in the future. I love the thought of being able to understand how everything links together and how news releases, speeches, interest rates etc causes movements. However, me being the dumbass i am. Decided blindly that a degree in Banking (aspiring to be a trader in a bank) and Finance (just cause its Forex) is the way to go. I understand that Economics is vital and crucial in the Fundamental aspects of Forex and i guess i didnt do enough research and overlooked the fact that a degree in Economics is available as well.  


So here i am, kinda screwed. I'm just really clueless and overwhelmed as a career as a 'trader' is so broad. Hedge fund traders, prop traders, investment banking etc. I don't really know what my ideal career is per se, as all i wanna do is understand fundamentals, analyze charts and predict.   


I'm also really confused and lost as to whether or not Banking and Finance is the right choice. Hell, is a Degree in Banking even a right choice? IF it is, should i change to Banking and Economics??

My expenses are little, I still live at home and pay $500 in rent and about $600 for all other expenses (car insurance, food, tithe , petty savings, subscriptions etc) so this plan is doable. I also have 1k in emergency funds and automatically save $65 each paycheck. I also contribute 5% to 401k

This plan looks good on paper but it's getting hard. I don't have a problem with being frugal, it actually matches my personality, things don't make me happy.

The only issues is that my family constantly mock me for being frugal and I've already had issues with my mum and sister expecting more financial help from me and me saying no. This is more of a relationship problem but it hurts that they think I'm selfish. 

I'm also scared that I'm not able to save more and stockpile money, although my expenses are low, I just feel like I should be saving more, especially since my monthly payments are low, the interest rate is low and I don't have any other debts. I could have so much more money saved up.

39 married one kid
Dual income $150k plus 
Both work for the government so our jobs are rock solid. 
Only debt is cars at less and 1% interest and a mortgage. 
Max contributions to retirement and HSA. 
I have about $30k at Vanguard  70/30 stock to bonds split.  VTSAX/VWITX
$10k in Vanguard federal money market fund (emergencies) 
I have about $70k in available credit from my bank at under 10% apr. 
We have excellent health, dental, and life insurance. 

So with that being said I cant really come up with a lot of emergencies that require me to need $10k in instant cash. Medical bills would never be $10k even with the most extremes of life or at least not at once. 
My cars are fully insured and we have hundreds of hours of sick and paid time off available for us just Incase if accidents or illnesses. 

With the available credit and stability of life and jobs is there anything negative in me investing the $10k back into the 70/30 ETF?  I can always sell my funds without any large penalties as they are not IRA”s?

Now, the subsidized loans do not accrue interest (that I pay) until six months after that (grace period) - February 2019.

So essentially, I should not begin paying down this debt until ... when, exactly? Average interest rate is 4.17%, and the overall level of debt is around $13k.

With my position I am beginning in 2019, I could probably pay this down within 12-18 months, starting in January, but I'd like to hear some perspective. Pay it down faster, or take advantage of grace period and pay it off more slowly/wait to begin making payments, assuming a better return elsewhere? Where would this ""elsewhere"" be, do you think?

Would it be better to work on paying the car loan off early? Or should I dump the money into the larger student loan and keep the car loan open longer? Or will it not matter? Currently I pay the same minimum payment on each, so that isn't a factor either. I'm at 680 so I'm not too concerned but I would like to do what I can to get above 700 if possible before I apply for a credit card.",finance

personalfinance,The housing market is starting to crater. Buy now or wait for lower prices with higher interest?,"Now I know there are no perfect predictions, but many sources I've read over the last several weeks are expecting interest rates to rise (approx. 1% give or take some) over the next 15 months for mortgages, which will slow down and already slowing down home buying market.

If the market craters and you start getting homes for cheaper, but a the cost of higher interest, could this be a good thing in order to get into the market?  Again, I know there are no good answers because of imperfect information, but is there a general consensus on how much you'd need to get off on a home prices tag to make you get out ahead with a higher mortgage interest rate?

gaming,Has Bethesda denied your refund request? Heres how to get your money back.,"**Fair Warning: This will most likely get your account banned from their launcher/site. However you will get your money back.**

&amp;#x200B;

If you like most people play on PC (This should also work just as well for consoles) and have requested a refund only to have your request denied, let me introduce you to consumer protection and chargebacks. These are protections going back to the 1970's in the US that protect consumers when a merchant is unwilling to issue a refund that is for a proper reason.

&gt;Not as Described or Defective Merchandise.  
&gt;  
&gt;Significantly Not As Described.

All credit card issuers by federal law must accept a complaint/chargeback request within 60 days however Visa &amp; Mastercard allow 120 days from the day of purchase to initiate a dispute with a transaction. If you have used your debit card you have even longer protections by federal law, 180 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Most all issuers of your card will require some form of communication with the merchant (Bethesda) so open a support ticket/email and ask for a refund on the basis the game is not as described, unplayable at launch with bugs etc. Save their response and be prepared to show your issuer this denial. Once you have done this call your bank if you've used your issued debit/credit card or direct credit card issuer. Numbers listed below.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Visa:**  **1-800-847-2911**  
&gt;  
&gt;**MasterCard:**  **1-800-307-7309**  
&gt;  
&gt;**American Express:   1-800-528-4800**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Discover:  1-800-347-2683**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Or simply dial the 1-800 on the back of your card.**

&amp;#x200B;

You are LEGALLY PROTECTED to have the product you have purchased be AS DESCRIBED and WORK PROPERLY in the US. There are current lawsuits being looked into against Bethesda for deceptive practices and refusing to issue refunds. You will win the chargeback and get your money back. Do not let a company get away with this, not only will you get your money back but each chargeback costs the company between $20-$100 in fees as laid out in their agreements with credit card issuers when they lose a disputed chargeback.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: There has been a huge number of comments and even a temporary removal of the post about using chargebacks. 

Let me be very clear, this is NOT some sort of magical process to get your money back on everything you are 'disappointed' with.

Use chargebacks ONLY for legitimate reasons and make sure you are in the right. Using this as a way to just get your money back on things you shouldn't WILL land you in trouble with your bank, credit issuer and possible fraud charges.

Chargebacks are a last resort when a seller or merchant is in the wrong. These are tracked and checked by the banks every single time you do this.",technology

gaming,I'm waiting for the day that MMOs actually fully embrace griefing the way they REALLY should.,"I want a game where your karma is tracked, and once your negative karma has reached a certain point you're not allowed to do anything in game until you participate - and complete - an event.  In this event you're paired up with player of a lower level than you.  You have to run that other player through a gauntlet, down a long valley, with the following stipulations:

* All other players in the game with positive karma are allowed to line up on either side of this valley, and they get to try to stop you.    
* You will take all the damage thrown at you by every other player who wants to, you cannot fight back, and you cannot heal.    
* Debating whether or not the escort will take any damage, if they do then you have to heal them, if they die you fail.    
* For every two points of damage you take one point of your karma changes into a gold coin for the low level player you're escorting.    
* You are only absolved of that portion of your karmic debt if you make it successfully to the end of the valley.    
* If you die, you have to start over.  The lower level character keeps all the gold but your karma reverts back to where it was before the run.    
* You must do as many successful runs as you need to reduce your karma back to zero/neutral.

I see multiple good reasons for this:

* Only absolving one karma point per two points DMG taken means you're literally making it twice as hard to burn off your karma than accumulate it.  This could be changed to 3 or 4 if deemed necessary.    
* This is compounded by the fact you must survive a gauntlet run for those karma points to be converted, so if positive karma players can kill you before you can complete your run then you could be paying a lot more than double to pay it off.    
* It helps lower level players.
* It FORCES douchebags to help lower level players - probably the exact same ones they were griefing.    
* It forces the griefer to want their escort to stay alive.    
* It might actually create a situation where a griefer either befriends the player they're escorting, or at the very least makes that player's name give them a bad taste in their mouth that they might think about whenever they see that player in game again, hopefully dissuading them griefing them.

And if that doesn't stop them from griefing, so what?  Who cares?  Anyone being griefed will know that they'll be rewarded in the end.  That could take away the sting of having been griefed (and, for some strange people, actually make them enjoy it).

Up for debate: how to implement the assigning of karma.  I think it's obvious that karma could/should be assigned automatically for certain things (player killing, shoving someone off a dock while fishing...).  Kill stealing could, but that may/may not be able to be done automatically, depends on other game mechanics.  Maybe you could click on someone and have a report option, with drop down menus about the event, and that event could dictate the penalty karmic amount.  There would have to be some mechanism to combat abuse of the reporting system.

Anyway, hopefully some of you current/future game designers will think about this and implement it.

deeplearning,"Help with Bias, Weights and Pooling Layer in DCNN","[Posted this in r/machinelearning already, but maybe its more fitting here]

Hey Guys 

I am doing a little project for university about deep learning, this includes a theoretical part. 

I am sitting here for a couple of hours (and days to be honest) trying to understand what weights, biases and the pooling layer in a DCNN are. 

So this is what I understood so far:

Weights and Bias

Weights are a binary number that are determined by a neuronal network and basically says how important the output of a neuron is for the calculation of the next neuron. So the importance of a output. 

The Bias is also a number determined by the NN and is basically a threshold that determines if the incoming output of the previous neuron is ""important/high"" enough to activate the neuron. 

The actual output of the activation function of a neuron, the weight and bias are processed by the sigmoid function and gives a value that is given to the next neuron.

The determination of weights and biases in a NN is optimized through gradient descent (or was it back propagation?). 


Pooling and Kernels 


The Kernels in a DCNN ""scan"" the whole picture small area by small area and then gives it to the Pooling Neurons. The pooling Neurons then proceed to check the scanned small areas for features that determine what kind of picture was fed to the DCNN. What I dont understand is why there are multiple pooling layers and what the pooling layers send to the Neurons in the hidden layers. 

Sorry if my understanding is laughable and my questions are dumb, but I just cant wrap my head around this. 

Every help is appreciated!

Thanks!",technology

I'd just like to hear your thoughts on what I should expect if I were to pull the trigger on a new vehicle as my lifestyle has changed and can afford to purchase something more of my style.

I have a car worth (via KBB) as $18,000 as a trade in. I bought it in July 2016 with a 60 month payment with a 1.8% interest rate @ $297/month. I owe just over $9,000 on the vehicle.

If I were to trade in this car for another vehicle, would my interest rate go up, or would it typically go up since I'm trading in a vehicle for a new one before I pay it off? Or since my credit score has gone up even more since I've purchased my vehicle, would it possibly remain the same?

The car I'm looking at would be about double the cost of my current vehicle. However if I were to have my same interest rate (and given I would start again at 60 months) my per month cost would be approx $100-$200 more  which is more than doable at my current time.

economy,The ambiguity in Powell's words has triggered the Dollar to plummet,"The dollar was significantly affected by the words of the Fed Chairman on Wednesday. The dollar index has dropped by 0.9%, in response to Powell's comments that the Federal funds rate is “just below” the neutral level. These words were perceived as dovish compared to what the Fed Chairman commented in early October.

The weakening of the US Dollar is favorable for the stock market. The dollar’s decrease and the expectations of a softer approach from the Fed, have triggered a 2.3%-2.5% increase in key U.S. indices. 

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier in October, Powell had warned the market that the Fed could raise the rates above the neutral level, which would push stock indices lower, increase demand for the dollar and trigger a sharp decline for Crude Oil. The shift of the Central Bank’s stance has caused the dollar to plummet overnight, and it might as well have a serious impact on the future prospects of the dollar, initiating a prolonged decline.

In the recent weeks, the Fed had given a few signals about a change in their sentiment and FOMC talks more about 2-3 rate increases in 2019, compared to 4 in 2018. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, what’s more important, is how the markets will perceive this message, rather than the message itself. In October, market participants perceived the tone of Powell as too hawkish.

The same goes for yesterday's comments as well. It was stated that the current rate of 2.00%-2.25% is barely lower than the neutral level, which is defined as a range of 2.5%-3.5%. Nevertheless, it is only a new fact, and does not in any case cancels out the comments made in October that the rate during the current policy tightening may go above the neutral level.

Most likely, the markets saw what they wanted to see, and they have started selling the dollar from its local highs. The market's turbulent reaction to the news, has triggered the dollar to approach the end of its growth trend. The USDX’s drop below 96.50 can definitively mark the beginning of a downward reversal. This is also confirmed by technical analysis, in which we highlighted the divergence between the price chart and the technical indicator RSI.

&amp;#x200B;

It has also already been noted, that the EURUSD and the GBPUSD may have instigated a reversal. The downward trend of the euro has slowed down, and the EURUSD pair is out of the downward channel. The British pound receives support from buyers on the dips, in the area of 1.27 dollar.

Mr. Powell talked about the range of estimates of the neutral level when he said interest rates are just below the neutral level, Mr. Marey says. The range is of between 2.5% and 3.5%, so we are ""only one or two hikes away from the broad range of estimates of that level,"" Mr. Marey says. However, compared with the median estimate of a neutral level, which is of 3%, ""we are three to four hikes away from neutral,"" says Mr. Marey.

personalfinance,High Yield Savings accounts: PNC Bank,"My search for a higher interest rate led my to PNC Bank online, which offered a 2.35% rate.  Not bad I thought, so I jumped in with both feet.  When I tried to initiate a second transfer of $ into the account I was blocked.  Apparently I had reached my transfer limit for a rolling 30-day period.  In addition, I was blocked from moving any $ out as well.  When the 30-day period is over I am going to begin moving it all out of this bank.  But that will take me four months to accomplish, since PNC's max transfer to external bank accounts is limited to a much smaller amount than their limit for deposits.  I've had many online accounts in the past and find this very unusual.  It's a good rate - but if you want easy access to your $ at this bank I advise you keep your balance  low enough so that you can withdraw it in one transfer.

personalfinance,Incentive for paying off student loans with an income driven repayment plan?,"I have about 10 loans equalling 37k in student loans floating around 5% through navient that I have been in an income driven repayment plan for about 5 years now. When I asked about consolidating/refinancing for a lower interest rate the service rep said that if I did I would lose the time spent on the income driven repayment towards forgiveness, which I was unaware of. She said that after making payments with the income driven repayment plan, whatever is leftover will be forgiven. My income has gone from 40k to 57k since I started making payments and I have no issues paying the requested amount each month. My question is what is my incentive to put more towards them each month if the cost isn't so bad and whatever remains will be forgiven in 20 years?

Recently, I've been considering refinancing my loans for a lower rate. I've been doing a lot of online research and checking out options on websites like NerdWallet, but it's obviously a big decision so I'm naturally a little hesitant. Would it be worth it to refinance for a lower rate (and potentially higher monthly payment)? If my income is lower in a year, could a fixed rate/monthly payment be risky compared to an income-based repayment plan? If I refinance, can I combine Firstmark and MyFedLoan into one total loan and pay it all through the same financier?  Any advice is greatly appreciated!",finance

CryptoCurrency,The way blockchain could fix mainstream game monetization?,"Hello! I’m Gameunculus Community manager, and we recently published this article for mainstream gamers that are interested in crypto games and the blockchain.

One of the main problems with AAA game developers is that lately their monetization practices have been questionable at best, which has gamers at the end of their rope. This could potentially sway gamers that are fed up from the mainstream platforms into looking for alternative ones, much like it happened with Indie gaming. Let’s see how crypto gaming could deal with monetization in a potentially much better way.

**Monetization on mainstream games**

When did the monetization craze start? Well, monetization has always been there. From physical merchandise and pre-order bonuses to the digital exclusive pre-order bonuses of today, to the amount of downloadable content that is offered and the microtransaction frenzy of the last couple of years, monetization is everywhere.

**Infamous cases of microtransactions**

Almost every AAA videogame joins in on the fun of charging extra for in-game assets, but there are certain companies that take it to another level. The interactive football game mode FIFA Ultimate Team became incredibly successful more than five years ago, but it’s getting harder to keep their audience engaged year after year, and Star Wars: Battlefront II was one of the most infamous releases lately, with evident paywalls. These are just the tip of the iceberg, but are two well-renown cases.

**How could blockhain fix this?**

The main principle behind crypto gaming is the decentralization of in-game assets, and this could be effectively applied to mainstream gaming. There are multiple ways in which blockchain gaming can help in tackling these issues.

Blockchain games are still extremely new compared to the mainstream industry, but it’s only a matter of time until these two realities clash head to head.

personalfinance,"Payoff debt, invest, store cash - What should we do?","I'd love some advice from the community.  My wife and I have a decent amount of cash saved, and we're wondering if we should (1) pay off certain debts, (2) invest in the market, or (3) keep our cash.  

1. Pay off certain debts - We think we'd like to pay off my wife's student loans since it's the highest interest rate and we make too much to deduct the interest on our taxes.  I'm less inclined to pay off the cars.
2. Invest in the market - I think we make too much to get a deduction from an IRA contributions, so it might not be worth it.  Our current 401K contributions are 8% (6% fully matched) and 5% (2% fully matched) of our salaries.  There's room to withhold more at the end of the year without going over the annual max.  
3. Keep our cash - We would like to buy a home at some point in the next few years and want to have a 20% down payment.  I'm also very weary of the market (both home market and equity markets) right now.  I don't want to be caught in a big downturn.

Here's our situation:

* Cash in HY Savings @ 2.05% of $140K; another \~$15K in Jan/Feb from annual bonus
* Car debt is $28k and includes two car loans at around 3%
* Student loan debt is \~ $10K at somewhere around 6%-6.5%
* 401K - \~$40K combined between my wife and me
* We make combined $300k annually
* Having our first child in the coming months, so looking to start a WA state 529 plan

We would like to purchase a home in the coming years, but have intentionally held out to see if prices in Seattle subside.  When we do purchase a home, it'll likely be around $800K.

personalfinance,New Federal Reserve study: consumer preferences are similar across generations,"There is a new study published by the Federal Reserve about the consumer spending habits of millennials (people born between 1981 and 1997) that I think will be interesting to people on pf.

The study found that there is not much difference in consumer preference between millenials and previous generations (comparison with data from gen-x and boomers). Unlike gen-x, which spent more than boombers age and CPI-adjusted, millenials spend on par with gen-x. The study associates the lack of increase in spending with the 2008 recession, which came in early in millenials' careers, decreasing their ability to spend. In particular:

""It primarily is the differences in average age and then differences in average income that explain a large and important portion of the consumption wedge between millennials and other cohorts”

financialindependence,FIRE path from High School to Army/Air Force/Marines/Navy or coast Guard.,"Not sure if this is relevant but I imagine many of you have kids potentially thinking of serving. While the pay is not great, there are a lot of things not commonly known. I responded to another post with this only to find out the poster wasn't thinking of going into a U.S. branch of service. Not a great writer but here it is.

 \------------

There are camouflage million(s) that many who enlist after high school to serve never see because they don't think about it up front, you are doing that.

First of all if you join up and do 20 years you will have a pension for life (that starts the day you retire) and almost free healthcare (its totally free while serving). Assuming you only make it to E7 (versus E8 or E9) you will walk away getting (in today's dollars) 40% of $5,237.41 so roughly 2000 bucks a month for life indexed to inflation. Take that grand and assume 25% in taxes (it is taxed federally and potentially by the state depending on your state) and its 1500 bucks a month or 18 grand a year after taxes. Now lets factor in health care. I am retired and pay $600 a year (wife and I) for health care and it is great healthcare (we use doctors we choose). I'm not sure what others that are not on tricare (military healthcare) pay but i imagine its near 10 times that amount. I'm not up on how much 401k (TSP in military speak but its a 401K) matching the military does now (its new and also why you get 40% now versus 50% of your pay at retirement). But up front if you did 10% of your income and then put half of your annual raises I think you could conservatively amass over 500 grand. Speaking of raise, you get them often and they are not performance based, they are based on time. Every year I got a cost of living raise, my first 5 years i also got an annual raise (after that it was every 2 years), plus you get raises when you get promoted and you will (assuming you don't get in trouble) get promoted, those are set periodically too. And as mentioned the pay isn't great (at first, its competitive after 5 years) so you likely would amass all of that in a Roth 401K so tax free withdrawals. Now with all that said you are 37 or 38 years old when all this goes down. A pension of 18 grand a year (today's dollars), healthcare for life for \~600 bucks a year and a half million in a tax free account. Now at that young age you do what you want to. Add in the fact that most enlisted service members get ""at least"" a bachelors degree for free while serving. I would say that pension package, health care and 401K is worth more than a million dollars and your under 40 years old and in great shape.

The pay is better than most think. what they see in the military pay tables is based on one living in the barracks free and using the army dining halls (also free meals). If you live off post you get a tax free housing allowance based on the location and you get a stipend for not using the dining halls (you still can but would pay for each meal).

Let's also talk your health. while you are serving you will stay in good shape, you will go to the doctor for checkups periodically and you will see the dentist periodically, all free. so when/if you do retire or get out, your in good health. Many by the age of 37-38 are already in less than average health condition, you won't be.

My advice to you is to talk to all of the services (Army, Navy, Marines, Air force and coast Guard) about the opportunities they have. Please do this you never know what they will offer (sometimes bonuses for enlisting). It's fine to want to be one of the elite marines but if your potentially going to make the military a career you may want to go into a specialty that translates to the civilian world. You still will be doing all of the basic war fighter skills, but will learn a craft that pays $$$ when you depart. For example cyber warfare, supply/logistics, aircraft mechanic, load master for cargo planes, communications etc. All of those specialties are in high demand once you depart. We need young men and women to get into the ""lets be on the front lines"" for our country but that skill set (other than leadership) doesn't translate the best when you get out (especially if you do not do the whole 20 years and leave only with your 401K).

Typed this fast but feel free to be in touch. And after all that typing I see your in England i think and i have no clue how there system works but have served with many brits and they are fine war fighters.

personalfinance,"Making money for the first time, have 45k in student loans.","I'm struggling with what to do with my student loans.

CryptoCurrency,A reminder on why cryptocurrency was invented in the first place.,"I've taken this from a post I've saved a while ago and I usually come back to it to remind myself on the significance of cryptocurrency and why it's here to stay. I would post the link but for some reason it wouldn't let me. 

&amp;#x200B;

* People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.
* Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.
* Banks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks collapsed because of runs on the bank.
* Central banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort. Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered. Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all, banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.
* Banks would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments would have to step in to save them.
* All ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create.
* From this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make.
* This led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in the supply of the euro of about 5%.
* This leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.
* What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
* Banks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at an interest.
* Apart from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or the system will collapse.
* Apart from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.
* The absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and silver remain difficult to use.
* When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of failure.
* What was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial system.

So, if you find yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price, or bogged down in discussions about the “one true bitcoin”, or constantly asking what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

We are here to fix the financial system.",cryptocurrency
investing,Why do I want my IRR to be greater than my Discount Rate?,"From what I understand, discount rate is essentially the interest rate that you would need to pay on a loan, or to determine present value of future cash flows. It seems similar to IRR in that a bank would only offer you a discount rate that will make the future money they pay you equal to a present value of $0. But the Discount Rate makes the NPV = $0. So why should the IRR be higher than the discount rate, wouldn't you want a rate that gets you to $0.00 faster than your discount rate. Maybe I'm not making sense here, lol I'm new to these concepts. Thank you!

**edit: for example if you have a discount rate of 5% wouldn't you get a value of $0 faster than an IRR of 9% and thus make more money sooner? I get that for some reason you want the gap between the 2 to be higher, but I'm not really sure why you would make more money that way.**",finance
personalfinance,"Today i refinanced my car, and i had some questions regarding the results.","So today i refinanced my vehicle. My previous payoff quote was 7,430 dollars and i had 59 months left on the term ( i know it's awful, but i had a 400 credit score and had a 23% interest rate). My credit is doing much better now at 620 and i looked into refinancing my car. I found an offer that put my interest rate for a 60 month loan at 12.3%. I took it as it's about as much time as i have left now, but with almost have the interest rate. Total it looks like i'm saving about 3300 dollars on interest which is great.  

However, i saw that on the contract there was a 2300 dollar ""finance charge"" which brought my total amount loaned to 7400 dollars, just as it had been before. I figured it would be a lot less to pay off, since the interest rate had dropped and the term stayed about the same (my monthly payment did drop from 225-165, however). 

I have about 4000 dollars banked right now in my savings account with no purpose (I was using it as an emergency fund, but i've since built one to about 2800 which is about 3 months of bills). Should i use this 4000 to throw at the new loan? I'm not sure how much it'll increase the payoff rate and am worried the results will be underwhelming.  

I was expecting to have my payoff quote go from 7400 to about 4100 since i'd be saving about 3000 on interest, but i was mistaken because of the finance charge, i guess.",finance
personalfinance,Credit builder card?,"I don't use and never needed a credit card (I save a lot, and never spend more than I have), but right now I'm needing to build credit (since I have none). A credit builder card seems to be the best option.

What would be the simplest and most straightforward option for me (UK)? I really don't want to waste time comparing interest rates/limits/etc. Just getting this card to build credit. I'd just use it a few times a month and always pay it off in full. Does it really make a difference which I pick?

I have had a Roth 401k for 5+ years now and was thinking about taking out a withdrawal to pay long standing credit balances down. I am still currently employed so pretty sure I don't qualify for any hardship exceptions. From what I found on the web it looks like the IRS would take a significant amount from the withdrawal something like 35%?! Seems crazy to me and then there is a potential 10% early withdraw fee as well? I don't get that because the Roth is after tax dollars so I already paid tax on it, right? From talking with other people they say taking a loan from it might be a better option but I really would just love to take the money out and pay it off and not worry about it. I am not concerned about replacing the money as my career progresses and I continue to make more money. I think I am able to take a loan and not pay any interest rate if I have it take a direct deposit from my check to pay it back? I am sure most of you will say first thing is to get your spending under control and stop using your CC, which I have but it is still difficult to make significant payments to my CC's after all bills and everything is covered. In a perfect world I could take my money out (it is my money after all!!) after maybe a small 10% fee? and pay off my CC's and start fresh. Any thoughts or advice would be great, thanks!",finance

financialindependence,The Father of Index Funds Sounds a Warning on Index Funds,"TL/DR: Due to the significant growth of index fund use, voting rights and control of public companies are held by an ever shrinking group of index fund managers (Vanguard, Blackrock, Fidelity, State Street)

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/bogle-sounds-a-warning-on-index-funds-1543504551](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bogle-sounds-a-warning-on-index-funds-1543504551)

There no longer can be any doubt that the creation of the first index mutual fund was the most successful innovation—especially for investors—in modern financial history. The question we need to ask ourselves now is: What happens if it becomes too successful for its own good?

The First Index Investment Trust, which tracks the returns of the S&amp;P 500 and is now known as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, was founded on December 31, 1975. It was the first “product,” as it were, of a new mutual fund manager, The Vanguard Group, the company I had founded only one year earlier.

The fund’s August 1976 initial public offering may have been the worst underwriting in Wall Street history. Despite the leadership of the Street’s four largest retail brokers, the IPO fell far short of its original $250 million target. The initial assets of 500 Index Fund totaled but $11.3 million—falling a mere 95% short of its goal.

The fund’s struggle for the attention (and dollars) of investors was epic. Known as “Bogle’s folly,” the fund’s novel strategy of simply tracking a broad market index was almost totally rejected by Wall Street. The head of Fidelity, then by far the fund industry’s largest firm, put the kiss of death on his tiny rival: “I can’t believe that the great mass of investors are \[sic\] going to be satisfied with just receiving average returns. The name of the game is to be the best.”

Almost a decade passed before a second S&amp;P 500 index fund was formed, by Wells Fargo in 1984. During that period, Vanguard’s index fund attracted cash inflow averaging only $16 million per year.

Now let’s advance the clock to 2018. What a difference 42 years makes! Equity index fund assets now total some $4.6 trillion, while total index fund assets have surpassed $6 trillion. Of this total, about 70% is invested in broad market index funds modeled on the original Vanguard fund.

Yes, U.S. index mutual funds have grown to huge size, with their holdings doubling from 4.5% of total U.S. stock-market value in 2002 to 9% in 2009, and then almost doubling again to more than 17% in 2018. Even that penetration understates the role of mutual fund managers, as they also offer actively managed funds, and their combined assets amount to more than 35% of the shares of U.S. corporations.

If historical trends continue, a handful of giant institutional investors will one day hold voting control of virtually every large U.S. corporation. Public policy cannot ignore this growing dominance, and consider its impact on the financial markets, corporate governance, and regulation. These will be major issues in the coming era.

Three index fund managers dominate the field with a collective 81% share of index fund assets: Vanguard has a 51% share; BlackRock, 21%; and State Street Global, 9%. Such domination exists primarily because the indexing field attracts few new major entrants.

Why? Partly because of two high barriers to entry: the huge scale enjoyed by the big indexers would be difficult to replicate by new entrants; and index fund prices (their expense ratios, or fees) have been driven to commodity-like levels, even to zero. If Fidelity’s 2018 offering of two zero-cost index funds has established a new “price point” for index funds, the enthusiasm of additional firms to create new index funds will diminish even further. So we can’t rely on new competitors to reduce today’s concentration.

Most observers expect that the share of corporate ownership by index funds will continue to grow over the next decade. It seems only a matter of time until index mutual funds cross the 50% mark. If that were to happen, the “Big Three” might own 30% or more of the U.S. stock market—effective control. I do not believe that such concentration would serve the national interest.

My concerns are shared by many academic observers. In a draft paper released in September, Prof. John C. Coates of Harvard Law School wrote that indexing is reshaping corporate governance, and warned that we are tipping toward a point where the voting power will be “controlled by a small number of individuals” who can exercise “practical power over the majority of U.S. public companies.” Professor Coates does not like what he sees, and offers tentative policy options—some necessary, often painful to contemplate. His conclusion—“The issue is not likely to go away”—is unarguable.

Solutions to resolve the issues connected with the concentration of corporate ownership are not self-evident, but a number of tentative possibilities have already been advanced:

• More competition from new entrants to the index field. For the reasons noted above, this eventuality seems highly unlikely.

• Force giant index funds to spin off their assets into a number of separate entities, each independently managed. Such a drastic step would—and should—face near-insurmountable obstacles, for it would create havoc for index investors and managers alike.

• Require index funds to hold just one company in any industry. Leaving aside the dubious ability of either academia or federal bureaucrats to define precisely what constitutes a given industry, such a drastic change would lead to the destruction of today’s S&amp;P 500 index fund, by common agreement, the most beneficial innovation for investors of the modern age.

• Timely and full public disclosure by index funds of their voting policies and public documentation of each engagement with corporate managers. This would take today’s transparent and constructive governance practices several steps further.

• Require index funds to retain an independent supervisory board with full responsibility for all decisions regarding corporate governance. The problem with this idea is that it is not clear how such a board could add to the present scrutiny of the fund’s independent directors.

• Limit the voting power of corporate shares held by index managers. But such a step would, in substance, transfer voting rights from corporate stock owners, who care about the long-term, to corporate stock renters, who do not... an absurd outcome.

• Enact federal legislation making it clear that directors of index funds and other large money managers have a fiduciary duty to vote solely in the interest of the funds’ shareholders. While I believe that such a fiduciary duty is implicit today, making it explicit, with appropriate penalties for violations, would be a constructive step.

It is time for public officials to consider the pros and cons of these issues with indexers, the financial community, academia, and active managers alike—and develop national policies that support high standards of corporate governance. It will require their working together constructively and cooperatively.

But one thing seems crystal clear. Even if present trends continue (sometimes they don’t), the enormous value of index funds should not be ignored. First, index funds provide investors with the most effective stock-market strategy of all time: buy American business and hold it forever, and do so at rock-bottom cost. Second, index funds are among the few truly long-term owners of stocks—for all practical purposes, permanent owners of capital—an enormously valuable asset to society. The long-term focus of index funds is a much needed counterweight to the short-termism favored by so many market participants.

Prof. Coates agrees that nothing should jeopardize the existence of today’s index funds.

“Indexing has created real and large social benefits in the form of lower expenses and greater long-term returns for millions of individuals investing directly or indirectly for retirement,” he writes. “A ban on indexing would clearly not be a good idea.” I can only say, “Amen” to those words.

personalfinance,Making a plan for medical school loans,"Hey all, I got accepted into med school and will be starting in fall 2019. I’m trying to make a plan on how to pay off loans as quick as possible. I’m 23 years old right now, and will be 30-32 once I’m an attending. My goal is to pay off my loans as quick as possible. 


I don’t have any undergrad debt, but the med school I will be attending is expensive, about $65k a year and my parents will cover my living expenses (rent,food,gas,books). I will be $260k in debt when I graduate and start residency, with an interest rate of 6.7%. 

Am I supposed to start paying off the loan during residency (salary is like $50k) or should I defer payment? 

Also, am I supposed to refinance the loan to a lower interest rate before residency or after residency?

Finally, is it smarter to go all out on the loan once I’m an attending and try to pay it off ASAP or should I focus on saving money for retirement/save for a house/invest and pay off the loan slower?  

Edit*
I’m also taking a gap year right now and working a job part time. I will have saved about $12k by the time I start school. Should I invest the money or use it as spending money during school?

personalfinance,Supporting my parents retirement,"This is a throwaway account:

My parents are getting older, and expressed they wanted to retire, but they have about a $135k\* in debt and expenses (they expect a retirement funds and social security for retirement and a final bonus from work) as is the usual for their line of work and country (not U.S).

The reason they are in this mess to begin with is because they choose to pay all expenses for their kids schooling and living costs (mine and my siblings) that came down to $450k over 10 years.

I'm the youngest, and while I am still in collage, thanks to this subbreddit and my parent I've been able to become financially independent 2 years ago, and was able to pay for my school, and starting this year my living costs as well and every other burden.

So my parents no longer need to pay for anyone other than themselves.

I got out my spreadsheet to calculate their situation and if they continue to work for 5 years, they can cover all costs, and have some more cushion money. But, they both want to retire as soon as possible.

My concern, is that they plan to take all the expect a retirement funds and final bonus, to throw it at the monstrous debt .. living them to live off of the social security which is NOT enough for them to live a dignified and enjoyable life, to pay for insurance, travel, keep their cars and independence, and sign up for stuff to do in their retirement.

I wiped out a spreadsheet to see where this monster begins and ends. Apparently, they pay a lot A LOT of interest.

&amp;#x200B;

$67k mortgage -  458/m

\-$13,500 checking account at a 12.5% interest rate. ( if this goes to -$14k, the interest rate goes up to 16%  (which they pay to the bank !!)

$13,500 loan  at a 10.5% interest rate

$1350 loan  at a 8.5 % interest rate

$20k loan  at a 6.5 % interest rate

A mess that is credit cards and debit cards

that total to up to 20,000

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know at what to chip at? from the interest the best thing to do is pay the checking account..

But the 13k loan has about 2700$ in interest that I can actually see, which is all just bonkers!  They are chipping at this, but randomly, and they did not realize that a lot of the money they already paid simply went strait to pay bank fees and interest rates.

I want to help against their pride, but I am not sure what to direct it at, would paying off the $1350 be a better start since this will be closing off one loan?  but the checking balance is very nearing to have the interest rate jack up.

Edit 1: wrong amount edited

Edit 2: I want to help them, they did not ask. But I agree with them retiring before their health deteriorate so that they ca enjoy life while they can.

Edit 3: Young, single, financially capable and want to help. No need to convince me that I should not do so.

Edit 4: someone already helped me figure out the MATHS behinds where to start.If someone has a creative way to go about this, I would love to hear it. But, math wise, I now understand that I should cover the checking account debt first.

investing,High Yield Savings vs Bonds vs Bond ETFs,"Hey y'all, first time posting here. I've been doing a lot of reading and the general recommendation for the typical stock/bond investment strategy I've seen for someone my age (26 years old) is to have 70-75% of my portfolio in stocks and 25-30% of my portfolio in bonds. To be clear, I'd like to stick to this % to reduce investment value volatility and hedge against bear markets or market corrections. However, I'd also like to ""protect"" myself from rising interest rates. 

&amp;#x200B;

Initially, I was just going to put the 30% into bond ETF indexes (15% in TLT (20+ year treasury bond index) and 15% IEF (7-10 year treasury bond index)). I then thought, given the rising interest rates, I should do 20-25% in IEF and 5-10% in TLT since rising interest rates affect the value of long-term bonds greater than short-term bonds. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next thought was if my bond investments are supposed to be the ""safe"" part of my portfolio with significantly smaller gains but preservation of capital rather than a source of growth during bear markets or corrections, why not just put the 25-30% of my portfolio into 1-year treasury bonds? No risk of 1-year treasury bond value going down due to rising interest rates (like there would be with the bond ETFs) and current 1-year treasury yield is at 2.7% and it's guaranteed. If interest rates continue to go up, I'd just keep buying 1-year treasury bonds. If they start to go down, I'd have to reevaluate. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then finally, I thought, why not just put the 25-30% into a high yield savings account? There are a couple out there with 2.0% yield. So, similar returns to the 1-year treasury bonds but with full liquidity and still guaranteed. Also, high yield savings account yields tend to go up with rising interest rates. 

&amp;#x200B;

The high yield savings account is my favorite option at the moment, but I'm curious what y'all here have to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: What's better for the portion of my investment portfolio that's supposed to be safe given present-day circumstances  (highest ever market numbers and rising interest rates): high yield savings account, bond ETFs, or 1-year treasury bonds. And why?

personalfinance,"Oops, I dug a hole for myself, and can't figure out how to escape.","TL;DR: Bankrupt for a second time, unemployed, but now with +100k combined student loans and tax debt.

This is longish, on mobile, and on a throwaway, since people know my main account. This may not seem like a large amount, but with it weighing over my head, it feels almost unbearable. Honestly don't know if posting this here is right, or of it should go into r/depression instead, LOL.

I fell into that ""you need a degree to get ahead in life"" thing, and went to school. I began my nationally accredited degree fresh out of bankruptcy, focusing on getting my bachelor's of business administration. My school was starting an accounting degree with a forensic emphasis at the time, and I was interested in it. Both the school, and my Dean (whom I became friends with, relevant later) knew about the bankruptcy. He always said that it was no big deal, and in today's climate, a lot of people have gone through it, and nobody wool care. I changed majors, with him giving me credit towards a lot of the accounting courses, since I had already completed a most of the high level business admin courses; I think I ended up with two classes that I needed to take to satisfy accounting, since he couldn't fudge it any further. He had parties at his home, with many of the students, while we were still in school. There were a couple cases of students hooking up with professors, LOL.

School was nearing an end, and he had a client that he wanted me to go work with. I took the job, was directly under his supervision, as a contractor. I, however, had never taken the tests to get my CPA license, and he knew this. He flaked out, tried to get my input on everything that was going on inside the office, while he was at home, basically doing an intense CYA thing. The whole time taking about getting all of those other students on board to work there too, even though the company wasn't large enough to require an accounting department of that size. My Spidey sense put me on guard for my client. Lawsuit happened, he tried to be a whistleblower on something that really didn't occur, but the lawsuit fizzled out. He vanished, apparently moving up near the Canadian border in ND, because the air is better there, or something. I did begin my Masters while I was working for the client, at a regionally accredited school this time, and am about 1/4 of the way compete. I took over full-time as the controller, though the business owner would refer to me as the CFO, even though I had no power. I really do feel as if the Dean was playing a long game of a lawsuit making him rich at students/clients expense.

Work with the client continued for quite some time, with me being under the supervision of the owners, the company's CPA and lawyer; still didn't have my license though. The IRS started converting the contractors to employees, because, in all actuality, that's what everyone was. With me seeing the conversion starting, I waited to file taxes, since I thought it would be easier to wait, then to try to get a refund for the difference.

I left the company, and found out just how shitty the job market was. The previous bankruptcy made it all but impossible to do anything involving money. A very long stretch of unemployment happened. In my mind, doing work here and there, under the table, made ends meet and let me stay fed. My taxes had never been filed, and I turned into a pretty big piece shit towards the bills that were outstanding, and the repossessed car.

I have tried to fix it though! I recently filed four years of taxes, and under my CPA's advice, the request to become an employee came with it, since i was unlicensed the entire time.  His reasoning was I could never be a contractor for them, with the type of supervision i was under, and the missing license. I'm now bankrupt, again (just waiting for the attorney to file), sold almost all of my assets over the past two years, have about 80k in student loans, another 30k in taxes owed to my the IRS and the state.  Still unemployed (sigh), and am now living at home; I'm almost 40! The stretch of not working hurts me, but a simple 30k/yr job, here, is just barely enough to survive with rent and what not, and is quite a bit below what my education should command. 30k also puts me into competition with high school graduates, but anything more requires either a license, more schooling, or years of experience/certifications that I don't have. 30k/yr doesn't even come close to putting a dent into my student loans, that for some reason, fell out of deferment two months early, or the IRS, who will also want their share.

What say you reddit? How to I dig my way out of this hole I've made? IMHO, owning anything of real value is out of my grasp now, and that even counts something as simple a as a better car that isn't quite as shitty as the 26 year old car I have now. 30k/yr with the government with their hand out leaves no room for building a savings account, let alone any kind of entertainment/vacation/buying a home (homes here start about $150, with $300-350k being what would be considered a standard middle class home). It makes it real difficult to want to push for a better life, but I can't stay in my current situation much longer. I've found myself hiding from the world a lot lately, because the head in the sand feeling is better than the stark reality of what I've created.

My only plus to all of this is that I have no alimony or child support due. I've never been married and never had kids.

personalfinance,What is the best way to pay off a high interest credit card? Throw money at it or get a lower interest loan and then throw money at that?,"Hi PF peoples! 



I'm trying to figure out this adulting thing and in the last couple of years, I've made a couple of mistakes. Right now I'm trying to figure out the best way to tackle my biggest debt. I have a credit card with a $15,000 limit and a $12,800 balance. It has an 18% interest rate (Dumb, I know) and the high usage rate is really affecting my credit score.  I am in the process of cutting the fat on my monthly spending to increase how much I can throw at this debt. The only other debt I have is my car loan, which I'll tackle next after this because the interest is -much- lower. 



I'm throwing money at it but a lot of it is getting sucked up by the interest. I spoke to my credit union and the person I spoke to was very friendly and tried to help me come up with a few options on how to get this handled. 



* 1) Keep throwing money at it. Currently, I'm dropping 1000 a month on it, but a large chunk of that is going towards the interest. 



* 2) Apply for another credit card and do a balance transfer so I have an interest free period of time to pay it down. I have average credit, around the mid 620s depending on which agency you ask. 



* 3) Apply for a loan with the CU that would hopefully have a lower interest rate. use the loan to pay off the balance and then pay down the loan as fast as I can. 



**My big question is this - which option is the 'best' option?** I am kinda favoring option 3. The way I see it is that the lower interest would give my a more cost effective way of paying this back and the usage on my card would go down, allowing me to work on repairing my credit rating while also paying off the debt. **A friend mentioned that they think this would be viewed poorly by the credit companies because i'm just moving the debt from one place to another, rather than paying it off and that this may actually affect my credit in a negative way. Is this really a thing?** They think option 1 is the way to go.  



*I know I have been sparse on details but I'm trying to keep myself unidentifiable. If more information is needed, I'll try to provide it.*


Thank you in advance for your time, advice and help!

personalfinance,What is best option for paying off debt,"Hi!  I'd love to hear some thoughts on my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Wife and I currently have $66k in credit card debt.  We've been addressing our spending, and do have a much better handle on it than when we got in to this situation.  Cutting budget is not much of an option though, at least not to pay down debt in a meaningful way.

&amp;#x200B;

Our house is worth about $1mm, and we owe about $370k, current interest rate is 3.75% with 25 years remaining on a 30 year mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

We just came in to some money, about $75k - it will be taxed at long term capital gains of 20%, so net $60k.  I have another $20k in taxable investments that I'm not planning on selling.  We are probably underfunded in our 401k ($250k, we are 45), and we have two kids (4 years until college for 1 of them, 6 years until college on the other, and have about $50k saved in 529 plans).

&amp;#x200B;

We've been exceptionally stressed out as the CC payments are starting to eat in to our living expenses, so retiring as much of that as possible would really be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

Question: We looked into a cash out refi to pay of CC debt, and was offered 4.78% fixed rate for 30 years.  That would close out our CC debt and allow us to keep the $60 as an emergency fund (something we do not have right now).  Or, should we look at using the cash on hand to pay down credit card debt?",finance

personalfinance,Paying off student loans - does subsidized vs. unsubsidized matter if the same rate?,"I'm currently on the IBR repayment plan but have been making some payments ahead of time. I understand that one should pay loans with the highest interest rate first. My remaining loans are split between two different rates - 6.55% and 6.3%. At both rates I have subsidized and unsubsidized. Does it really matter if I pay an unsubsidized 6.55% versus a subsidized 6.55%? I read online somewhere that you should pay off the unsubsidized before subsidized.... but, unless I'm missing something, why does it matter if the rates are the same?  


So, for instance, if I could pay $5K, does it matter if I pay that $5K to wipe out the complete $5K balance on an subsidized loan vs. decreasing a $15K unsubsidized loan to only $10K when both loans are the same rate?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Scammer Jared Rice (AriseBank) might be going to jail up for a looong time.,"Finally some justice in this world.

&amp;#x200B;

**""AriseBank CEO faces up to 120 years in prison over cryptocurrency scam**

**Jared Rice, Sr. was charged with duping hundreds of investors out of more than $4 million in a cryptocurrency scheme.""**

&amp;#x200B;

*AriseBank CEO Jared Rice, Sr. faces a heavy prison term. He was arrested by the FBI on Wednesday and charged with defrauding hundreds of investors in a cryptocurrency scheme.*

&amp;#x200B;

Rice, who is also the subject of a civil action filed by the SEC’s Fort Worth regional office earlier this year, was indicted on three counts of securities fraud and three counts of wire fraud.

&amp;#x200B;

According to court documents unsealed on Wednesday, **Rice, 30, allegedly lied to would-be investors, claiming that AriseBank – which he labeled as the world’s “first decentralized banking platform” based on a proprietary digital currency called AriseCoin – could offer consumers FDIC-insured accounts and traditional banking services, including Visa-brand credit and debit cards, in addition to cryptocurrency services. In fact, AriseBank had not been authorized to conduct banking in Texas, was not FDIC insured, and did not have any sort of partnership with Visa.**

&amp;#x200B;

Even as he touted AriseBank’s nonexistent benefits in press releases and online, **Rice converted investor funds for his own personal use, spending the money on hotels, food, clothing, and a family law attorney.**

&amp;#x200B;

He allegedly falsely claimed the “Initial Coin Offering,” or ICO, had raised $600 million within just a few weeks and failed to disclose that he’d plead guilty to state felony charges in connection with a prior Internet-related business scheme. Meanwhile, investors were buying AriseCoin using digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and fiat currency.

&amp;#x200B;

If convicted, Rice faces up to 120 years in federal prison.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this month, Maksim Zaslavskiy pleaded guilty before United States Magistrate Judge Ramon E. Reyes, Jr. in federal court in Brooklyn to conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with two Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) – REcoin Group Foundation, LLC (REcoin) and DRC World, Inc., also known as Diamond Reserve Club (Diamond). He faces prison term of up to five years.

**What is Time Series?**

A time series is a sequence of measurements done over time, usually obtained at equally spaced intervals, be it daily, monthly, quarterly or yearly. Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.

In other words, a time series is a sequence of data points being recorded at specific times.

Some of the examples of time series may be:

* Daily air temperature or monthly precipitation in Bangalore, India
* Annual flow volume of the River Ganga at Patna
* Annual Indian population data
* Daily closing stock prices
* Weekly interest rates

Bitcoin,The Bitcoin Futures On CME Are Definitely The Reason For Bitcoin’s Price Crash,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ivsnbqvm2f121.jpg

[http://genesisblocknews.com/the-bitcoin-futures-on-cme-are-definitely-the-reason-for-bitcoins-price-crash/](http://genesisblocknews.com/the-bitcoin-futures-on-cme-are-definitely-the-reason-for-bitcoins-price-crash/)

This is a followup article to [http://genesisblocknews.com/paper-bitcoins-have-the-potential-to-ruin-the-bitcoin-market/](http://genesisblocknews.com/paper-bitcoins-have-the-potential-to-ruin-the-bitcoin-market/)  As I did the research for that story, I had a serendipity moment where I  realized without any doubt that CME has caused the Bitcoin bear market  of 2018. The launch of Bitcoin Futures on CME on 17 December 2017  coincided exactly with the end of the rally and the beginning of the  crash. [The opening price on CME was USD 20,650, and by the end of that same day Bitcoin was at USD 19,055](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/17/worlds-largest-futures-exchange-set-to-launch-bitcoin-futures-sunday-night.html). [Just look at the long term chart](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitfinex/btcusd), 17 December 2017 was the day where the Bitcoin market went from positive to negative.

The Bitcoin futures on CME are cash settled, meaning there is no  Bitcoins involved in their trading or settling at all. Therefore,  Bitcoin futures contracts on CME are paper Bitcoins. Each paper Bitcoin  issued on CME diverts demand away from the Bitcoin spot market, lowering  Bitcoin’s price, and also increases the total supply of Bitcoin beyond  the actual Bitcoins in existence.

CME Bitcoin futures contracts are 5 Bitcoins each, and settled once a  month. The volume of Bitcoin futures has been rapidly increasing, as  Bitcoin dives lower and lower, and this is not a coincidence. The higher  the volume of Bitcoin futures, the more paper Bitcoins that are  printed.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/b8eu4c6f2f121.png

In Q3 2018, on average 757,950 paper Bitcoins were traded per month.  While the spot market volume is much higher than this, the printing and  trading of this many paper Bitcoins per month has a massive impact on  diluting the Bitcoin supply and diverting demand away from the spot  markets. In the global financial markets Bitcoin is no longer as scarce,  since anyone can deposit money at CME and print paper Bitcoins and  trade them, even if every actual Bitcoin in the world was being HODLED.

If you do not believe me regarding the connection between the CME Bitcoin futures and the decline in Bitcoin’s price, [the Federal Reserve issued a statement during May 2018 affirming that CME ruined Bitcoin’s price](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2018/may/how-futures-trading-changed-bitcoin-prices/).  Apparently the introduction of futures markets to other asset classes  in the past has also caused a long term price decline. The Federal  Reserve says that before Bitcoin futures launched optimists, i.e.  Bitcoiners that actually cared about Bitcoin, were in control, and  pessimists, i.e. the establishment that hates Bitcoin, had no mechanism  to bet against Bitcoin’s price. Once Bitcoin futures launched, people  that did not like Bitcoin could bet against its price as much as they  wanted to via short selling.

Implicitly, the Federal Reserve is saying that if Bitcoin futures did  not launch on CME, then Bitcoin would have rose well beyond USD 20,000.  The launch of the CME Bitcoin futures was such a powerful action that  it immediately halted the rally, as institutional investors began short  selling mass amounts of Bitcoin, while diverting demand away from the  spot markets and printing Bitcoins simultaneously.

CME is in control of COMEX, [as mentioned in the previous article.](http://genesisblocknews.com/paper-bitcoins-have-the-potential-to-ruin-the-bitcoin-market/)  COMEX acts to suppress and devalue the global price of gold at the  expense of everyone else in the world who holds gold, by issuing 360  times more paper gold than the physical gold they have.

The CME Bitcoin futures are far more malicious than COMEX, since  clients cannot have their Bitcoin delivered under any circumstances,  unlike the gold futures which have a delivery option. Further, it seems  COMEX at least keeps the gold price stable or slightly devaluing, while  the Bitcoin futures on CME are going full steam ahead to crash Bitcoin’s  price as far as possible.

The government is fearful of Bitcoin, [as explained in an article I wrote a day ago](http://genesisblocknews.com/the-government-knows-bitcoin-is-the-superior-form-of-money-and-they-are-fearful/),  and the approval of paper Bitcoins on CME, and simultaneous rejection  of financial instruments backed by actual Bitcoins, is proof that the  government is launching a coordinated attack on Bitcoin. The government  has basically given the green light for institutional investors to steal  as much money as they want out of the Bitcoin market via the CME  Bitcoin futures, since that serves the purpose of destroying the Bitcoin  market, even if it is morally wrong and probably illegal. If Bitcoin  overtakes the USD as the primary global currency, the government would  lose most of its power, and therefore they will bend the law to prevent  that.

[GenesisBlockNews](http://genesisblocknews.com) believes the Bitcoin community does not have to be  docile about this. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is  required by law to protect investors, and in this case their approval of  Bitcoin futures on CME is ruining the entire Bitcoin market and causing  millions of Americans to lose tremendous amounts of money (not to forget many more people around the world). This is  illegal, it could be proven in a court of law, and the Bitcoin futures  in Chicago could be halted via a class action lawsuit combined with  widespread protests.

Hopefully this article provides the knowledge people need to start  fighting back. Bitcoin did not begin falling, and would have never  crashed like this, if it was not for the launching of CME’s Bitcoin  futures, which facilitates the mass theft of money from all Bitcoiners. It is time for Bitcoiners to get angry and aggressively protest CME.",cryptocurrency

To help I have about 6,000 in credit card debt, 6,000 in student loans, and 18,500 on an auto loan.

personalfinance,Should I try to raise my credit card limits to get a better utilization ratio?,"During my junior year of college I got a $250 student credit card, from a credit union near my home town, to start building some sort of credit since I knew I'd want to refinance my private loans as soon as possible after graduation. I paid it off completely every month until a few months ago. When I graduated in May I was expecting to start work the following week (That is what they said during the interview). That didn't happen due to HR stuff and I ended up having to wait 2 months before I could start. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't have a job that could pay the bills for \~2 months and I ended up opening another card, from another credit union, with a $1000 limit. Over those 2 months I ended up maxing both cards out to cover rent/groceries. I wasn't financially responsible when I got my first few pay checks and ended up only paying the minimums/using them again. Now I have to start paying my student loans back and I can only afford to put \~$50-75 a month towards the cards. If I am responsible with the cards going forward, would it be smart to try and raise my limits so I don't have a 100% utilization? I want to grow my credit over the next few months by paying my student loans and then refinance. I can't do this which such high credit utilization though. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be smart to apply to a new card or try to raise one of the cards limits? I'm thinking about joining Navy Federal and closing or emptying the account near my hometown since they don't have any local branches where I live. If I apply for a new card should I look into Navy Federal cards or somewhere else? This would mean I would have 3 bank accounts with 3 credit cards, not sure if that's smart.

**TL;DR:** I have a credit limit of $1250 between 2 cards ($1000 and $250) and I have a balance of $950 and $220 respectfully. I can only put $50-$75 a month to these cards and I was wondering if I should see if I can raise my limit or open a new card to have a better utilization ratio? I have student loans I'd like to refinance and a high utilization ratio is hurting my credit/preventing me from refinancing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I make 62k a year and have \~100k in student loans if this factors in at all.",finance

personalfinance,"Ally Bank holding ""Bill Pay"" funds for not yet cashed checks? Why?","I've set up my Ally account to automatically mail my landlord a check for rent.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually this is withdrawn when my landlord cashes the check (anywhere from 1-2 weeks after the delivery date). However, sometimes Ally ""withdraws"" the funds on the day the check was delivered (i.e. the landlord does NOT receive the funds on this day).

&amp;#x200B;

The FAQ on Ally's website has this to say: ""For some checks, the money is withdrawn on the scheduled delivery date. For others, the money is withdrawn when the payee deposits or cashes the check.""

But there is no indication as to ""why"". Last time I called and they wouldn't give me a straight answer as to why.

&amp;#x200B;

This time, it reduced my account balance below the $15000 minimum for the higher interest rate on checking. Assuming a 2 week delay on the check cash, it's only $3.50, but still feels bad.

personalfinance,Can I theoretically tax-deduct the entire amount of an item purchased to perform my job as an independent contractor? (TN-USA),"Let's say I work for a house-cleaning service as an independent contractor in the state of Tennessee. They require me to purchase my own cleaning supplies, including a vacuum (~ $100 total). My gross income that year is, say, $20k. I know that the vacuum would be considered a business expense and qualifies for some kind of tax deduction, which would lower my taxable income which could put me in a different tax bracket, but I have always been under the impression that it was dollar-for-dollar. I'm not sure why. How does it work exactly?

While I'm already here asking pretty stupid questions, how do tax credits or deductions in general work? I have never earned enough to pay federal income taxes after standard deductions and my state doesn't have an income tax. I've seen politicians saying that we should give a ..tax credit? for health insurance premiums for individuals? I think?

personalfinance,First Paycheck Taxes at 60+% - help,"Hi all. New to the USA and just started a new job. Got my first paycheck and 60+% is withheld for taxes, mostly federal. Clearly my W-4 is screwed up.

Relevant info:

Salary is 85k, wife's is 70k. Filed as married, wife as married withholding at higher rate. Two earners. No dependents. Both in first couple of  weeks of new jobs in this country.

Any ideas where I may have gone wrong? 

Edit:

So I think I marked as married filing jointly, then calculated my allowances as if married filling jointly, rather than separately. Is it also possible my employer isn't using part-year tax withholding? Obviously I will ask them directly, but reddit is orders of magnitude more responsive than the HR team. I'm still waiting on them to respond to my initial ticket. Corporate life.

EDIT 2:

So...I put in my yearly salary in the original W-4, but I will only work 3 pay periods this year. 

My wife did the same. Her paycheck is fine. Her company has obviously done part year withholding, mine hasn't. An article on smart asset I read suggested part year withholding is the employer's responsibility, while u/ronnevee suggested it is the employee's responsibility. Any clarity on this matter?

personalfinance,Healthcare options between jobs and avoidance of penalty? (NJ),"I'm transitioning between jobs and my health benefits terminate on my final day, but don't kick in for 60 days at my new job. I've been trying to figure out my options, and I can't get any straight answers. The good news is that for 2019 the federal government removed the penalty fee for being uninsured, but New Jersey added a penalty of their own for 2019. So what are my options? COBRA is way too expensive for me. According to some sources I Googled, New Jersey law prohibits the sale of private short-term health insurance policies.  I have no health problems, and hopefully won't need to see a doctor in these two months, so I'm just looking to avoid the penalty as cheaply as possible. Anyone familiar with this new NJ law that could predict what my penalty fee would be? The only thing I can find online is the law in it's entirety, and I'm no lawyer. Thanks for any help!",finance
personalfinance,How do I get out of this car loan that is crushing me (1/4th of my income alone),"So I was in a loan with my ex long before I learned the tip not to finance anyone, anything unless you are married. Well low and behold, after 4.5 years she left me and now i'm stuck with a car loan I can afford, but realistically I feel like i'm being crushed underneath the immense weight of the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

The car itself is worth 22,000, and the amount I have on the loan is 28,000. Upside down, which is another huge whammy. On the upside its on a 1.8% interest rate which isn't very high for a brand new car (At the time it was) and I've had it for 2 years now.

&amp;#x200B;

The payment is 529, and the insurance for full coverage on it alone (I'm only 22) is $202 which seems a bit absurd.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I realistically do to get rid of this car payment? I was thinking about trading the car in and going super cheap but IDK if thats even feasable. I just want to get rid of the amount I owe on it, so I can use what I'd normally be paying to crush my credit card debt and get rid of that behemoth as well.",finance
personalfinance,does this saving strategy make sense?,"Hello!

I would describe myself as fairly responsible financially: I have an emergency fund, retirement fund that I'm regularly contributing to, out of debt, etc. That said, I want to start being a little more strategic about my medium-term savings goals. Some of these are just monthly goals (I'd like to put aside x percent of my income towards charitable donations) and some are one time spends (I'd like to save x amount for my honeymoon). Some are kind of combo goals (like, I'd like to put a certain percentage towards travel, and separately, I have this fixed amount that I know I spend on traveling per year, but also specific non-necessary trips to save up for). 

&amp;#x200B;

Something I've been intrigued by in the past is the savings plan of having a lot of different accounts set up without a minimum balance requirement, and treating each one as a budget category. So, maybe I'd have accounts set up labeled as travel, shopping, education, rent, and then my income is automatically distributed between those accounts based on percentages I choose. Here are my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) I think I've read that people recommend CapitalOne 360 for this kind of thing. Anyone agree or disagree? Pros or cons?

2) Does anyone think this general strategy is bad? Like, there's another way to accomplish similar goals with a better interest rate, or it's pointless to have the different accounts and I might as well just track on a spreadsheet, or something similar? 

&amp;#x200B;

In case it's helpful: I have tried budgeting with Mint, but when it comes to specific savings goals, they require one dedicated account to it (I think). So if I have a big Vanguard index fund account, and I imagine some will go towards retirement and some towards buying a house, Mint doesn't like that. I've also tried managing with Mint through a monthly budget that can roll over between months, but what I've found is that when the money is all in the same pot, I have a hard time stopping myself from using it for whatever I want. The way I envision the Capital One account is that I have a sort of central checking account for basic fixed expenses (rent, groceries, etc), and then if I spend more than that, I need to transfer it in from a specific other account--so even if I'm cheating, I still have to ultimately decide ""well I'm overbudget, so I'm losing money for traveling).

personalfinance,Are Social Security and Medicare Tax taken from gross pay or taxable wages?,"Recently I changed my traditional 401k contributions so that a more significant chunk of my earnings will be put into my retirement (from 5% to about 35%). As a result, the percentage of my state income tax and federal income tax have dropped since my taxable wages have dropped as expected. However, i noticed that there was no change in my social security and medicare tax. 

This may be a really dumb question, but I was unable to find a straight answer when trying to google the question. Is social security and medicare tax taken before my 401k contributions? In other words, do those taxes apply on my gross income for that pay period?",finance

personalfinance,Wife got laid off and our request for increased Pel Grand did the opposite.,"As the title states, my wife was laid off her job earlier last month. She is enrolled in an online school and almost complete with her degree. She reached out to her student advisor who recommended we out in a petition to have her Pel Grant increased since she has a change of circumstance. We submit the request and they review the case. She gets a call later that week telling her that we are not getting an increase but actually now owe. Apparently when they re-ran her FASFA, they discovered that they were giving my wife too much and we now owe them hundreds of dollars. We are appealing that decision and they are requesting I submit to them written confirmation from my previous employers that I was employed by them for XYZ amount and my last paycheck stub and I guess they will compare it to our taxes that we submitted?

We are very frustrated by all this. Feels like we are getting kicked while we are down. It doesn't add up to me as to why they need me to get all this documentation stating that I was employed and paid according to my taxes. I was able to get them a letter from my previous job with the requested information. I have a pretty good working relationship with them. I do not have easy access to my old paychecks from either two of my employers that year as everything was electronic and I dont have access to those particular accounts. Is this even necessary for them? Why arent my taxes enough? I am getting pretty upset at this point. Pel Grant is a federal grant. If they messed up is it on us to make up the difference?

personalfinance,Should I invest or put money toward student loan debt? And how to save for big purchases in addition?,"I need help deciding what to do with my income/savings now that I have a six month emergency fund. My main question is, **should I do any investing, or put as much money as I can toward student loan debt?** If I should put more money toward student loan debt, how should I save for big expenses in the future—car, home, child? The flow chart gets murky at this point. 

**My situation**

* Me (32) and partner (33) with no kids, but plan to have one within 2-4 years

* Pre-tax household income of ~140k (partner income fluctuates; currently between gigs, expect HH income to increase when she gets FT work)

* Live in Seattle, rent is $1750 /mo

* 100k federal student loan debt. Rates between 5.1% and 6.9%. Avg 6.35%. I pay $1100 /mo. Graduated repayment plan. Some months I pay more, targeting higher interest loans.

* Partner has ~25k in debt. No other debt between us.

* Average monthly net income (after paying all expenses / debt) is $1300 /mo

* 38k in savings (24k of which is my 6mo emergency fund)

* 8k in checking 

* 10k in 401k (late start to my career), employer contributes 3% regardless of what I contribute, so I am not contributing anything currently

* No other investments

**So, should I do any investing?** Paying off my student loans is a safe 6.35% “ROI,” but it seems like index funds have higher growth averaged over 10+ years. And if I’m focused on student debt, my net worth might get out of the red, but I’m not building up liquidity for something like a downpayment for a home.

* Should I start up a Roth IRA?

* In terms of saving for large purchases in 3-10 years like a home down payment or having a kid, what kind of account is best for that? We don’t have specific target numbers in mind, though if we stay in the Seattle area, a downpayment for a home is going to be $$$. Even for a condo we might expect to put 100k down.

personalfinance,401k to Down Payment for House,"I'll provide as much useful information as I can. I'll try an answer questions if asked without giving away too much personal information. TL/DR at bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: 31 male, 75k salary (mechanical engineer), \~730 credit score, debt \~95k + in which 78k is student loans on IBR.

Wife: 31 female, 15-20k per year (contract therapist), \~780 credit score, debt 100k+, 85k are student loans on IBR.

Using only my salary:

75k Gross / 12 months =  $6250 gross/month

30% (Housing Golden Rule) of that is $1875 per month. This is way more than I plan on spending. Looking at 200-250k mortage. 250k mortage would be about $1100 per month not counting PMI and taxes (&gt;1500 / month total). I pay $915 in rent now.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been renting my apartment for 8 years now, currently pay $915 per month for 1k sq. ft. So affording 900-1300 per month is not an issue just the down payment. We have a baby that is almost 1 years old and another on the way due in June. I make \~75k per year my wife makes 15-20k? (she's contract part-time). We already have tax liability in which we'll need to pay her share of taxes but this pretty much get offset by my tax return and child credits. That is what happened last year.

&amp;#x200B;

I have about \~12k in my 401k (Vanguard) from my previous employer. I have recently started a new job. Different 401k company (Principal). I know I can take a check or installments as an option with my 401k. I can push most likely to get a payout in 2018 or wait until 2019 due to 60 day waiting period from employer/employee seperation.  I would like to use this 401k payout as my down payment on a house i'll be buying in a few months. I have spoke with Vanguard rep and they started laying out the fees and taxes and stuff i'd have to pay to get the check. They mentioned 20% federal holding for taxes + state taxes (Michigan). There are other implications and taxes at the end of the year. I know you guys are not going to like me doing this but this is realistically the best way for me to get a down payment put together. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a savings other than my 1k emergency fund, I have no other investments. We have moderate amount of debt (under control) each we've put in some serious work in the past year. I'm looking for houses in the 200-250k range, looking to start the process of hunting End of Feb / Early March with offers and closing. My apartment lease is up July 1. We have a good relationship with the management company and could probably get out in May / June if all things line up. They are going to need to gut our apartment anyway (8 years of living).

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm a first time home buyer so i'll be most likely utilizing FHA and the 1-3% down payment. If i'm using rough numbers and lets says I get 50% of my 401k \~6k that plus whatever I could come up with would be more than I needed for closing and down payment.

&amp;#x200B;

Please give me some honest advice, if you have a similar story I would love to hear the good and the bad. I know there might be other options like no down payment but I don't wana risk that and not be able to buy a house. My next logical step would be to consulate a tax professional. But I wanted to reach out here since i'm an avid follower and have given great advice in the past.

The spread of lies oozed like dye into water as Fab’R secretly campaigned to overthrow the leadership of TDZ and made an underhanded deal with the players of BR$.   Fab’R poisoned the mind of his minions as they ransacked the workshop, sent alliance mail to urge others to abandon their team, changed their alliance bulletin and then fled to the enemy lines.

The rest of TDZ was left aghast. OB5 swooped in to their aid. Epicfish demanded the traitors were placed on trial for their treasonous crimes, but BR$ scoffed and retorted they would do no such thing.   Fab’R cried innocence to the northern allies who gave him shelter. OB5 hosted the refugees of TDZ who have been brutally betrayed by their former teammates.

OB5 transformed into OBZ to welcome their new members and assist them in their swift justice.   TDZ loyalists formed together to create LIST OF TRUTH where the players who left them to die would be burned in effigy.
