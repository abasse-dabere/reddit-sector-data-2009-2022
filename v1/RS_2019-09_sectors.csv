personalfinance,Recent College Graduate Financial Advice,"Hey guys so as the title say I just recently graduated from college in May 2019 and am currently making $39,975 per year ($20.50) per hour, and need some input on the financial plan I've created using info from this subreddit and excel. Let me know if I didn't account for anything!

Debt:

I currently have one private 11.75% APR student loan of $4,920 and a variety of subsidized and unsubsidized government loans with an average interest rate of about 4.4% totaling about $28,600. Both are in grace, the government loans until 1/08/2020 and the private one I honestly have no clue because the portal it's housed on won't tell me when the next payment is due. 

Expenses:

I'm living at home and borrow a car from my mother to commute to work (about 20 minutes each way) and pay about $200 to her for this and also to remain on her car/health insurance and phone plan (very grateful for all this!). So I've only budgeted about $450 for expenses and I rarely ever burn through it all as I'm really only paying for food/gas, so what remains I put some towards my loans and some into a savings account for emergency fund.  

My Plan: Given $29265.86 real income following 401k contribution (up to company match, 4.5% match on 6%) and taxes

So currently I'm making a consistent $1500 payment every month ($750 per paycheck, my pay periods are 2 weeks) towards my loans. This should allow me to pay off my big daddy 11.75% interest loan by the end of the year (any greater amount will only save me 10's of dollars based on my plug and play so I figured it's a good amount) and my larger principle government loans in 20 months after that (assuming no increases in expenses or pay). I have to look into paying the minimum on the subsidized ones and more on the higher interest ones, but that's a headache I've left for after I've paid off my high interest one. 

So in summary my current monthly budget is: $1500 loans, $200 mother payment, $451.22 expenses, $100 recreation. Also, I have a credit card that's 0% APR until January 2021, and was planning on using it to build up my credit and also for expenses while making minimum monthly payments until the APR kicks in (at which time I'll have the balance at 0, I'll adjust the monthly payment as I accumulate debt on it) to free up more money for my actively accruing loans.

I really hate debt so I want to focus on paying my mine down before accumulating any more expenses (i.e. significant rent) or loans (i.e. a car loan). I don't see a way to get a better return on my investment than the 4.4% I will from paying off my government loans so I figured this was the best course of action.  

Anyway let me know what you think and if I've missed anything!",finance
personalfinance,Credit Score Confusion for Home Mortgage,"My wife and I are in the final stages of closing on our first home, but before we do we are in need of finalizing our loan details with the private lender we are working with. My credit is 715 and my wifes is 637. Being that my wifes is the lower of the 2, that is the one they are going to use to establish the interest rate for our FHA loan. My question is, because my wifes credit was (3 points) shy of the next teir score of 640, our current interest rate estimate\* came to 4.125%. The lender shared that he ran that score 6 weeks ago

Our lender says we can run the credit again for a final, official interest rate- and he believes the credit score will have improved.

1. Is there any risk of having him run the score again for a potentially better rate?
2. Is there any risk to saying no?
3. \*Is this 'estimate' number total bs or will it be in the ballpark of the final figure?
   1. if its an estimate, dont we HAVE to run the scores again to get a formal/official rate?",finance

personalfinance,[Debt] Advice for a student loan of 40k after one year of college a decade ago.,"Hi there! Long time lurker. I'm kinda lost regarding a federal loan I got about 12 years ago for college. It was a federal pell (loan) for 40k for 4 years of school. However, after the first year I left that school; before going to a trade school (Where I got another loan for 15k). 


Since then I've been making payments, but the amount owed still doesn't seem to be going down (still around 40k with the interest). The loan was supposed to go directly to the school; but since I was there for only 2 semesters (1 year) I don't know why the school took the entirety of the loan. I thought after I left the school, the school shouldn't have gotten paid, and I would only be responsible for the amount used. 

I figured I'd ask here for any advice, and I'm not sure what other info I need to give. Is there a chance the school made a clerical error?  The $40,000 was supposed to be for 4 years, and have been making payments for just over a decade.

personalfinance,Pay down high balance or high interest card,"Basically what the subject says.  I’m not as worried about paying my high balance card all the way down. It’s a zero interest card used for a home improvement project that went over budget.  I’m getting money in January to pay it off well before the end of the zero interest period.  But I put more on it than I expected $9,800 on a $10k limit (my bank app says I still have $1000 credit available but $10k is what I signed up for).  I was told I should not spend all the way to the limit because it would affect my credit.  I put more than I planned honestly.

And then I have this other cash back card with a 15% interest rate that I usually pay off every month.  The extra from the project ended up on that because it has a high limit that I never normally get close to.

But now I don’t know if it’s more important to take care of my credit by paying a thousand or so off the high balance card, or if it’s more pressing to pay off the balance that is charging me interest as fast as possible.

personalfinance,getting paid cash + not filing taxes last year; will i get in trouble when applying for aid programs?,"So last year I worked various random odd jobs and got paid cash for them. I do things like gardening, filing, data entry, helping with cleaning and organization, etc; just random stuff for a few different people and got paid cash. 

In the past a few years ago when i tried to be honest and file my taxes from getting paid cash it was kind of a cluster\*\*\* because it got one of my ""employers"" in trouble with the IRS for a bit. They got audited and everything turned out fine but it was super anxiety inducing because they were angry with me and I was afraid I'd lose the gig, which is my main source of income. That was in like... 2016? I don't remember.

For a while I also worked a ""real"" job with a W2, so of course I filed for that, but left off any record of the cash odd jobs, still.

That ""real"" job ended in 2017 and I kept going with the cash odd jobs, so for 2018 i figured I didn't want to risk getting in trouble again by filing on my cash income (and I figured I didn't really make enough money to bother filing anyway since I am a full time student and only worked sporadically when my class/assignments load allowed it).   


Fast forward to this year, and my living situation is drastically changing. My relationship just ended and I'm going to have to move but I can barely afford to support myself. I spoke with some folks at my school and they recommended I apply for my state's version of foodstamps, as well as a couple of state/federal aid programs to help me not end up hungry and/or homeless, which are both real possibilities at this point.  


How does getting paid under the table and not filing taxes last year affect my ability to receive aid? In the process of filling out the paperwork for one of the aid programs I went back and calculated my income for last year, which turned out to be roughly $10,400 for the whole year, so still not much but I probably should have filed, right? I already renewed my FAFSA and checked off ""did not file"" during that process.   


I am generally inclined to be morally responsible and do all this stuff aboveboard but the situation with my ""employer"" getting audited and being super mad at me was just so traumatizing that I didn't want to deal with it again and now I'm afraid it's all going to come back and bite me in the ass just when I need help the most. I'm not sure whether to state on these aid forms that I made $10,400 last year or if I should stick with my ""story"" that I didn't make any taxable income.

investing,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",finance

Hello everyone!

I racked up a huge amount of credit card debt while I was homeless so that I could stay afloat and go to school. I am planning on pulling out a larger than necessary student loan to pay off my credit card, through the reimbursement. I feel it would be the same as taking out a loan for lower interest on my credit card and I do not have the finances to really impact my CC debt.  That s why I put 17,300 next to the 65,000 private loans. Then upon graduating and finding a decent job I would continually refinance my private student loans.

I did some research on expected monthly income with 12-16 hours of OT for new grad nurses in NYC and I found anywhere from 5,000- 6,200 a month (after taxes). I plan on dedicating nearly half my income toward repaying the private student loans.

The 350-400/ month on food is all from the grocery store, meal prepped, healthy foods. One thing I'm not going to compromise on is my health. I'm not willing to eat dollar slices for the next couple years of my life. I've eaten just ramen noodles and peanut butter straight out of the jar in the past, I'm not letting myself do that again.

Forex,"Commodities, Bonds, Stocks and Currencies","Let's discuss.

Here's what I have found so far, and correct me if I am wrong:

If commodity prices are increasing, there's an inherent fear of inflation.  Interest rates are increased to bring the commodity prices down.

If interest rates are increased, bond yields also need to increase, and so, bond prices go down.

So, commodities increasing, bond prices go down and bond yields increase.

When bond prices go down, yields are increasing, stock market goes down.

Because, obviously.

And because commodities are increasing, obviously the currency is cheap, also going down.

*So then, do we have commodities and bond yields inversely proportional to stocks, currencies and bonds?*  Too simplistic?

Given this inter market relationship, we see what is happening today:

\-- USD solid strong

\-- Commodities like oil, dirt cheap

\-- Bond prices going high while bond yields crazy low

\-- and our stock market at record highs!

Additionally, we also have QE.  How does QE affect these relationships?

This will not help us trade in and out of a trade but a good macro level to keep in mind, I guess?",finance
personalfinance,How to get CCs to lower interest rate on a 5-year or so payment plan without missing payments?,"OK, here's my situation.  I am an ""early retiree"" with about $20K in CC debt, but have a decent Roth IRA with plenty of 5-year conversion basis to tap (i.e., at no tax or penalty).  I'm still up to date on the payments.  I currently own my home (debt-free) but am looking to finance a new home, which I plan to qualify for via a combination of the IRA and a small pension I will begin receiving in a year or so - so I would really like to have a clean credit history when I apply for that.  I should say that almost 10 years ago I got a much higher amount of CC and other unsecured debt discharged from a Chapter 7 bankruptcy ($160K), but unlike then, I think I may have more non-exempt assets that I would need to purchase back from the trustee, and so if it came down to it, I would distribute cash from the IRA to pay off everything, so I don't consider that to be an option this time.  I could pursue the plan of letting my payments go off for a while, and then asking for a balance cut deal, but that could seriously imperil my new home mortgage, so again, I don't want to go down that path.  So I think I will need to pay this debt off.

So the question is, how to get my CCs to basically lower the interest rate.  I was figuring on simply saying that I am considering bankruptcy, but that if I could get all my CCs to give me better terms, I think I could avoid bankruptcy.  I couldn't care less if these cards want to close my account (OK, maybe there is one I would like to keep around).  It seems that the CCs would have to consider whether they want to continue to charge me 24% and possibly end up with little in Chapter 7, or not be so piggish and take 0% and get paid off.

I was thinking about joining the air force as a medical entomologist, so that I could get help from the repayment or forgiveness program, but at the same time I'm not sure if that's a good idea. I also thought about putting about 3-5k (emergency fund) into ally or another bank with higher apy, 2k in my pnc checking for easy access, and then putting the rest of it in a roth IRA or just in stocks, but it seems like we're going to hit a recession soon so shouldn't I wait to invest?

personalfinance,Car loan for 18 year old with no credit history.,"TL:DR: no credit but want to get a car loan by next year. Have 2k ready for down payment by then, but if I can’t get a co-signer how would I figure out my interest rate for the loan. :) 



Someone please give good advice, research on the net is getting me overwhelmed.

Here’s the basics. I work in NJ, and currently make $10/hr, but that will change in January, raising to $11/hr (yay!!). Now I want to get a used car. I’ve been researching on Edmunds and doing some math, and could afford a 2,100 down payment on a 13,000 car, by February if I follow that 10% down rule. I want to place a bigger down payment than the 10 % so I can pay less monthly if possible, I plan on paying $324 each month for 60 months again, if possible. (If I’m wrong about that don’t hesitate to tell me if I did my math wrong!!). 

Now the confusion. I have 0 credit history. But I have a possibility of getting a co-signer. The thing that is confusing me is if i can’t get the co signer, I know that the interest will be through the roof, but how can I calculate the correct rate that I would pay w/o credit? Also, how much of a loan should I take out? Any answers would be greatly appreciated. :)",finance

personalfinance,Cash or finance new large purchase?,"Throwaway. Mobile, sorry if formatting sucks.

Alright PF, quick question regarding my upcoming pool construction. Currently, we have no debt outside our primary residence (3.5% fixed 1st). We have a current LTV of about 35% with tons of equity. We are in the preliminary planning phases of our new pool. The question is do we pay cash or finance due to the low interest rates? 

If we pay cash, we drop our emergency reserves to about 4 months (full salary, not expenses) but can build it back up to 6 months pretty quickly (it currently sits at about 10 months). We fully contribute to 401k and IRAs.

If we finance we will keep our 10 months reserves and a ridiculously low loan: fixed 2nd 15 yr @ 3.67% APR. Goal would be to pay it off in 5 or less. 

Should we take advantage of the low interest rate for peace of mind of not depleting our reserves down to 4 months or just bite the bullet and write a check?

Yes, debt is bad. But it’s so cheap and does provide that safety net of just in case... Any other advice or considerations that I’m not thinking of?

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,What to do with non running financed vehicle?,"Our 2010 Jeep Commander died a month ago. It suffered one of the ""catastrophic failures"" Chrysler 3.7s are apparently known for (which I didn't know was a thing until it happened even though I searched high and low for this stuff before purchasing it). The motor is done at 150k. 

We have just under two years left on our loan and no way to just pay it off. Running, the car was worth just about what we owe. It's going to cost a lot to repair. As in, $3-5k depending on who you talk to and how much the motor and labor end up costing. So, it'll cost almost as much as the vehicle is worth in running condition. 

We owe $6,334. 

What are my options here? 

Will a dealership take it on trade in and pay off the loan while rolling the balance into a new loan? Am I stuck paying this vehicle off myself and paying to fix it? 

What is the best thing to do in this scenario? 

Our payments are $341/mo on this vehicle with a super high (12.99%) interest rate. We purchased it right out of chapter 7 (medical debt to the tune of $90k) to help repair our credit. I don't really want several more years of car payments and was really looking forward to having the vehicle paid off, but if we could roll the balance into another vehicle and keep payments the same or lower, it wouldn't put a strain on us... It would just set us back in our goal of having no more car payments. Which is a bummer.",finance
personalfinance,HSA or HRA (thoughts?),"Background: I’m starting a new job next week and am stuck between choosing an to enroll in the HSA or HRA option. Both are exactly the same (same 30/mo premium, $1500 deductible, copay, 3k out of pocket max, etc.) but the HRA will reimburse $750 per year and work won’t contribute anything to the HSA.

The Hangup: I’d like to be able to contribute to the HSA but also don’t want to “lose” $750 per year reimburse in the HRA. This is where I’m hung up. This specific HRA doesn’t qualify as a high deductible plan so I can’t do both. 


Health Considerations: I’m in my early 30s, have good health, and usually spend about $200 per year in additional health costs (exception was one year I scratched a cornea and had to go to the hospital) and expect it to be similar on the new HSA plan. 

Financial Standing: I’m about $500 short of maxing out my Roth 401k and Roth IRA. I have $2500 per year budgeted for HSA contribution (old job contributed 1k) and I’m in the 22% marginal tax bracket. 

The question: Do I enroll in the HRA for the $750 reimbursement and invest the $2500 previously budgeted for the HSA in a Roth 401k and personal investment account? Or, do I enroll in the HSA and save $700 per year in state and federal income taxes and invest HSA contributions above the deductible in index funds?

personalfinance,Sister's auto loan was rejected 2 months later,"Hi PF,

My sisters old car broke down and the cost to fix it was more than the value of the car.  My sister got an auto loan for another car and bought a used reasonable car for about $8k.  She has a 830 credit score and was approved by the bank initially.  She has even made her first few payments on the loan.

The bank (a credit union) has sent a letter now telling her the loan was denied, after first approving her.  They list lack of accounts in good standing and lack of revolving credit as reported by Equifax.  The only credit card she has is a prepaid credit card through the same credit unit.  The auto loan is now the second item on her credit reports.  She has no other history.

I'm suggesting to her to get the bank to re-approve the loan, even if at a higher interest rate, and if she doesn't like the rate, search elsewhere.  I'm also suggesting she get something like a discover credit card and do 1 week of groceries on it, then pay that off in full.  This I hope gives revolving credit and history.  I'm also guessing the bank will give her time to fix the problem and that not to worry about a repo right away, but to keep paying the loan.

personalfinance,Need advice on how to handle my student loans,"Hey y'all, been a longtime lurker but my situation is finally getting to the point where I need some advice.

I have 94k in student loans (originally around 98k, been paying for a year and a half), and I've been paying the minimum payment every month ($999/month). I've just barely been scraping by after graduating, since I don't have a job in my field. I'm making roughly $16k/year at my own startup, so as you can see, the $999/month is incredibly difficult to keep up with. Not only that, but my interest each month is nearly $700, so my principal balance is hardly changing. I had a fair amount in savings that I was using for my loans, but that's pretty much dried up, so I know I need to make some sort of change to my monthly payment.

My loan is through Wells Fargo, and it's four separate private loans (one for each year I took out a loan). The individual interest rates are 9.240%V, 8.740%V, 10.240%V, 6.990%V.

I'm truly clueless when it comes to this loan stuff, but I know I have to consolidate or refinance or switch to an income-based plan, or something. I just have no idea what the best course of action is in my situation, or what most people would do. Wells Fargo keeps sending me mail with info to consolidate with them, but I'm not sure if I should be doing it through them or through a company like Earnest.

Optimally, I'd like to try to pay at least half of the monthly amount I do right now, if not less. I'm not sure what the best course of action is to achieve that, though.

Any advice you have is greatly appreciated, this loan stuff has been putting a serious damper on my mental well being.",finance

I have a pretty basic question but wanted to get your take on it...Currently I have about $38k (USD) in a conventional savings account with my bank (0.03% APY). Recently in my personal finance journey, I've been hearing more about high-yield savings accounts and am starting to feel a ""FOMO"" effect here, hence my post. What has been your experience with these?

In particular, I am mostly saving this money for a future down payment on a personal home/condo, targeting a 20-25% down payment + closing costs and related expenses (for the record, I do also contribute to my employer-matched 401k for the full 4% match, which is contributed in addition to my 8% of gross). Currently, in a typical month my cash flow into the aforementioned savings account is about $1k/month, sometimes up to about $1250-1500 in a better/""leaner-spending"" month. But recently having heard more about the high-interest savings accounts it seems like I'm missing out just parking that cash in my conventional low-interest savings account...

Currently I am debt-free, so no other major personal-finance ""blind spots"" to report. Mainly what I'm asking about here is what are some of the things to look out for with these high-interest savings accounts (besides the obvious shopping around for interest rates, and reading the fine print)? What is the general process for depositing/withdrawing to these accounts (i.e., transaction frequency limit, minimum balances, etc.)? Is there any substantial risk of *losing* money in these accounts?

My plan is to keep about $13k of the $38k in my existing (low-yield) savings account as an emergency fund/liquid reserve, and then put the rest into a high-yield savings account and also direct my current \~$1k/month cash flow into the latter to accelerate the growth of that principal.

personalfinance,Parking Money 1-5 Years,"I made a previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cxlwlw/dividends_or_sp_500_for_15_yr_withdraw/). I've done more research now. I want to park cash somewhere better than my checking account.

Right now I have 19k available and will be investing 3K additional every month for the next 1-5 years. My primary goal save money for buying an ADU. I want to preserve principle, everyting else is icing on the cake. I'm willing to accept less growth for less management. The money needs to be available for emergencies. From what I've seen the best options for safely parking ""emergency money"" are:

* High Yield Savings Account
* CD
* Treasury Bills
* Funds: VUSXX, VMMXX, VMFXX

From research I see that high yield savings accounts can provide high APY but the bank can change the APY at any time. Hence why CDs exist, which lock in the rate. With a CD you trade accessibility for higher APY. Both High yield savings accounts and CDs are subject to state and federal tax. Typically you'll get better APY from a CD than savings account. Both are fdic.

Treasury Bills to me seem like a CD. However they are not taxed by the state. You can buy treasury bills in 28-day cycles. This offers pretty good liquidity. However I want to avoid routine buying from treasurydirect. A VUSXX solves this issue. With a VUSXX fund I can liquify quicker than 28 days and do automatic reinvestment.

Are there any additional benefits to a VUSXX over buying t-bills yourself? Will VUSXX outperform a person just buying t-bills themselves? A downside of VUSXX is the 50k opening cost and 30k minimum maintenance cost (I believe it's 30k for maintenance). 

It's possible that a bank will offer better APY but it's also subject to arbitrary management decisions, where as CD, t-bills and the funds mentioned are market driven.

Based on this I'm leaning towards VMMXX or VMFXX. These two seem similarly low risk to VUSXX but not as low risk. I can always transition to VUSXX later.",finance

How does the refinance process work? Say it's a $40,000 vehicle is what we purchase for and put $30,000, does that only mean they will refiance the $10,000? Could they cut back the money we put down, or a portion of it?

Forex,The full text of the RBA statement - 3 September 2019,"At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.00 per cent.

The outlook for the global economy remains reasonable, although the risks are tilted to the downside. The trade and technology disputes are affecting international trade flows and investment as businesses scale back spending plans due to the increased uncertainty. At the same time, in most advanced economies, unemployment rates are low and wages growth has picked up, although inflation remains low. In China, the authorities have taken further steps to support the economy, while continuing to address risks in the financial system.

Global financial conditions remain accommodative. The persistent downside risks to the global economy combined with subdued inflation have led a number of central banks to reduce interest rates this year and further monetary easing is widely expected. Long-term government bond yields have declined and are at record lows in many countries, including Australia. Borrowing rates for both businesses and households are also at historically low levels. The Australian dollar is at its lowest level of recent times.

Economic growth in Australia over the first half of this year has been lower than earlier expected, with household consumption weighed down by a protracted period of low income growth and declining housing prices and turnover. Looking forward, growth in Australia is expected to strengthen gradually to be around trend over the next couple of years. The outlook is being supported by the low level of interest rates, recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, signs of stabilisation in some established housing markets and a brighter outlook for the resources sector. The main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for consumption, although a pick-up in growth in household disposable income and a stabilisation of the housing market are expected to support spending.

Employment has grown strongly over recent years and labour force participation is at a record high. The unemployment rate has, however, remained steady at 5.2 per cent over recent months. Wages growth remains subdued and there is little upward pressure at present, with strong labour demand being met by more supply. Caps on wages growth are also affecting public-sector pay outcomes across the country. A further gradual lift in wages growth would be a welcome development. Taken together, recent labour market outcomes suggest that the Australian economy can sustain lower rates of unemployment and underemployment.

Inflation pressures remain subdued and this is likely to be the case for some time yet. In both headline and underlying terms, inflation is expected to be a little under 2 per cent over 2020 and a little above 2 per cent over 2021.

There are further signs of a turnaround in established housing markets, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. In contrast, new dwelling activity has weakened. Growth in housing credit remains low. Demand for credit by investors continues to be subdued and credit conditions, especially for small and medium-sized businesses, remain tight. Mortgage rates are at record lows and there is strong competition for borrowers of high credit quality.

It is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to make progress in reducing unemployment and achieve more assured progress towards the inflation target. The Board will continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy and the achievement of the inflation target over time.",finance

### Question :   Who owns the Solar System?

###  Answer :  We do, as the whole human race.     Therefore :  We can using world wide mutual agreement, via the U.N. declare ownership of the entire Solar System, and as such, we can create a futures based security certificate (FAITH NOTE)  representing those future obtainable values in endless commodity wealth, and spend a percentage of it now, in the specific world wide effort to build up the global infrastructure to go and get it, and in the process, we can fully expand the free market, and employ the entire world in this global effort to reach the planets and then the stars, and make money doing it.   It's that simple, and the following is a long discussion of the details.

###   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###   My Fellow humans, I am running for PRESIDENT IN 2020, and what is shown here, is the proposals I offered as a would be candidate for political office in 2012, and now again in 2020.

###  A New Deal for A NEW WORLD.(To fix the problems caused by the New Deal of 1933, AND THE USE OF DEBT, fiat currency, usury based lending, and the conversion of free people into commercial corporate entities.) 1) WITHIN EACH NATION :  Establish real commodity based money again, by recognizing the commodity wealth in the ground of that nation, create FAITH NOTE certificates to represent those values, based on weight and use them to pay off the national debt entirely, and create new BACKING for real money again... i.e.. re-value the dollar(for example) , AND SO... gain the ability to take back the CENTRAL BANK OR Federal Reserve, AND NATIONALIZE IT as a non-profit part of EACH NATIONS national treasury, which is then owned by the people, AND BY LAW SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO BE OWNED BY ANY PRIVATE PARTY AGAIN.   Concerning the safe and rapid revaluation of your nations currency...            See  :  [SOVERIEGN CURRENCY CONTROL](http://caliphofgod.org/SOVEREIGN-NATIONAL-ECONOMICS/)   2) WITHIN EACH NATION :  Re-organize banking, by removing the systemic risk from bankers, and so, force bankers to lend to the people for personal needs, at zero interest, since the people own the Federal Reserve which creates the money which the banks loan out.    And to allow banks to profit still, banks can charge fees of the people, yet, can only charge interest to businesses and corporations which are not people.... and so, via debt relief, and real money again, the Federal government can produce as much currency as needed to control and regulate the economy by controlling lending, and promoting business to blossom, and all the while removing the burden of debt from the backs of the people. 

### Concerning a reorganization of the banking system, using real debt free money...       See   :    [SOVERIEGN CURRENCY CONTROL](http://caliphofgod.org/SOVEREIGN-NATIONAL-ECONOMICS/) (Business lending is where banks should make profit, AND not from lending to the people for the needs of their daily lives, as that, is debt slavery by definition.)  3) RE-ORGANIZE THE UN, into a U.N.F, United. Nations. Federation :     ... modeled on the U.S. Constitution, and demand a re-write of the UN charter to insure the sovereign freedom of the states(nations), and then re-organize the World Bank(like a non-profit Federal Reserve),and IMF(like Treasury), as non-profit parts of the UN, owned by the people of the earth, through the United Nations(BUT WHICH CAN BE INVESTED INTO WITH CLEAR LIMITS), and thus allow the UNF, to take recognized ownership of all international lands, including space and all other bodies in space, in our solar system, and then, use a similar currency creation method DESCRIBED FOR THE NATIONS ABOVE, to pay off global debt, and have almost endless investment capital to be able to contract with the businesses of the world, through fair open bidding processes, to build up the global infrastructure, so as to allow our species to expand into the solar system, and eventually the stars, and in this process, make it actually profitable and possible to end all world poverty, by employing the entire world, on massive global efforts in benefit to the entire planet.     In this way, all the major bankers and investors of the world, can invest into real world projects of long term value and make real money, instead of investing into debt currency schemes, which have enslaved our world, and serves as a form of dead weight which holds back our planets economic potential.    ---------------------------------------------------------------We need a better way to invest, and a better way to open up nations to globalization, and a way to literally end the world wide debt, simply because it is unsustainable, and Islamic Sharia is telling the world that it is a better solution, and what the people of the western nations especially the U.S.A. need to realize is that while many on TV and RADIO and even in Churches, claim that these World Bank and IMF ways are western and therefore based on Judaeo-Christian principles, they are wrong, wrong, wrong!!!    In fact Sharia Banking laws, are nothing but an extension (A copy) of Biblical laws against what is called Usury, which is to profit off of loans, by charging interest, like a loan shark, and the Old Testament makes it clear, that to charge interest to a stranger is ok, but to charge a 'brother' is a violation of God's law, and since Jesus makes it clear that all human kind are 'brothers', as one family under God, then, under God's law, Christians cannot charge interest or allow it to control their lives and economy, as it is a violation of God's law to profit in anyway off a loan to a 'brother' under god.   And nations, are simply large groups of those 'brothers'. (Exo 22:25) If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury. (Lev 25:36) Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee. (Lev 25:37) Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase. (Deu 23:19) Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury: (Deu 23:20) Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither, thou goest to possess it. (Neh 5:7) Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them. (Psa 15:5) He that putteth not out, his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never, be moved. (Pro 28:8) He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. (Eze 18:8) He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,

### (Eze 18:9) Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.

### (Eze 18:13) Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him. (Eze 18:17) That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live. (Eze 22:12) In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbors by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.

###    So the truth of the matter is, that if you are Jew or Christian or Muslim or Hindu, then you KNOW that all human kind are your 'brothers', as we are all one family under God, and as such, you are forbidden to charge interest or allow others to charge interest of you, as such is a violation of the Law of God,    WHY?  Because money is a fake thing invented by men...  to control other men.... and lending for profit.. is LOAN SHARKING and just bad (EVIL) business. And the only way to allow it, is to say that the people of earth, are not your brothers. Can you say that?As we all know, our world, is in desperate need of that 'BROTHERHOOD', and if the Christians of the west recognized this then we of the west (I live in the west) could begin to lead the world into a DEBT FREE future, and actually start to live as 'brothers', world wide.

###    The Challenge of course, is the international billionaire elite and even some nations, who are and have invested into the World Bank, IMF, and Federal Reserve for the purpose of profit, based on the payment of interest, USURY, and the only way we are going to solve the worlds problems of debt and poverty, is to give the world a better option, and do so in a way that does not destroy the value of the investments which have already been made, even as we stop the usury payments.     I.e....   we save their investment, but dont pay the profit margin.   We need a way to appease the international investors and nations, so that they can continue to hold onto their wealth (WITHOUT HAVING TO KILL THEM), and give them better ways to actually invest that wealth, which fits with the goal of globalization and expanding the free market, and securing the potential for wealth making for all those potential world investors, since we must end the profit via debt scheme, which is being used today.

###     The imposition of interest and debt to people.. IS USURY.. and is a violation of Gods law. Why does this matter?

### Because Gods law, was, and 'is' to serve as a protection for the people, from abuse by the wealthy who will enslave the world, if allowed too.

### This, either matters to you or it does not...  IF IT DOES NOT, THEN YOU ARE SCUM.   ==================================== The Modern banking system, nationally and Globally, is in violation of God's Law, because it is imposed USURY interest debt upon the entire world, in an never ending perpetual debt cycle system which is then as such, world wide debt slavery, literally. If that bothers you, then help me fix it, and end the debt forever.====================================  The following is an Executive summary of this New Deal, in three stages AS PROPOSED FOR MY OWN NATION, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, but this all can work for any nation.  Stage one :  Fix our nation, by ending the NEVER ENDING bankruptcy OF 1933, restoring real money, reducing taxes, and investing into the future with massive new investment capital with a new banking system, to fix and prevent all forms of future national debt. Stage Two :  Leverage American tax paying Corporations and Entrepreneurs, to expand across the globe, with the business benefits and protections of this New Deal for 2012-2020  policies, including reduced business interest and insured risk. Stage Three :   Leverage the U.N., to  adopt similar plans of action for organization, banking, commerce and trade, with a new currency scheme of global proportions, capable of not only paying off all world debt, but financing by providing the capital to end all world poverty by employing the world on massive new stellar expansion projects, and make money doing it.  Real money.  I.e.. get the U.N. to do all the things we as one nation cannot afford to do, BY BECOMING A U.N.F.    ..  United. Nations. Federation.   Based on a global constitution.      ==========================A more detailed summary.---------------------------------------------------------------Stage one:   American land and people potential :  Is... : Paying off the entire national debt, and ending the bankruptcy of 1933.           Revaluing the Dollar to stable Commodity based MASS values.            Buying back the Federal Reserve and making it a non-profit part of the U.S. Treasury, using and issuing only real, commodity based, debt free, interest free money.          And re-organizing the banking system to better serve the people, by offering the investors of the world, A NEW DEAL.          The idea here is very simple, by using real money which is debt free, it becomes possible for the people to control the production of Dollars, and then, can open up lending to proper standards which are much friendlier to people and to commerce, which then in turn leads to investments, projects, expansion, and growth, ALL OF WHICH would be pressured by a government run work program through the E.D.D. to create and provide jobs to all Americans, by expanding the economy with small and massive projects and infrastructure advancements, and contracting with the free market as much as possible to hire E.D.D. workers, and keep the government E.D.D. sector exactly as small as it can be, if the free market is effectively driven to maintain a strong demand for workers. This would be done, by beginning several hundred or thousands of new long term work site projects across the nation, including but not limited too, Nuclear and Solar power plants, deep mine shaft style geothermal and mineral exploration bellow every major city in the nation, and large scale diversion of percentages of the Mississippi and other rivers, into the southern states of New Mexico, Arizona and Southern California, and terra-form the entire South-West.

### FREE MARKET EXPANDING DEVELOPMENT GOALS Basically, this New Deal for 2012-2020, pays off the bankers, and in exchange the people are set free, and no longer subject to bankruptcy standards, and our sovereign nation is restored, and then, we can restore Constitutional law, real money, real property rights, and real Common Law freedom, and set about building a prosperious free land.  ---------------------------------------------------------------Stage two:   Global investment potential :         Is... :   Where it is well known that globalization is very real in todays market, and so considerable American industries are invested internationally, thus it becomes important to not only preserve those interests but to advance and expand them, but, only for, I repeat, only for, incorporations filed and paying taxes here in the U.S.A.  To U.S. based international efforts, lending would be easy and encouraged. However with this comes regulation to prevent corporations from creating shells, and offshoring their profits to middlemen corporations filed internationally to avoid taxation.   And with this, comes an international effort to pressure all other nations, and the U.N. and World Bank, and IMF, to wake up to these better policies of currency, banking, finance, and debt, and the development of true wealth.  . ---------------------------------------------------------------Stage three:   Global co-operative union of sovereign nations.       Is... :   BASICALLY, once the U.S.A. adopts these New Deal for 2012-2020 economic policies, and restores it's Constitutional republic, real money, and ends the never ending, ever increasing debt of the 80 year old bankruptcy, then, suddenly, our nation will still have to deal with the rest of the world, which we are involved with, and who are still trapped in their debt burdens, which have been established globally by the World Bank, and I.M.F... via the U.N. and the same investor based debt currency schemes....  which has placed that global debt on the backs of the people globally, and no matter how well intentioned, it would simply be impossible for the U.S.A. as one nation to solves the worlds problems, and such economic issues and global agendas of solution must be addressed at the U.N. and World Bank, I.M.F. levels. 

###    Just as Stage One, discussed, our nations debt is paid off by use of recognized ownership and long term access and use of the land mass of that nation, where the land mass wealth potential of the United States as a whole, is so vast, that the use of large scale government run, prison labor based, mining efforts to produce commodity values is so simple to develop, and so profitable in the long term, that it makes it possible to pay off all debts, and revalue all currency, and even print currency on demand based on long term futures security certificates, valued in commodities derived from our soils.  Here in Stage Three, we recognize that to solve the bigger picture of global economics, and Poverty, that it requires something more than the U.S.A. can do alone, and would require a new co-operative union of nations, to work together on very agreeable long term mutual goals of, long term profitable mutual benefit, and luckily for the world today, we have the foundation for such an economic union, which we know of as the U.N., which as part of this New Deal for 2012-2020, would re-organize itself into a U.N.F....   United Nations Federation, of Sovereign free nations, exactly like the founding fathers did with the states, and granting the Federal government, limited powers to regulate commerce, and print and produce real debt free money, and settle for disputes, HENCE THE NEED FOR A GLOBAL CONSTITUTION.     Therefore, as President, I would dedicate myself to pressuring the U.N. and all nations of this world to adopt these New Deal for 2012-2020 policies.  Basically, we form a union of world nations, and as such, under contract agreement, agree to declare ownership of the entire solar system, then, we can as a planet via the U.N.F. declare the WORLD BANK, a non-profit org run by the UN, and convert the IMF into the  I.M.Treasury, which is also a non-profit run by the UN,  which can then create a futures based security certificate, based on those future obtainable values in the solar system.  And the value of these new security certificates, is based on our faith in our worlds work potential to go and get it over time(credit rating), and the legally binding assurance of law dictating that U.N.F. government must work to do exactly that by running massive mining efforts.....   in this case...   globally, internationally, such as Antartica, and the bottom of the Oceans, and .. most importantly, internationally, in space, such as on the Moon, Mars, Venus, and the Asteriod Belt.  It being easily understood that the potential long term wealth to be obtained from long term efforts in mining the resources of the solar system, is so huge, as to dwarf any of the costs today and over the next 100-500 years, meaning literally, that we can employ the entire world to build up the infrastructure of our planet to not only handle it's own population growth, but honestly, realistically, develop the means to launch our people literally amoungst the planets and then the stars.  And not only does the effort pay for itself, but the reward is on the whole found by providing the long term assurance of our peoples survival even if our world is destroyed.     Which can happen...  IT CAN HAPPEN AT ANY TIME...   IF WE ARE SLOW...   WE DIE.   Stage Three, would literally be, where I as President pressure and compell the nations of the world, via the U.N...  to adopt these new currency policies, and use them to end all world wide debt, end all bankruptcies, and allow nations to begin to prosper accordingly, and allow global investors to invest into real things, real businesses and real projects, instead of just investing into debt currency and lending schemes.  In this way, we can end all world poverty, by allowing the U.N.F. via the World Bank, to lend to nations with zero interest, and to corporations with extremely low interest and so also contract with  international corporations, to get the job done, which is employing the world in building up the global infrastructure and industry to rapidly expand into the seas, Antartica, and then Space itself, with a focus on the Moon in order to develop long term efforts to the Asteriod belt.       It is where our entire planet joins in union, and adopts for itself a serious and deliberate market goal, which is two fold, the first is interplanetary expansion, and gaining access to the wealth of the Asteriod belt, and the second, is establishing and developing the technology and the means and confidence to literally lauch our people by the millions across the galaxy to other stars and planets, the rewards for which are not measurable in Dollars... unless.. and until regular trade routes are established between stars, which could be a very long time, if ever. The simple fact of the matter is, it would be profitable for our world to employ its people on a large scale to launch and fully take over this solar system, and in doing so, the resources gained over time, can more than pay for the long term debt of doing so...........  These New Deal for 2012-2020  plans, describe a simple means of actually ending all debt, and in doing so, we end all world poverty, and make money doing it. I say, it is a good deal.  -Mosheh Eesho Muhammad",finance

worldpolitics,Tourism and the chances for Armenian economic miracle,"The national economy of Armenia is supposed to grow at a rate of 5% per year. The economic revolution is now a top priority for the leadership of the republic. However, there is a long difficult way from a political democratic miracle to an economic miracle. It is expected that the main sources of future growth will be diaspora remittances and state investments in infrastructure. Growth due to new private business projects is postponed to a later period.

The service sector accounts for more than half of GDP. This is due to the high level of development of the tourism industry. Currently, a number of large-scale programs are being implemented, including a $3 million agro-tourism development project covering 60 settlements, and a more than 5 million rural support project in the north of the republic. Their financing is provided by the Russian government.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, since 2016 Integrated Rural Tourism Development project has been realizing contributing to equal territorial development. Its implementation is funded by the Russian Federation-UNDP Trust Fund for Development (UNDP). Within the framework of the project, walking trails were developed, community and decentralized hotels, theme parks, centers for scientific and adventure tourism, tourist research and resource centers, artifact collection museums, pottery workshops, cheese cellars, mini-wineries, carpet heritage museum, workshop were founded for the production of cross stones - stone steles with a carved image of a cross, an art studio where tourists can make paper with their own hands and engage in its artistic embossing.

An important component of the rural tourism development project is the gastro yard. They are founded by villagers in their homes. These are authentic cultural centers that allow tourists not only to taste local cuisine typical of a particular region, but also to communicate with residents, get acquainted with their culture, way of life, and traditions.

UNDP project coordinator Arman Valesyan believes that such initiatives help develop small businesses in the villages. ""Within the framework of the project, we not only help to establish and expand our business, but also work in the area of ​​sales and marketing,"" he told reporters. The embassy of the Russian Federation in Armenia takes an active part in the opening of new tourist sites within the framework of the program. The diplomatic mission is confident that the project funded by Russia will further strengthen the strategic partnership between the countries, develop the tourism industry in Armenia, create new jobs and improve the welfare of the population. Particular emphasis is placed on rural development.

In general, thanks to internal consolidation of efforts and external support, an economic miracle is possible in Armenia. There are all necessary resources for its accomplishment, but their competent distribution is very important.",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

My interest rate on the card is 20%. What I dont understand is how interest on a credit card works? Does it only apply interest to my balance at the end of the month or does it charge interest on everything I swipe? 
I usually swipe about $800-1000a month (I use my card for everything) and then pay off all of it but about $100 every month. Someone told me about a 10% utilization at the end of the month would increase my credit score. Is this correct? Is it bad to swipe a lot a month and then pay it all off at the end of the month? Should I just use my debit card for all my transactions since I'm paying all my credit card off each month anyway?

personalfinance,"Refinancing Student Loan, Should I?","Ok, I have never refinanced anything. So I’m looking for advice and/or comments on things that I might not know. My situation is the following:

44k Student Loan at a 7% interest rate over a 10 year spread. My first payment is next week. I have enough income to make the payment and possibly double to pay off the principal quicker. Still this will take around 4 to 5 years to pay the loan in full. I would be paying that 7% interest rate for those 5 years. 

Question is the following:

If I refinance soon lets say in about a month or two for a 10 year spread and a lower interest rate (if i can find it) Let’s say 4%, I would be paying the loan maybe even quicker because I would be assigning more money to the principal and 4% interest on 44k for 4 years is a lot saved.

What am I missing? Is refinancing hard or difficult? Does it affect my credit a lot to ask for inquiries? I have found a couple of banks that say they will refinance for as low as 2.45% (I don’t have the credit for that I guess, I’m steady at 683) Might get a bump soon as I got credit increases coming up. Hit me with the details.

I know how to calculate how much I'll owe in the future, bit I don't know what's a normal interest rate would be for someone in my situation. Sorry for the blabber

TL;DR: help me not get ripped off by telling me whats normal for interest rate.

CryptoCurrency,How many people are aware of money transmitter and money services business laws?,"I was reading the comments of the following post and I was reminded that most people (including in crypto) are unaware of the money transmitter laws and Money Services Business (MSB) laws of the U.S:

https://np.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/cyw9cf/tried_to_send_my_roommate_half_of_rent_venmo_did/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

What are these laws, exactly? They are the laws that tell businesses (such as exchanges and other websites) to “know your customer” (KYC). As well, they require them to set up the infrastructure and processes to fulfill anti-money-laundering (AML) requirements. These can be extremely costly (not something your garage startup can handle) and detrimental to user friendliness (say “cheese” as you take your selfie while holding up your ID).

So, want to create any innovative site that uses crypto but which you must at some point hold crypto provided by a user? You’re going to have a difficult time. That’s why you find few crypto based sites that you’d think would have been made by now (like a crypto-based Patreon... or a site where users could anonymously buy and sell crypto using stripe or square or something...or anything else you can imagine).

Can others attest to what I’m saying? 

I’d like to see more awareness of money transmitter and similar laws in the crypto space. Because they’re a big reason, in my mind, for lack of fiat on-ramps, lack of innovative crypto businesses/sites, and subsequently, lack of adoption by the general public. I wish there was more discussion of how entrepreneurs can go about so they are not hindered by them (while still respecting the spirit of anti-money-laundering).

I haven’t even brought up the fact that individual states have their money transmitter laws that may add on to requirements already made at the Federal level.

**TLDR:** money transmitter and other financial anti-money-laundering laws are a big part of why innovative crypto based websites and businesses aren’t being made and a big reason for the lack of user friendliness that could lead to more adoption of crypto use (better say “cheese” before you can buy any crypto...definitely can’t be easy like buying with PayPal). How can entrepreneurs overcome this obstacle while respecting the law?",cryptocurrency

Spent the past two days building a projection model to pay-off my immediate debts in the ""what if I got hired full-time"" scenario.   


All my credit lines are asking me to update my income for over a month. Should I even bother updating it since there is a possible risk that I won't get the position 3 months from now? If I don't update then there's no changes. However, if I do update, I can reap the benefit of a possible credit boost to lower my utilization rate hence increasing my battered credit score. Increasing my credit score now could help me in the near future once I'm financially justified to purchase a car with a car loan at a lower interest rate.  


Personally, I think I should act now as if I have the job and set myself up for future action. Still, I do have a plan if I don't keep the position which is to start applying to other jobs after a month to insure myself. Is this a good way to look at this case?

personalfinance,Reduce Debt/Monthly Commitments OR Increase Retirement/Investment Savings?,"I received some really solid advice here earlier this summer, so I’m hoping to tap the collective expertise for another decision I’m mulling.

My husband and I have two somewhat conflicting short-term financial goals:

* Reduce monthly financial commitments to increase stability and flexibility.
* Amp up our retirement savings and investments.

With that in mind, we are currently debating whether to take $7K from our savings to pay off my car two years early. The loan rate is 3.39% and the monthly payment is $282.38. If we pay the loan on schedule, we’d pay a total of $7,341.88. Of that, about $300 is interest.

Regardless of what we do, both my 401K and my husband’s IRA will be maxed out by the end of the year. We also have a 6-month emergency fund and $11K in a high-yield savings account for travel, unexpected expenses, etc. (this is where the car $ would come from). I’m also a faithful YNAB user, so I feel I have a good handle on our true expenses.

Which would be the most financially prudent?

1. Keep the $7K in our savings (Keep that cash! You never know what terrible things can happen!)
2. Invest the $7K in either an IRA in my name or an investment account (Make that money work for you! Your car interest rate is low any way!)
3. Use the $7K to pay off the car and start putting that $280 to extra mortgage principal or into an investment account (Dave Ramsey would be so proud! Snowball, baby!)

I never know how much detail to include, so if it helps, I’ve included more context below:

**INCOME:**

I am a salaried employee and bring home $4,800 each month (after 401K, health insurance, other benefits and taxes). I also receive an annual bonus in February of around $10K but we don’t factor that into our budgeting planning. When it comes, we put it straight into savings, retirement, or extra loan principal.

My husband owns his own business and his average monthly “paycheck” is $2K, but it varies widely based on volume of work and client billing cycles.

**BUDGET:**

Our average monthly net income is $6,800 and our living expenses average $4,400.

Depending on my husband’s workload and the time of year, we’ll loosen things up so our expenses increase to $4,400-$5,400. This leaves between $1,400-2,400 for savings each month.

**SAVINGS &amp; RETIREMENT:**

We have a $20K emergency fund (covers 6-months of barebones expenses) and an additional $17K in our high-yield savings account.

We are a little behind on our retirement (up until recently, I was contributing only 8% to my 401K and my husband did not have any retirement savings). I now max out my 401K (19% of my salary = $19K) and we are about to put $6K into his new IRA. That still leaves about $10K in liquid savings to work with.

**OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:**

We recently paid off our two higher interest loans (car and student loans that were greater than 5%) which took $8K from our savings but eliminated paying interest and frees up $400/month.

Outside of the car currently in question, our only debt is our mortgage. We just bought a new house ($330K value, $275K loan with a 4.375% rate). PMI is $38 and drops off in 2 years. We hope to regularly put additional funds to the principal and eventually refinance.

We also hope to have kids within 1-2 years, which will bring a host of new expenses like childcare, medical, etc.

Its a 30 year fixed. When we first got the mortgage the monthy payment was $552 a month. Every year I get a shortage notice and now its up to $672 a month. My homeowners insurance premium hasnt change. The city I live in has passed a levi but it was only supposed to effect my escrow roughly $20.00 a month. I suppose I could cut the lender a check for the shortage amount but honestly im getting aggrivated with the shortages every year. They sent me a letter saying that my escrow account shouldnt go below 492.00 and it has so they tweaked my escrow to cover it. My escrow has never gone negative though. Ultimatley I know its wiser to have a shorter term, lower interest mortgage. I was holding off on refinancing because I might have a hefty inheritance coming and didnt want to pay to refinance.

personalfinance,"Girlfriend got a car payment she can't handle. Would ""down-trading"" the car and rolling payments into a new loan be the best option, despite that generally being a bad idea?","Hey guys, okay long story short, my girlfriend has a car payment she just can't handle. She is younger (23) and simply put, made a poor financial decision. 

It's a 2016 Fiat 500x with 55k miles. Here are the details.

Financed everything for 20k at 12.5% interest over 72 months. If she keeps everything as is, she will pay around 30k when it is all said and done.

More details:

- Current payoff amount on loan $19k
- Original cost of car -$15,500
- Cost of fees, state tax, and some BS extra warranty - 5k

Current trade in value of car 11k to 12k

Private sale value - Around 14k

Her monthly payment is around $450,  and this being a somewhat newer car, and the fact she was in a wreck a year ago, here insurance is $220.

She does not make a lot of money, like 21k per year.

At the current moment, getting a higher paying job, or getting a side job to pay down the current loan isn't realistic, so we are working within what she makes now.

EDIT: To clarify this, she works a full time job, is in school, is currently ""unskilled,"" and has a few other issues complicating a move to a new job (for the next 5 months at least).

I'm trying to help her figure out a way to ease the financial burden as the monthly payment is simply killing her. The best option seems to be something that is often advised against and that is as follows:

- Go to the dealer, and downtrade to like a 5k car (let's say trade in value is 12k). Take the extra 7k and apply that to 19k owed... she now has a 12k loan, possibly less if I can get them to drop that extra warranty they sold her. So yeah, she still has a car payment, and owes a significant amount of money, despite have a lesser car... but... the monthly car payments and insurance would be far less. (I've also taken into account possible costs of repairs etc for 5k car).

I'm aware of the negatives associated with doing something like this... however... the monthly payment is what is really killing her.

The other possible option is seeing if she can somehow refinance as the sole loan holder - what makes this especially complicated is the car is actually under her father's name (who had no credit) and she was the co-signer (her credit is like 680). I have a suspicion her dad was using this as an opportunity to build credit for himself, and that she likely would have gotten a better deal had she been the primary.

After I brought all this up to her. He says he will sign whatever paperwork he needs to sign.

What do you guys think?

FINAL EDIT: After having a discussion with her tonight about this, I asked if I could look at her credit report (via credit karma).

Turns out that based on her current credit of 680 she may be able to refinance the car down to an 8% interest rate (same time frame), which lowers the payment by about $100. In addition, I found out she is overpaying for insurance, and a switch to larger company like progressive would also save her about $100 a month.

Finally, turns out her mom opened a credit card in her name awhile back (her parents are something else I'm telling you) and the balance is only like $300. I believe paying this off might push her into the 700s from a credit standpoint, which could potentially mean an even better deal in terms of refinancing the car.

I just have to figure out how having the dad as the primary on the original loan works with all this.",finance
financialindependence,Environmentalism and FIRE,"Lately our family has been considering installing a residential solar system to cover most of our home electricity needs, and it got me thinking about the relationship between being financially responsible and environmentally responsible.  [After buying a Chevy Volt and adding 1,000 square feet to our house](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b44qvp/four_year_update/), we suddenly find ourselves paying a lot more in electricity than we were before, and then realized that we could both lower that bill and significantly reduce our carbon footprint by going solar.

Back of the envelope calculations: current cost to install solar is \~$3.00/watt, so 10kW system would be $30k.  The 30% ITC tax credit reduces initial cost to $21k.  Payback period given average production of a 10kW system with \~$.11/kW utility pricing is \~**12 years**; your mileage may vary depending on your location and local tax incentives.

Over 30 years, such a system would produce \~$50k of power, or about **$30k** net after installation costs.  If you have to finance it (we're considering a cash out refinance on our mortgage), then given today's low interest rates, basically cut that in half.  Admittedly, those returns over 30 years are...well, better than wasting it on avocado toast, but obviously nothing compared to an index fund.  You should still invest in both tax advantaged and taxable accounts to build up a nest egg - but I think it's worth considering (especially for privileged folks like us) a few little projects like this that can both save  a little money and help mitigate the effects of climate change.

Of course, some people take this too far, in my opinion, to the point of sacrificing their financial security in order to be on the bleeding edge of environmental tech.  I've got friends with multiple Teslas and solar installations in houses they don't live in for the long-term; I admire their principles because they view climate change as a bigger threat than their pocketbook, but I just personally can't help but try to make some kind of financial sense out of the decisions I make.

personalfinance,Can I afford a dog? (21 year old graduate student in MCOL city),"Hi y’all,

I’m preparing to get a dog with my partner later this week. I’m afraid that I am letting my heart speak a little too loud, and so I’m here for a reality check. I am using a throw-away to keep my information private. 

My partner and I are currently students; I am in my first year of a two-year masters program and my partner has a year left of undergraduate studies, after which he may go on to a graduate program as well. After graduation, I will either go straight into a Ph.D. or work for a year or two once graduating. I have no idea what my income will be if I did decide to work, but it would probably be $50k-$60k a year.

Let’s get down to it:

**Income -** 

I make $9.50/hr plus commission and bonuses; the work is somewhat seasonal. I average about $17-22 an hour, working mainly weekends. 

My projected income this year, after taxes, is $15,000. I expect a refund of about $1000 (I just submitted a new withholdings form, but even then I expect a large refund).

I work 2-3 days a week during the school year and 4-5 days a week during breaks. The amount I make is not scalable (i.e. working during the week makes me less than the weekend) so any extra shifts I pick up would be at about $12/hour. Picking up more shifts is no problem; we are constantly short-staffed. I could probably be approved for massive overtime during the breaks, but the work is exhausting and I don't think I could handle it. 

**Savings -** 

After paying my tuition/fees (\~$2500/semester) and rent this month, I have $13,000 in cash on hand. I also have approximately $4,000 in bonds that I have yet to cash, and they all mature in about 20 years. They do not do much better than a high-yield savings account, so I essentially count them as savings. 

Savings are only used for emergency expenses and tuition payments. 

**Expenses-**

***Split:***

$855 in rent

$48 for internet (cheapest plan in my area)

$75-100 in electricity (will go down in the winter)

\~$100 in other utilities/fees (charged by the apartment complex, out of my control)

$15 renter’s insurance (again, cheapest)

\~$300-400 in groceries/household items

\~$60 for gas

$147 car payment (leased; please do not lecture me on this as I got it with certain circumstances in mind, and I absolutely made the correct decision. I have 2.5 years left.)

***Individual:***

$30 for bus fare (I use the bus for school as it is a 10 min ride and parking is outrageous)

I budget about $100 for going out/hobbies/etc. but I often do not use it. I am a bit of a homebody. 

**Other Pertinent Information:**

My parents pay for my car insurance, phone bill, and health insurance. They will continue to do so until I am at least done with my masters. It is likely that afterwards I will stay on their plans and reimburse them a certain amount each month. 

I HAVE NO DEBT, STUDENT OR OTHERWISE. I do have a Discover It card that is used only for gas and it set up on full, monthly automatic payments. I do not plan on going into debt for my master’s at this time, but I realize my situation may change.

My partner currently works part-time but pays all of his expenses out of a 529 plan. I do not know exactly what his situation is, but I have been reassured that there is “more than enough money” to get him through graduate school by him and his immediate family members. He has no debt as well. 

**Future Dog Expenses:** ***(split)***

$20 in pet rent, plus food and other expenses (which I imagine will be about $50-120/month)

Adoption fees would be $200, with $150 non-refundable deposit and a $150 refundable deposit (neither of which I will plan on getting back). 

I am looking at pet insurance ($22-60/month depending on the coverage). Everyone tells me not to, but I am worried about surprises. I think it would be worth an extra shift a month to me. 

So. Can I afford a dog? I do not plan on moving within the next 5 years, or traveling. I struggle greatly with anxiety, and I think having one around will help tremendously, especially as I spend the majority of my week home alone.",finance

personalfinance,"Bouncing back -- PLSF, self-education?","So I earned a bachelor's degree way back in 2003 in Information Systems. I wasn't particularly interested with the field, but it seemed like a good way to provide for my family. I also felt like I needed to stop changing my major and just graduate with something.


Due to life choices/circumstances, I have not worked in that field since 2006. The last job I had in that field (as a contractor) paid $15/hr. I've been told that my degree is basically useless now without being updated. (I don't feel like it gave me many useful skills to begin with, just a broad overview, but that's beside the point.) I am in my 40s now, and my student loan balance has increased to $65k. I am in year 2 of an IBR plan after coming out of default.


After a period of odd jobs, I'm currently back to working in a restaurant for $10/hr. I can't afford my bills, although my monthly student loan payments stand at $0 for now due to my low income. I can't afford health insurance through my job, so I currently rely on Medicaid for chronic health issues (not enough for disability). 


I have been applying at local companies, but the only jobs that seem open to me are receptionist/low-level work at $10-14/hr. My area has a low COL, but jobs tend to pay lower than the national average. I could probably live on $14/hr though.


I've been looking at either:

1. getting a hospital job that wouldn't require more education, just on-the-job training. I have a good reference who tells me they will start their lowest paid workers at $15 starting next year. I believe the particular job I was looking at would pay about $18/hr to start. Plus there would be benefits and the possibility of the PSLF program to help pay off my loans. It looks like kind of a monotonous job, but 10 years to pay off a loan looks a lot more doable than 23 (and a big tax bill at the end) at this point. If I like my coworkers, I could probably do it.


2. getting a local government job, although I think these are hard to come by around here. Wages look like about $10-14 here, but with decent benefits and PSLF again. Also the possibility of moving up or laterally?


3. getting in at a company in an interesting industry at a low level and trying to work up to something more technical/higher pay. No PSLF, but a possibility of higher pay eventually(?)


Meanwhile, I'd be taking time outside of work to address my health issues. I'd also be trying to get new skills on my own or cheaply. If I was in the PSLF, I would have 10 years to develop something before probably moving on (unless I love my job so much at that point.) 


Possibilities I'm thinking of (this is where I start to get excited about life again) include:

--web development (maybe web design too) or data analysis self-study, maybe single Udemy courses

--UI/UX

--technical writing?

--GIS -- very interested, but probably not if it requires a Master's

--I'm interested in design and illustration (technical illustration too?) but wary of trying to make a career in it. But I was thinking of taking a years' worth of drafting classes in the evening at a local center for a total cost of $1600 (4 classes). I know most places prefer drafters to have an Associate's, but I can't afford that without financial aid.


I'm also interested in Library Science, but just thinking a big ""no"" to getting an advanced degree in that for more debt at my age. 


Also, I love the idea of working from home or just having a great deal of independence, which is one of the appeals of something like web development. I realize that freedom is an ideal though and probably shouldn't take priority in my job search.

**Background**  
I have **82,478.94** in student loan debt, interest rates ranging from 3.15% to 7.90%. My **annual income** (pretax of course) is **88k** as a software engineer.

**Current savings**  
Currently I have about 20k in my checking/savings, with no 401k and no roth IRA started.

**Extra help**  
My girlfriend has been helping me immensely with rent and my loan payments. She's been a major supporter of paying down my debt.

**Ideal plan**  
I want to save up more and buy some rental property as a way to get into home ownership and also making money passively. I have a few friends who have already been buying duplexes/triplexes and renting them out, but I haven't been able to since I've been paying down my debt (started with 105k). 

**Previous Plan**  
My plan up until now was to pay off my loans ASAP within the next few years, investing only into my 401k.

**Current Plan**  
I'm planning on getting my employer match on my 401k and dumping 6k into my roth IRA, paying the minimum on my loans, and putting the rest into index funds.

**I'm asking for your help**  
Are you going through a similar experience, or know someone who would be able to advise on this situation? If so, please comment below, I would love to hear your opinion.

Bitcoin,Not enough posts about why Bitcoin is better,"I've been a part of this sub as well as lurked on a number of other crypto subs and noticed that a very high percentage of posts on other subs are about why their coin is better than Bitcoin.

As someone who once was new to the crypto space, but only in the Era of the existance of thousands of shitcoins in addition to BTC, I can say that it's easy to get caught up in the rhetoric of 'My coin is better because it works better as a currency'.

Newbies fall for this quickly because they think cryptocurrency is all about free, instant transactions, and that must have been what made Bitcoin popular in the first place.

Everyone who has been here a while knows that's bullshit, and that's because the reason why Bitcoin is rising in price and popularity is due primarily to its massive hashpower ensuring an unchangeable deflationary monetary policy outside government control. This hashpower increases decentralization because more people can run lightweight nodes due to small blocks. The same CAN NOT be said for ANY other crypto.

I think these core features of Bitcoin alone need to be brought up with more frequency in this sub, because it is all too easy for people to get the wrong idea about what made cryptocurrency so groundbreaking in the first place.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,purchase from unknown vendors,"**Conor got a call from his bank asking if he had recently  used his meal entertainment card to purchase food from multiple local tenders. His bank had noticed an unusual transactions on his account.**

Conor had not bought any of these purchases and was quite confused. Typically, what happens is when a purchase is made from a shared company ATM, the purchase comes under a different franchine name. For instance, in Conor's case, he purchased a meal from Bella Vista Takeaway, and the purchase was recorded under Hunnaway Takeaway Online 2463. HT2463 is the largest business in Connor's local area. When the track was confirmed, it was shown that what typically happens with such widely distributed cards, is that purchase names are lost, particularly if a single company owns multiple fast food chains. Chinese diners, takeaway houses and fast-food outlets normally use bigger company ATMs, which is why they are recorded under such. Do not be afraid if you see this. Just double check that you in fact ate out during the day in which the money was taken or 2 days prior (some ATM's take a few buisness days to process your payments). Also, if you have purchased a large sum of food (approximately $76 worth), some ATMS take out the balance within 2-3 seperate transactions, showing up on your balance as $24, $52, $4. 

So, do not be worried. Contact your bank to make sure your purchases are legible. If so, look at the terms and conditions of your meal entertainment card (it typically explains the information above in more complex words). 

However, do not be embarrassed to report a scam or double checking, by doing so you will make it more difficult for fraudsters to deceive someone else.

* Always ensure website is secure e.g. https is the universal understanding of a secure website – the S in https means secure!
* Always log on to a website directly rather than clicking on links provided in an email.
* Always double check with the bank

Are meal entertainment cards worth it? Honestly, no. Look below for @snowants experience: 

I used to work for NSW Health, and most people were on this FBT thing... I still don't understand it, but quite a large whack of my salary went into the Westpac ""Employee Benefits"" debit card, which could only be used for purchases, not for cash. It meant that you got something like an extra $16,000 pa into your pay.

In addition, there was the ""meal entertainment"" thing, which also fed money back to the department. If you had a meal with 3 or more people, you kept the receipt, and when it was up to $300, sent it in to the finance people. I thought we just got our tax back but nope, got the entire $300 back!

I later on worked for a health sector non-profit organisation, and they were on the $16,000 thing, but they used it to beef up our pays to the normal rate, and you had to prove you'd used that portion of your pay for mortgages and bills and things at the end of each financial year, which was quite tricky.

I work for another health non-profit now, that isn't on any of this. Does anyone know what are the perameters for an employer to qualify for this rort um I mean incentive?",finance

cybersecurity,What Is An ICO? Understanding The Good And Bad,"The advertising methodology for ICOs has been changing ever since the term was coined. An ICO, or Initial Coin Offering, is a route for new businesses to crowdfund capital by selling their own token in return for essentially Bitcoin or Ethereum. While ICOs are not client confronting, they make it amazingly simple for any organization/association to raise capital for their organizations. In other words, it's a middleware layer which accelerated the advent of new ICO startups and pulled in new capital to its substantial extent. Due to their rapid growth and novelty, ICOs come in many flavors depending on the underlying product/business, the capital raise/token sale process, and legislation/regulatory context.   


However, in spite of the incredible advantages that ICOs are bringing into the market, there are also, unfortunately, numerous ways this new procedure is being debased and abused. The blockchain and cryptocurrency space are infamous for its cons and ways to avoid regulations. Just for example, the newest joke among entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley is that ICOs mean free money. Thousands of entrepreneurs now want to do an ICO to raise huge sums of money that no sane venture capitalist or institutional investor would invest in.   


There are so much more to be exact, and all of these issues are constantly eroding the confidence in the system. Still, despite all of the problems that many have outlined, the massive valuations from that give little room for hiccups or setbacks. As stated in [KuCoin's article](https://blog.kucoin.com/how-to-identify-a-scam-in-crypto-sk-rd), ICOs’ strengths could mean a future where crowdfunding displaces venture capital and institutional funding as the main medium of raising money for start-ups, IF their structural problems are fixed. In the end, it's important enough that any crypto investors have done their thorough research, self-education and healthy caution, because likely these are the greatest tools to solve the Good and Bad of ICOs.",technology

personalfinance,"Long Post - Down Payment, Student Loan Debt, Paying School in Cash??","This is going to be a bit lengthy and I'm sorry for that, I just want to explain everything thoroughly so that I can get the best advice/insight possible.

Here's the situation: I currently have $24k in student loan debt (master's program only), I am actively completing my master's program and then will continue for my doctorate.  My loans are through are federal through the gov't and the percentages on them are 6.6% and 6%. I graduate with my MSN in May 2020 and then will be eligible to sit for my nurse practitioner boards which will in turn double my income starting maybe August 2020 once I start working?? I decided to take out student loans because I was worried about not being able to work and pay for schooling at the same time but I've actually been able to work more than I thought I could. Currently at this time I'm saving a minimal amount to try and reduce how much money I have to take out in loans to finish my schooling but currently the plan is student loans for the majority of the payment.

Next topic, my husband and I have been working on paying off his car loan which only has $7.5k remaining, we are on track to pay that off by the end of November.  The Auto loan percentage is 2.75%. (if we keep doing things the way we are)

Lastly, we are building a house that is set to be completed in June 2020 - I have a feeling it will be more like August 2020 due to permits and building in the winter.  Our loan agent is advising us that if a down payment of 10% is going to have the most impact to our interest rate versus what I told him was that we are likely going to be able to save 7-8%. We are planning on paying our PMI upfront which will be around $10k. We are building the house with a builder and currently are pre-approved for a loan but do not know the final interest rate until sometime next year about two months before closing. Total house cost is $534k.

Currently at this point in time, we are able to meet 90% of our living expenses with my husband's income. So my income is supplemental/debt payment. I work PRN at the hospital so I can work as much or as little as I like. During breaks I work a lot of overtime but when school's in session I generally pull in about 24 hours/week. My husband's income is $80k/yearly and my salary is variable due to me being an hourly employee. I make $34.50/hr and generally work 24 hours/week so take home biweekly is generally $2200-2400.

We don't have any kids, it's just us. No big expenses coming up. I have a good emergency fund and actively budget using YNAB so I'm prepared for random auto/medical expenses that come up as well. 

So my question for you all is: What is the best way I can make our money work for us and what is going to be most beneficial to us in the long run?

\-After we pay off the car loan should we give it our all and try to meet 10% for the down payment and save the student loans for after I get my new job?

\-Should we get to 5% down and then focus on paying off my student loan debt and preventing more debt by paying for school in cash?

OR something else all together???

personalfinance,Student loan payoff strategy,"Amongst many other student loans, my two of highest interest are:

A: balance approximately $1,200, interest rate 6.8%.   loan ""paid ahead"" quite a few months as I've been working on paying it off.

B: balance approximately $3,400, interest rate 6.0%.

Now, I will have $1,000 in a few days to apply to either of these loans. Usually, along with my usual payment, I only have an extra $50 or so each month to pay extra on a loan, so this is a big deal.

It occured to me the other day that maybe I should have started focusing on my lower interest loan (Loan B) some time ago as its higher balance may actually be generating more interest than Loan A.

I'm not good at figuring out the maths behind this, but what is your advice? What would you do?

Pay off Loan A (almost) and be done with it then start paying off Loan B?  

Take a big chunk out of Loan B and pay it down for a bit then go back and pay off Loan A?

personalfinance,Wife ran up secret 5000 on our emergency card,"So now I have to deal with it. What I want to do is cancel the card entirely, pay it off and never give her access to credit again (this is the 3rd or 4th time something like this has happened). 

Regardless, I have a 760 FICO score according to my credit union, but they only offered me 14% on an unsecured loan of 4000 (I have $1000 saved I was going to pay the difference with). I have a good history with my credit card and they dropped my interest rate from 14.6% to 11.6% just because I asked. Balance transfer is an option. The current card has 10.9% interest, but it's through her bank which I don't normally access (they don't set those up so two people can have separate accounts that access the same information).

I suppose the smartest thing to do would be to just make payments on the balance,  but leave it on the current card considering the interest rate is lowest, but I don't want any chance of more charges on that card. I asked them to cancel it and they're waiting for my confirmation, but I wanted to ask first in case there are consequences I can't see.

personalfinance,When does it makes sense to Refinance?,"We purchased our first home back in January, with a 30-year loan of $335k @ 4.375%. About $332k remains. We put 12% down, so there is some PMI currently ($53/month). Since then, rates have dropped, and I'm seeing we could get either a 30-year @ 3.625% or 15-year @ 3.125%.

My question is, when does it make sense to refinance? I estimate our home to be worth about $420k (we bought it as-is off-market and got a deal on it), so a new appraisal would almost certainly eliminate PMI. I would really love to be rid of Escrow too (required on loans with &gt;80% LTV), we had to prepay a year's worth of insurance and that just strikes me as stupid. Cost to refi would probably be about $3k. I would lean toward a 30-year at these rate spreads, which would lower the payment and hopefully eliminate PMI and escrow. I know there is talk of the Fed lowering rates again, so perhaps it makes sense to wait and watch for a few months.

- 9,700 at 10% = 970.00
- 29,775 at 12% = 3,573.00
- 4,250.43 at 22% = 935.09 (43,725.43 - 39,475.00)

- Job A Federal Withholding YTD: 2,647.69
- Job B Federal Withholding YTD: 1,867.68

That comes to 4,515.37 meaning I am 962.72 short in taxes (notionally). Now I can correct this without issue (as my taxes changed during the year due to divorce and so earlier I was withholding less due to different schedules), but I want to ensure I at least ran these numbers correctly or not.

defi,Who's actually *borrowing* on DeFi applications?,"Hey guys,  


Absolutely love all the progress I'm seeing in the DeFi sector as a whole recently. The UI/UX's look fantastic and it's great to see new assets being supported every day.  


My biggest question is who is actually \*borrowing\* stablecoins like USDC or DAI at such high interest rates?  What use-cases (games like Axie, margin via dYdX, etc.) actually present high enough profit or livelihood opportunities that borrowing becomes more advantageous than whatever capital you can commit to these strategies from your own disposable income?  


As a small aside, is this any different from taking out a large amount of credit debt when you don't have enough funds in a checking or savings account to cover it at any time?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Thoughts on Stock Sale Vs. Car Loan,"Hello, I currently own 170 shares of my companies stock purchased through our employee stock purchas plan over the last 3 years in $100 increments. I was considering selling this stock and using the proceeds to buy my daughter a car for her 16th birthday. My hesitation stems from trying to understand the tax implications as the stock was purchased with after tax income, and is not in an IRA or any other retirement account. How would I go about figuring out what I would pay in taxes on the sale? If the taxes are higher than the interest rate on a car loan, I would rather just get a loan for the car.

My interest rate landed on 8.99% due to the age of the car, but my credit is bulletproof.

However, I see that autopay loans refinance a car up to 11 years old. Their website is incredibly frustrating, as it gave me an error when looking for quotes. However they sent me a pretty ambiguous email excited over all the savings they are going to provide for me if I call.

12 years later things are quite different. I'm almost done in my 4th block of nursing school and graduating from an associates program in 3 months with my ADN. I just enrolled in a bridge program to obtain my BSN (bachelors science in nursing) that would start in October as a concurrent enrollment. 

They require an official transcript from UoP. My ADN never needing this and I didn't bother requesting it since the class I took was a nonsense 'group teamwork' 101 or some crap. 

UoP told me I owe them $790 if I want the transcript. That they would 'work with me' but turned down my lowball offer of giving them $50 for a transcript. The appeal process for this is 30 days and I need to enroll in classes. 

What can I offer them to settle this? It's been 12 years and I've never even had this show on my credit report when I applied for a mortgage? My score is like almost perfect so this is confusing the hell out of me. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"Wife and I[31 and 29] are planning on purchasing a home soon. We're first-time homebuyers, only planning on staying in the home for ~5 years, and are in a good position financially. I'd love any input from people in a similar situation.","As the title says, we're interested in purchasing a house, we currently live in the central Ohio area and plan on living here for around 5-6 years.

Our financial situation is as follows:

My income: ~80k
Her income: ~83k
My retirement: ~70k
Her retirement: ~105k
Student Loan Debt: ~20k between the both of us
CC Debt: ~1k between the both of us but pay it off every month, or at least most of it.
Auto loans: ~3k between the both of us

We're not really planning on having children for a couple years, so that shouldn't be too much of an impact. Her student loans are paid off, I have about 20k left on mine, she has ~1500 left on her car, I have about 2k. We plan on keeping both vehicles for as long as physically possible. 

We don't have any major finances expected outside of what's been previously mentioned. We were paying down my student loans at a much higher rate than necessary, but we let off at the prospect of purchasing a home. 

I've shopped around for loans a bit, and decided on Navy Federal. Currently, their 30 year conventional is 4.125% w/ no points. Since we're only staying for a few years, I don't see any reason to buy points. I'm pretty naive on the point system, so I'm basing most of this on what the lender said and what I've read around the internet. Furthermore, I've looked at a 5-5 ARM, but the interest rate is currently the same. We're looking to purchase home below our means, so ~ 200-230k with a down payment of roughly 25k. 

Mostly, I'm interested in the interest rate. I've heard of people getting lower interest rates, but I know that there are a lot of details involved. With planning to only stay there for 5 years, is there any reason to get a lower interest rate w/ points? 

Other than that, I'd just really like some input from others into their first home-buying adventure, and what kinda issues might arise, etc. On a closing note, one of my coworkers mentioned that a lot of the homes he was looking at ended up in people paying over the listing price due to popularity... we're looking to close around Thanksgiving and hope to avoid that.

I have a reasonable idea (I think) of what I should do generally, but just looking for some supplemental advice on what funds to invest in and which ones to definitely avoid. Honestly, a lot of these don't seem like the strongest funds out there, but it seems stupid to not at least take advantage of the match and tax break. Interested to hear your thoughts. I pointed out to management and to the advisor that it seemed like there were better funds out there and they plan to add what they said would be a few better PIMCO and Vanguard indexes in November and take out some of the worst performing funds. Also, please note that I plan to actively watch, reallocate/rebalance as necessary so I would rather not just dump it all into a target date fund as many things I have read suggest, if there are better options.

personalfinance,Advice on asking my parents for a personal loan as a down payment for an apartment.,"Info on top and main question in bold towards the bottom.

I've been living with my parents for the last 10 months and saving to buy an apartment, currently I'm at $10K. While living with them is fine and I'm pretty sure they don't mind I'd like to have my own place as soon as possible. 

I'm putting my money into the following funds (in order of most to least): housing, travel and emergency.

The emergency fund is just under $4K and I will cap it at 5. I have a couple of months notice at work and my union will cover 9 months of illness.

To make a down payment for an apartment where I live I'll need at least $40K. Which at this pace will take me close to 4 years. I plan on being a little more wise with my money along with putting less into my travel fund and more towards the housing account. But even with that and selling my car for a round $10K it would still take me \~2 years.

Hence asking my parents for a loan to have enough for a down payment.

My parents have it fairly good and while they have savings they don't have a lot of monthly income. They just invested in an industrial space which they plan on renting out. The apartment we live in could have been paid off but currently there's a loan on it standing around $71k. I don't have all the details on it but I think monthly payments should be in the $800 to $1200 range with a 2.90% interest rate with a 5 year duration (I know my dad paid $5K toward the principal last year).  


Even with having bought the industrial space they *should* have more than $80K in savings, which by my estimates they're getting just under 5% interest on at **most**.

**So my question is would it make sense for them and me, financially to** propose that I'll take care of the monthly payments on the loan they have on their apartment and they lend me the amount that loan stands at (or how much I'll need for a down payment). In addition to that I'd pay them an interest rate which is the difference of the loan interest rate and what they make on their savings account.

As a side question, if they agree how would I go about calculating the payments I make for the additional interest rate?",finance

I'm seeing that **all** of my Rollover IRA and my Roth IRA that I moved over is in the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (VMFXX).  Unless I'm reading it incorrectly, this looks to be performing much lower than what I would expect a 401k fund to perform at (5 - 8% right?).

personalfinance,Looking for advice on where to hold my Emergency Fund,"I don't think this question is going to have a ""right"" answer, I guess I am just looking for more of a consensus from the general people here.

Here is my basic info: 34M, 82.5k annual salary, 0 credit card debt, student loan debt under 1k. I currently have an Emergency Fund with a little over 8k in it, which is approximately 3-4 months of living expenses. For convenience, I have been building this fund in my Bank of America account so it would be easy to monitor and transfer into and out of.

In the past 6 months I have started a Wealthfront account, and once they put out their High Yield Savings Account, I experimented with it by putting my new car money there.  I have been very pleased with the returns and started thinking about moving my Emergency Fund over there as well. 

I have reviewed [The Emergency Fund page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/emergencyfunds) and found that it does advise you could split the fund up a bit to try and get some small headway with a Money Market account, but the way it is described I feel they are still talking about inside your main bank account, which for an emergency access makes sense.

Would I be putting too many steps, too much delay in access to my Emergency Fund by putting it all in the HYSA from Wealthfront? Maybe I should just do part of the fund, and leave the rest where it is currently. Has anyone gone through the process of bringing money back out of a Wealthfront HYSA and can give their anecdotal perspective on how long that took? Anyone else found themselves pondering the same question?

Thanks ahead of time for any and all input!


**TL:DR**
My Emergency Fund is in a bank savings account. I also have a HYSA through Wealthfront. I want to take advantage of the HYSA interest rate, but I am also concerned about not having fast access to it in an emergency. Should I just put it all in the HYSA? Maybe 50/50? Or leave it all with the bank so it really can be used in an emergency?",finance

Current situation: Got $8k in checking, $18k in Vanguard Fund, grew up in upper-middle class. Going to be living w/ parents for at least 2 years. 


I'm 23 and just graduated from a decent University with a Finance Degree (2.95 GPA). Once I graduated, I got a job with the Civil Service that starts at $42K (GS-07), but every year I get a $10K increase in pay for three years (ending at a GS-12). On top of that, in exchange for 3 years of service, they will pay off all my college loans (about $20,000). Also get a neat clearance.

I'm currently 2 months in and the job they gave me was not really what was advertised. Apparently HR wasn't communicating well with my supervisors. My current job much more business/admin than Finance and on top of that, I won't be really working till year 3 (I just go to government regulation training classes for 2 years). The job is with contracts and modifications, with the very occasional cost analysis. 

It's really boring work, but at the time it was my only job that I was confirmed to have. I'm starting to miss building Financial Models and really putting in what I learned in college.

 My typical day: I walk in early morning, go on reddit/facebook for 2-3 hours, go to a meeting, lunch, work on an online training class for an hour or two, then go on reddit/facebook till I clock out around 3:30pm.


I keep asking for more work, but my coworkers say that I'm not allowed to do some stuff, or I just sit with them and watch them do work. I eventually arm-pulled my supervisor into giving me work, and now I'm the go-to guy for correcting mistakes in ppl's Excel costs reports. Still, its a short part-time activity and its kinda discouraged. My boss fortunately understands my situation.

HOWEVER! At the end of 3-ish years, I'm going to be making around $75K w/ full Federal Benefits, and my loans paid off. Its pretty good money in my area of the south/southwest.


Questions:
 Would it still be possible to somewhat successfully break into the Financial Analysts career (corporate/banking finance) even after working 3 years in Business/contracts for the Government? Salary wise, around $70K?  Cuz at this point, I'm thinking that I should just keep sending resumes out till I get an Analyst job.

I'm young, immature, and passionate like any 23 y/o. So I'm curious what you think. After all the years you worked, would you have rather taken a job like mine? I don't know how I will feel 30 years from now, but having some context from you would help. Everyone at work always talk about retiring and pension. They're great ppl though.

I feel like it might be a better decision to just go private either now or later, but a lot of people at my job say that I should make this my career. At this point, I would only be this job for 1.) Money and 2.) Free time?

I’m aware that I shouldn’t be having a car payment in the first place because I can’t afford it outright. 

Any suggestions on my plan above would be greatly appreciated.

I'm from and based in Europe, and am having a hard time finding advice on what to do. I keep reading about US investment strategies and the paramount 401k, but there isn't really an equivalent over here, or I simply haven't managed to find one.

I'm 21 and live at home with my parents who haven't got much insight. They lost a large portion of their savings during the 2008 financial crisis and have mentioned that I should keep my earnings in different banks in varied countries and currencies. My accountant hasn't provided any advice either. It's been insinuated that there isn't really a sensible reason to invest in pension funds as it can't be guaranteed that you'll ever get the money back. I make roughly $14k a month after taxes and haven't got any debt, and would really like to invest my savings which are about 200k at the moment. I fear the looming recession, currency rates and inflation, and am getting anxious as I have no idea what to do. I've considered getting a small apartment in a larger city someplace as an investment without living in it, but I'm not sure if that's a good strategy. Keeping them in the banks doesn't sound smart either, the highest interest rate I could get is 3.5% (48 months). Are mutual funds safe? They've had a track record of 8-15% annual return these past 4 years, but who knows what the future holds. Should I buy stocks?

personalfinance,Mother-in-Law broke her foot and needs surgery with no insurance. We don't know where to start.,"As the title states my Mother-In-Law broke her foot. She is in her mid-50s with no health insurance and zero savings. She works as a bartender and will now be out of work for a considerable amount of time. When she broke it last week, she was told it would take 6 weeks to heal. Today, she learned the fracture isn't setting properly and requires surgery.


The hospital is requiring upfront payment for the surgery, and said with a discount for no insurance it will be $7500. 


She is a private woman and isn't upfront with the details of her income and expenses so I only know bits and pieces that I've picked up through the years so I will try to be as detailed as possible. There are no real assets to sell. She has a high, possibly 20-25% interest rate on her car (no joke), definitely owes way more than the car is worth. She's on a rent to own contract for her trailer. Her car is roughly $400 a month (no clue if that includes insurance) and trailer is $550 for mortgage and lot rent. 


We aren't sure where to start with helping her. Are there assistance programs she qualifies for? Medicare? Medicaid? Is there something drastic she should do? Her employer is trying to find things for her to do to give her some hours that are light duty and won't hurt her foot so technically she isn't unemployed.


She is in Michigan.

Doing calculations I will be paying the same with everything included in a mortgage (950\~) with just 3.5% down, as I would renting (950\~) in my area.  And that's having a house over a 2BD apartment, and actually having a yard.

btc,"Discussion: Do you guys/girls, really think it is right to value Bitcoin in terms of USD or any other fiat for that matter?","Ok, so I've been thinking for quite a while now, Bitcoin was created so that we could be freed from the clutches of the evil government and capitalists that control us from the shadows. (exaggerate much :P). 

Anyhow, tbh, valuing Bitcoin in terms of USD or any fiat for that matter is wrong according to me.

Why?

For the most simple reason, fiat isn't backed by anything, it has no value, and is subject to INFLATION. USD is controlled by the FED and hence the value is as they see it fit. This does not give Bitcoin a fair value.

What gives Bitcoin fair value?

Now, I'm not much of an economist or have ever studied economics, I'm a humble engineer, but curious af.

So I was thinking, what if we could value Bitcoin is terms of gold? I know it sounds crazy and outlandish, but trust me, this is a good idea.

personalfinance,Should I rollover and convert my Traditional 401k fund to a ROTH IRA?,"My company is changing names, so technically changing companies, which will give me the opportunity to make adjustments to my 401k. The 401k in question has $43k in ROTH funds and $33k in Traditional matching funds (fully vested). I am definitely rolling over the R401k portion to a RIRA. My question is, should I rollover/convert the T401k portion to a RIRA as well?

I am a strong proponent of ROTH and basically all of our 12% (mine) and 10% (wife) contributions are going to ROTH. We have 8% (mine) and 5% (wife) matching going to Traditional, obviously.

For reference:

 * This $33k makes up less than 10% of our total retirement accounts. 
 * Between all retirement accounts, 62% is ROTH and 38% is Traditional. I expect the ROTH proportion to grow as we focus all contributions to ROTH.
 * In 24% tax bracket and that won’t be changing until the tax brackets revert back to 28%. 
 * We would pay approx $9000 in fed and state taxes during the conversion of the $33k. We would have the cash to cover this, but it’s still a decent chunk.

Additionally:

 * We are 36 right now and plan to retire between 60 and 65. 
 * We expect to have two pensions at 60: $35k and $20k. Possibly another $30k pension.
 * Expect to take SS at 62: approx $30k total. (All in today’s dollars)
 * Possibility of part time work. If not and no third pension, expect to draw maybe $40k per year from savings.
 * There’s a decent amount of taxable investments.
 * We max RIRAs. Don’t have any money in TIRAs.
 * Paying for college is not an issue.
 * The 5-year-rule limitation is not an issue.

A major consideration is that I do not think we will need to draw heavily from these retirement accounts. Because of this, I want as much ROTH as possible to move to IRAs. This is to avoid RMDs and have tax free money to pass onto children. With the new tax changes to inherited IRAs, I don’t want to burden children with taxable IRAs that they have to cash out within 5 years during potentially high income years for them.

What would you do in this situation? Are there any details or pitfalls I’m not seeing? Am I overthinking such a small conversion?

On a related note, if i have the opportunity to take some more of that 38% of traditional funds and convert that to a RIRA, would that be a bad idea?",finance

investing,"Yields, operating cash flow, and stock prices","So I’ve been looking into yields recently. Here I am defining yield as the dividend returned and the stocks bought back added together divided by price.

One thing that is fascinating is that the yield has been mostly stable since 2009. The S&amp;P500 yields have been about 5.5% since 2009 all the way through 2019.

Earnings have gone up, the yield price ratio has been maintained, and the stock market is up!

But that’s not the full picture, how much of that yield came from free cash flow?

In 2010 companies were returning about 50% of their cash flow to share holders through dividends and stock buybacks, this paid for the 5.5% yield I just discussed.

Today, the majority of companies are paying out nearly 100% of their cash flow to buybacks and dividend payments. Some companies are even paying out 110 or 120% of their operating cash flow to shareholders, and taking on debt to make those payments. I know interest rates are cheap, but it seems odd to me.

At the very least it looks like the capacity for growth in yields, which seem to drive stock prices, has been reduced. From here the only way we increase yields is through organic growth of earnings and profitability in the companies underlying business (or I suppose just taking long term debt to pay out higher yields??)

For example, if you’re about to buy a house the lower mortgage rate is to your advantage, but if you’ve been saving that down payment in a high yield savings account the rate cut means a lower interest rate so you’d earn less from that account.

ethereum,Decentralised debt marketplace to connect lender and borrowers,"**Nuo network is a decentralised debt marketplace connects lenders and borrowers through smart contracts powered by Ethereum.**

Smart contracts helps to eliminate middle men interaction in lending and borrowing, which is not the case in the traditional finance sector(i.e uses bonds , using some x person as the proof who can cheat you anytime ..etc). The platform will directly facilitate the user interaction — lending and borrowing.

**DEFI VS FinTech**

With the rise in Internet usage it paved many new ways to interact, communicate and many more but it doesn’t provide new ways to actually create new financial instruments like bonds, markets..etc

But Ethereum Blockchain provided many new ways where you can replicate swaps, options, futures, bonds, or other financial instruments which are executed by and settled on Ethereum’s decentralised network with immutable records which is possible by the power of Smart contracts. Blockchain technology is doing to finance what the internet did to the media by democratising the creation of new financial instruments.

**Traction on DEFI**

Day by day Defi is getting a lot of traction in terms of user base and also industries who are trying to utilise the blockchain finance to be in the frontiers of the DEFI space. Shift from traditional finance to Decentralised finance is happening very quickly. More than millions of dollars are being lended and borrowed each day look at the stats below by Defipulse .  


[Source : Defi pulse](https://preview.redd.it/dzz8gipeask31.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f57be53a135df13313c542afc0e1d9999afcff2)

486.9 $ are being locked in the smart contracts of the defi projects which is really very huge

**What makes Nuo network unique?**

* Nuo network uses the concept of meta-transactions where you need to pay the gas each and every time you interact with the smart contract(Lending,Borrowing,Margin trading).
* Instead of using the p2p technique Nuo network uses the concept of reserve pool technique which is very good for the platform to sustain compared to other platforms that are using the concept of p2p technique,Where I should wait for the particular duration in order to get my funds back if there is something urgent and I should also trust the particular person who may or may not provide me the exact crypto currency that I lend because he can get loan of any currency but putting up the collateral which may be the currency that might be illiquid and that I’m not fond of.
* Rates on Nuo are totally algorithmic which totally depends upon the demand and supply of the currencies lend rates goes up when the supply in the reserve pool is very low and vice-versa
* Introduction of an insurance fund
* You are the owner of your funds I mean you can withdraw your funds anytime
* The interest is accrued in the reserve contract and distributed proportionally and periodically every day at 00.00 GMT

**Best Use-Case**

* Nuo network offers one of the safest positive-yield approaches to storing assets available on the market with non-custodial smart contracts.
* Nuo network provided all three features of lending, borrowing and margin trading at one place
* Nuo network is independent defi platform which is not on top of any other protocols like dharma being on top of compound…etc
* Nuo network provide the best interest rates compared to other platforms

**Is Nuo network safe?**

1. Nuo network smart contract which is the heart of the Defi is being verified one of the popular audit companies [Quantstamp](https://quantstamp.com/blog/quantstamp-audits-nuo-network).
2. All contracts are open source publicly available on Github . Everyone can look into each and every transaction and also what lending, borrowing and margin trading does.  


**Risks associated with Nuo network?**

Flash crash : When market crashes suddenly and losses incur but nuo takes care of these situations by ensuring that they have a robust, tested and secure price oracle which feeds the right price to the contract at all times. They have also added a buffer to safeguard the lenders further. If a flash crash or flash surge leads to network congestion then on-chain conformations and transaction finality are delayed which may lead to excess loss of collateral value. This may lead to a loss for the lenders in such cases.",cryptocurrency

A local credit union is offering a very attractive deal at the moment: I can transfer all of my Wells Fargo balance to one of their visas, and pay no interest for a year. After that point, I would start paying at a higher interest rate, to be determined when I actually apply for the card.

The grace period (until interest starts to accrue) is until January 29th of next year. In a few weeks from my new job I will have enough cash to write a check and completely pay them off in full. 

However, this would put my overall savings down to about $2000 Is this wise to do? Or is carrying this debt and paying a monthly payment better? I have a long established credit score (810) already by the way.",finance

personalfinance,Should I start paying off my loans or invest the extra money I have?,"I am currently going into my 3rd year of 5 years at a university. The reason for this is my school provides Co-op opportunities, where 6 months out of the year I am working at a full time job and 6 months I will be in school. Currently, I have taken out 40k in student loans and I got f\*\*\*ed with a 10% interest rate (I'm using discover student loans bc that's what my parents told me to use). As of now, my two loans have already accrued $4000 in interest but I do not have to pay anything until I graduate. I got very lucky and landed a high paying co-op, and with that combined with what my parents are giving me for school I am finally able to not have to take out loans anymore. I also discovered that not only will I not have to take out loans, but I'll probably have about 6k-7k in my bank account after paying for school, rent, food, books, all that stuff (I created a very intensive budget on excel to get my number). What I am wondering is what would be the smartest way for me to use that money in order to best plan for my future when I get out of school?",finance

personalfinance,Is a HELOC a good idea for what I'm trying to do?,"Bit of an odd question.  We are planning to move out of the country soon and I will need to sponsor my husband back to my country.  The immigration rules require that I have held $75,000 in savings for six months prior to the visa application.  They will also accept sales from a house owned for more than 6 months as satisfying this financial requirement.  However, since I am going back to my country in 8 months (with my young children who need to be registered for school), it would mean being separated from my husband for several months until his visa is approved, unless we had the money sitting in an account ahead of time (the HELOC).  Here are my main points of consideration:

* I understand interest rates on HELOC can be high, so I am looking into whether or not they are so high as to be prohibitive (there will also be significant costs we would incur if we are not able to arrive in the country at the same time, so the high interest rates may be mitigated by avoiding those other costs)
* The money would sit in a locked account until it is time to apply for the visa (so no risk of squandering).
* We are selling the house and would be re-paying the HELOC with proceeds from the house - which is originally what we were planning on doing to show eligibility for the visa anyway (just with the visa coming prior to the sale of the house rather than after).

Is there anything I'm potentially overlooking?  I'm comfortable paying a certain amount of interest if it means not being separated from my husband for several months (particularly considering the cost of maintaining two separate homes, the cost of using a relocation specialist to find a place for us vs us all being able to go together to find a place we all like, plus the money would be sitting in an account that would be bearing about 1.4% interest).  Am I understanding how a HELOC works - will they let me just take the money out and hold onto it or is it like a credit card where I literally have to spend it on something to withdraw from it?

Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Is a Cashout Refinance my best route?,"&amp;#x200B;

Is a Cashout Refinance my best route?

I have about $100,000 worth of debt between student loans ($65,000 @6% interest) and credit card ($15,000 @18% interest) and a loan from my parents($20,000 no interest but they are retiring soon and want to give it back asap).  Almost all of these bills are related to me going back to school.  I make 85,000 a year and my home is valued at $700,000.  I owe $245,000 on it.  My current interest rate is 3.875% and I have a refinance offer for 3.5% with $6,500 in fees.  I know that I would be paying more per month but it would only be around $170 and then I would be free of everything except my mortgage. I also have a little under $15000 in saving and about $60,000 in my 401-k but I don't want to touch those.  I am single so if an emergency or unemployment happens I need to be able to cover myself.   I just want to be rid of these bills.

Ps.  Selling is not really an option for me. Where I live is expensive and the only reason I can afford to live here now is because I bought 9 years ago.  My mortgage even with a refinance is about $1000 cheaper than rent and what I would get from a sales could not buy me something that wouldn't come with a larger mortgage.",finance

Chapter 10: Love Based Economy


What are our needs as individuals? What needs do we have in society? Every individual has the right to be fed, clothed, and sheltered in a safe environment. Every society has the obligation to feed, clothe, and shelter its people. Every individual has the right to explore their own path in life and uncover their abilities to maximise their potential. Every society has an obligation to provide quality educations at free to little cost. Every individual has the right to their space and personal privacy. Every society has the obligation to ensure the shelters provide the tenants personal privacy. These shelters should be independent homes and not emergency accommodation. Emergency accommodation oftentimes doesn't provide the safety and security that stable homes do. And no one wants to live in emergency accommodation anyway.

Society needs resources. It needs to spend less on war and more on building strong communities. The debt-based economy does not work. We need to spend a lot of time rethinking how we distribute currency. Capitalism has failed those with disadvantages and needs to be replaced with a more compassionate model. Old money controls our world and is responsible for the huge division in our society. Those who own the means of production are exploiting their employees by striving for low-cost labour and 100% efficiency. Our business models are so far from human that it turns employees into paper pushing machines. Society tries to make life predictable by having opening hours and reliability of services when you need them. But this reliability sacrifices our autonomy by enslaving us to particular hours, instead of when we feel fit to work. Our governments still approve projects that are against the interests of the health of our planet. Governments still have wars even though the people don't want them. And we somehow trust our politicians? I am a real politician. Those guys in White House are as fake as the media they control.

We need a complete redistribution of wealth. There is so much gold stored away that could solve all of our human problems. We have the potential to all be rich! We can all live in abundance and it isn't fair for stockpiles of gold to be collected while people starve on the streets. Old money gets bigger and bigger without doing anything to it. Its demand becomes greater as a result of less of it existing in the world because they are stockpiling it. So merely because they have the old money, it obtains new money that then becomes older money. They have created a system that enables privileged individuals to not work in life but instead create mischief for the poor. Any ""charities"" that they create are doomed to fail because they do not have the lived experiences and are useless to those who need help. Most ""charities"" that they create have a hidden agenda...

Central banks are so rich it isn't funny. They take your money, invest it, and charge you fees for the account. They lend you money at a much higher percentage than you would receive back if you were to open a long term savings account. They oftentimes need crazy insurance schemes placed upon a large purchase, such as home owner's insurance when purchasing a home. They own so many buildings. They know that property and buildings is where the money is at so that is where they invest. Their profit margins are huge and little is given back to their customers.

A more love-based approach to economics should be developed and implemented by the government. Our current approach is a literal poker game and one person ends up with all the dosh. It isn't fair for all who walk away with large mortgages, if they are even lucky enough to own their own home. Most of us poor just rent off the capitalists that invest into ripping me off on a permanent basis. I am not claiming to have all the answers regarding economy. Far from it, I try and stay away from money related issues. I don't like it how money turns people greedy. I have seen it a lot in my past. The more you have, the more you want. A journey that can never be satisfied. This can lead to people taking unscrupulous measures to obtain that money. I do think that a more Marxian approach would be beneficial to society if we didn't corrupt the model. But we are humans and that is what we do best.

Currently our economies are driven by greed. We can easily depict this with stocks and how depression periods can even drive people to suicide. Money is a means of distribution created by humans that has no inherent value in and of itself. Humans place that value in said money through a means of communal agreement, tightly regulated by industry and government. That value fluctuates depending on the market economy. This generally highly relies on harmful practices such as excessive mining. It also relies on how comfortable the general public are in spending their money in the economy. Socialism in its pure employment is the only system of government that seems fair to me. It ensures that we are all taken care of and this liberates us to focusing on our passions and desires which would ultimately be best for our social makeup. This would alleviate so many problems in our society to know that no matter what, we will be looked after.

Nature (us included) is in a process of coming to its perfect realisation. Thus when we see imperfection, we should also see the perfection behind it. For all bad will in time turn out for the good. Humankind is at a pivotal stage in their development and soon we will be able to both individually and collectively avoid our future errors. What is wrong is obvious when educated. The more the Internet educates us, the more our eyes will open. Eventually we will obtain freedom, albeit through a long process of collective suffering. Civilisation will in time evolve and not only grasp but also implement some of the ideals I am presenting throughout this book. Everything in this world is perfect. Because it comes out of the Creator and the Creator is perfect. Everything will come to perfection because that is the way that God created it.

The whole of nature doesn't depend on us. We cannot speed up nature's development. We can only speed up our own personal development. However, that will cause those we are close to to also speed up their development and as a result, nature's growth will speed up. Every previous state determines the future state. The way that we truly change is to connect to and love each other. We already love in a perfect world. God is not dependent upon time and has a plan for each blade of grass that He creates. Each evil in the world has its place and will ultimately be used for good. We are only subjective beings who can only see a very narrow field of vision. God is objective and interconnects all things. Just because we cannot yet see the good that comes from the bad does not mean that there is no good that will come from the bad. Our society is a flower in the process of blooming. Your heart is now in the process of blooming.

One who refuses to step outside of their own perspective to view another is indoctrinated. This accounts for most of our religions, for they see any controversy as evil. Believe as we do is what they say. They want you to convert to their perspective and become brainwashed like they are. Anyone who refuses to look for wisdom outside of their own holy texts are not truly seekers of wisdom. They are merely selfish people who are seeking a way to not pay for the consequences of their actions - to be forgiven of their sins without actually taking any positive steps to prevent future sins.

Specific details about a new economy are irrelevant because once we change our hearts, the rest will align. Once we start taking care of our people collectively, then the ways in which we utilise currency will change, for it will now reflect our hearts. If we eliminate greed from the planet by taking care of everybody's needs, then we no longer have need for war and famine. The world will one day unite under one flag. And that flag will reflect God's image. But heed my warning, for many will come in disguise and say that they are the uniting force but watch them very carefully, for the have ulterior motives. The pure will stand out of the crowd and not just be a copy. Don't try to fit in. Be unique! That is how God created you. Don't be afraid to be yourself.

The perfect economy will come with the perfect society. How that looks will depend on our collective vision of a perfect society. How that looks will depend on how the collective respond to people like me in the long run. This means that my success does not depend on the here and now. My work was created for our future generations. My sight was far beyond the here and now. The perfect society will come with the perfect people. The perfect people will come with the perfect person. Let that person be you. A perfect person is one who could have been no better than they are. Don't waste your time on useless entertainment. Entertrain your brain with positive stimuli. Trust me, the results will pay off. Just take me as an example. I was the test run in all of this and just look at what this type of education did to me. Open your eyes and see what is before you. It is called the education of a lifetime.

personalfinance,Advice around first time mortgage,"I’m looking to buy a condo right now and finding the process has lots of confusing little bits to it so I thought I’d ask a few things. Any insights are appreciated. 

I qualify for a mortgage rate reduction if I move a ton of assets to my bank. I already will get a rate reduction but there’s a second tier that I don’t quite reach with liquid assets. They say I can move the assets out of my accounts all I want after I get the mortgage. So I have a few questions on this:

1a. Is it legal to borrow money from a friend to park it in your bank account for this type of thing? My thought is no, but why not ask. 

1b. Second, how risky would it be to borrow against my 401k for that purpose? I’d be paying the money back in full immediately after closing, but I worry that it could hit my credit? I have excellent credit and almost no debt. 

1c. How important is it to reduce your interest rate by .125%? I tried online calculator and it seemed to save $20,000 over the mortgage lifetime. Not chump change but pretty minimal compared to the price of the place. 

2. Is it possible to roll my 401k over to my bank in some manner that doesn’t cause a penalty? I’m not switching jobs at the moment so I’m unclear.

3. I get a lot of income as stock RSUs. I’ve not been selling them, which has worked out well, but I’m curious if it would be better to pay down my mortgage once I get it by selling every stock That vests immediately, or to leave it in the stock market in some form?

personalfinance,Does it make sense to refinance? First time homebuyers.,"I posted this in r/mortgage as well, but not sure how active that sub is so I am also posting here to get any help I can! Our mortgage lender reached out to us saying that he believes now would be a good time for us to finance our mortgage and ran some numbers for us, but I would like help understanding if this is actually a good deal for us. We're first time homeowners, so any help would be great! Here are the details:

**Original loan:**

* Loan date: Jan 16 2019
* After down payments were made and all that jazz, our actual loan amount = $225,913
* Interest rate: 5.375%
* Loan type: Conventional 30 year fixed
* Monthly payment (including principal/interest + Mortgage insurance + Escrow) = $1860.48/month

**Refinance:**

* Anticipated loan amount: $232,750 (they're rolling in the refinancing closing costs and prepaids/reserves into new loan as we don't have the cash to pay that out of pocket)
* Interest rate: 3.5%
* Loan type: Conventional 30 year fixed
* Monthly payment (including principal/interest + Mortgage insurance + Escrow) = $1,548/month

**Other information that might be helpful:**

* We don't have plans on selling our house in the near future (maybe 4-6 years?)
* The house was purchased for $232,900 and the new estimated value per our lender's estimate is $245,000 (we've made updates to the house since purchase such as all new kitchen stainless steel appliances, new paint, new bathroom and bar flooring, a bunch of updated lightening fixtures, etc)
* My mortgage lender also said the following: ""Cash back to you – You also will get October off mortgage payment (new loan starts in November) and a refund of your current escrow account balance.  This could be sizable as your 2nd half taxes are coming due soon.  Combined you should have a cash inflow of anywhere between $2,000-$3,500+/- depending on how much is in the escrow account balance currently"". Not too sure what that really means for us. Wouldn't we just put that money back into escrow for our new loan?

personalfinance,Remodeling house and want to refinance,"First time poster here so forgive me for not using specific wording/acronyms. Me and my wife are younger and bought a home a little over a year ago, my wife works as a kitchen and bath designer so we made heavy modifications to the home during a remodel and are still in the process of remodeling still. Everything is functional and looks amazing, but things like backsplash, base molding, missing appliances and other finishing touches aren't completed still and likely won't be until the middle of next year.

We used a first time home buyer program that got us 3% of the home payment taken care of, but at an interest rate of 5.375% which was definitely high, but I confirmed that I could refinance whenever I want. Recently there have been fantastic rates around 3.7% for 30 year mortgage floating around and refinancing home loans is definitely in right now. We didn't put 20% down when we purchased the home because we wanted to remodel, and then refinance when it made sense, but the rates for better much faster than we anticipated so we aren't sure what to do here. The plan was to use the remodel as a way to refinance the home and get it reappraised for significantly more. We estimate our new value would definitely cover our 20% for equity which means we would lower our mortgage rate by about 95 dollars each month just from PMI as well as saving about 250 a month on the interest each month. 

What options do I have if I'm in the middle of a remodel during a fantastic time to refinance my home loan and what options make the most sense for my situation?

I'm a firm believer in paying interest quickly and snowballing payments by making them cheaper, but paying the same I have been to knock them out quicker, but don't want to refinance too early if the remodel not being finished hurts the appraisal or doesn't make sense.

So a bit of background, about a year ago I went through an awful breakup. My ex (not married) essentially emptied out bank accounts and took everything I owned out of my house. They also left me high and dry paying all the bills we had together, which were all in my name. Lesson learned for the future 😑

Needless to say, I was ill prepared for this and with emptied out accounts, had absolutely no money left.  I defaulted on my student loans which had JUST come due and put them in Forbearance until 06/2020. I also went into a lot of credit card debt trying to cover the bills and getting my life back together. It goes without saying, I severely fucked up my credit in process, going from about an 805 to a 625.

After costs, I should clear about $40,000 from the sale, which I’d like to put into paying off the debt I accrued from all of this.

I don’t know if it makes more sense to pay off all my credit cards, auto loan and the two highest outstanding Student Loan balances first, and free up $800-$1000 monthly to tackle the remaining $40,000 of student loans. Or maybe it makes more sense to pay off just the credit cards and sink the remaining into just student loans. 


I could really use some guidance here. I want to make the smartest decision financially to put me in a place where debt isn’t hanging over my head forever.

My medical insurance is GEHA HDHP:

* Have a deductible of $1500 but they contribute $900 to my HSA. Thereby giving me a net deductible of $600.
* Oral Surgery is covered under my medical insurance. After the deductible, coinsurance is 5%.
* I have not used the insurance at all yet (Payed $0 towards deductible)
* I pay $118 a month for this plan.

A recent idea I had was to purchase dental insurance with no waiting period. This is available to me for $28 a month (MetLife FEDVIP - Standard Option):

* Class C treatment is covered 35%
* This plan is $28 a month.

I am not sure how much wisdom teeth extractions cost on average. I am trying to figure out which is the most cost effective way.

I am leaning more towards my primary insurance (GEHA). For instance, lets say the worst case cost of the surgery is $2000, then I would pay the $600 net deductible and 5% coinsurance on 1400 ($70). For a total cost of **$670**. On the other hand, if I purchased the MetLife insurance, I would pay not only the 65% coinsurance on the $2000 ($1300), but also the premium as well for the entire year $336.

personalfinance,"Can someone explain these (seemingly garbage) offers I'm getting in the mail? (And on the phone, via email, etc.) What kind of suspicious Voodoo is this?","So, recently my credit score dropped considerably due to (as I understand) several factors, the most significant of them being that (unbeknownst to me, as I never received a notice in the mail) a card I had (one of the oldest credit cards I had) got closed out due to non-usage and having no balance on it. (As in, I didn't use it.)

I've been trying to find a way to consolidate some of my higher interest debt (mainly a personal loan I took out to buy some real estate, as the bank wouldn't do a mortgage of sorts for the small amount (&lt;$10,000).

I don't have trouble making the monthly payments on everything I have, and don't miss payments. But still, I can't help but feel like I could do better. So I started looking. As the internet does, that means I am bombarded with random semi-related offers. One of these types of offers, seems to not make any sense to me, and be incredibly suspicious, to the point that I'm not even sure they're real, and even less sure that it is a good idea.

The thing goes like this:

1) Receive ad, notice, phone call, etc. 

2) &lt;Whatever&gt; finance company offers low interest debt consolidation loan.

3) Explain the amount I want to consolidate, and ask what the interest rate they can offer me is.

4) They will then say they need to consult with their underwriting department, and they'll call me back. (Okay, whatever... )

5) They will call me back and say, 'No, actually, you don't qualify for a loan, but we do have another program that could help you!'

6) Wtf.jpg. That's not what I was asking about. But they'll explain that they will 'work with creditors' to close out accounts and reduce my monthly payments, etc. They'll go into detail, and (I guess they don't expect this) I write all this information down and then realize, every time, ""But wait... that's less than I owe on the principle balance of the debt I'm hoping to consolidate / refinance.""

7) They then try to justify how they're magic, and for a small (built into these payments) fee, they can 'make all my problems get better'.

8) I politely decline and hang up the phone.

What kind of bullsh*t is this? I have a friend that made this 'deal' with one of these types of companies, and it seems to have hurt his credit, not helped it. (Which, makes sense, cause you're 'defaulting on' or not paying back some of your debt... that would undoubtedly, under any remotely logical system, imply you are a less desirable borrower to do business with.)

** **

**TL;DR:**

Company approaches me and offers to 'work with creditors' to close out accounts and such, and somehow says that including the fee they'll charge, I'll pay back (in total) less than my current debt amount that they would 'consolidate' for me. 

1) Is this even a legitimate thing, ever?

2) How can these companies do this, if it is legitimate?

3) Isn't this similar in some way to bankruptcy, or default, in that it will hurt my credit rating, etc.? And could it cause other creditors / lenders to take averse actions regarding my accounts?",finance

Three simple things: know your product better than anyone, know your customer and have a burning desire to succeed.” He is right, but one element is missing: Money.

If you are getting a [**business loan**](https://www.onlinecheck.com/business_loans.html) for the first time, then there are chances than your potential funding options are minimal.

There is no denying the fact that the lender approves business loan application with a credible financial history and a perfect credit score. Does this mean you have exhausted all of your options? Read below and find the best financing options that you can benefit from as a first-time business loan:

**SBA LOANS**

**Small business Administration** (SBA), has been administering loans since 1953. It monitors and backs up the loan by banks, credit unions, and various other lenders. SBA loans are best known for their low-interest rates and the borrowers are allowed to choose the repayment terms as they desire.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Need some advice on paying of debts and moving forward,"So I will start by giving some background on myself. I have never really been financially literate until recently. Last year around March until now has been very difficult for me financially. In that stretch, I spent money faster than I knew and went from about $30k in savings/checking accounts to about $6k now. I have also incurred a deal of credit debt that was at about $12k as of 4 months ago. Like I said, I was financially illiterate. I never budgeted before, never checked my account balances or anything. 

About 4 months ago, I reached the point where I was not able to make the monthly payment anymore for my credit cards. I moved $7k from savings to my checking to pay off all debt on the one credit card (smaller balance/higher interest rate). I also started budgeting and realized where I could save more money towards paying off the debt, as that is my main goal right now. I did get a new job recently, which jumped me from about $400/month after expenses to about $1500/month after expenses. 

My first and major question is regarding where I stand right now. As it sits, I have $4600 in checking and $3000 in savings. I currently have $4519.95 on credit cards. The first one has $1778.62 on it, which I can pay off completely now (this is mostly expenses, but also some existing debt). This would then leave me another $500 or so to pay off part of the $2791.33 for the other debt. This would be more than the minimum payment and what I have added this month, so I am still cutting the balance down. 

Does this sound smart to do? I am trying to decide between two options here. The first is to pay off the debt as fast as possible, so I don’t lose out on interest and I can move out of debt as soon as possible, and start saving again. The second option is to pay off slightly less than the fastest I can, and start saving a little bit right now. The reason for this would be to build myself a little bit of breathing room in case of emergencies. As it sits right now, I have only 2 months of expenses between my 2 accounts. That does not give me much wiggle room considering life happens and I also need body work on my vehicle before that hard winter hits. I also am more than able to pay off the minimum payment on each credit card and then about $1500 more if needed, so I am already slowly reeling it in. The downside here is that I would have to carry that controlled and dwindling debt for longer. Which option would you suggest? My goal is to have all of the debt paid off by January or February. I work in an industry and for a company that routinely gives out yearly and quarterly bonuses. I won’t count on getting one, but it would move my debt free timeframe about 2-3 months closer. 

My second question is regarding what happens after the debt is gone. How do I improve my position for the future? I am 26 right now and think I have a good career projection for the future. I have been steadily paying into my 401(k) and have a separate IRA from my last job that is going to be growing as well. My goal would be to build up at least a 6 month buffer for expenses in my savings account, then a more working $10k in checking. After I have paid off all debt, that frees up a lot more money towards savings. My next move would be to take about 75% of the money I currently put towards debt straight into savings and just move forward from that. I would like to get more into investments (both short and long term), but I understand that will not happen until middle of next year at the earliest. I have been slowly working on financial literacy (wish it wasn’t this way, but live and learn), but still don’t know much about investments. I guess I just have some time now to look into that. 

Thanks for any insight, and sorry for getting very long winded here.",finance

personalfinance,"Best approach for obtaining mortgage on second home, what to do with current home?","Hi PF folks! I purchased a home in 2016 for $320,000 (appraised value) at 5% down and BPMI. I currently owe about $288,000 on it. Our county went through a revaluation this year to bring tax value up to approximate market value, which they put at $360k, putting me just at the 20% point to get rid of the PMI should I have a formal appraisal done through my mortgage company or decide to refinance. 

Due to some life circumstances, my wife and I are looking for a new home. Houses near good schools with enough space for my family are pretty steep at about the $325-$375k price range. I could simply sell the current home at market value and hopefully end up with enough cash for a hefty down payment on the new home. That would be easy and make sense. 

However, my home is handicap accessible, and my disabled father is interested in living in the house. There are a few ways we can approach this, and I'm not sure which is best: 

* Sell the home to him at market value. This removes the liability and obligated monthly payment from me, but then I no longer have the home as a long term investment vehicle and he'll be paying more monthly than what I'm currently paying (higher interest, higher purchase price, less equity). 

* Retain ownership as-is. I'm not sure how this impacts mortgage and insurance as it would no longer be my primary residence. This is the easiest approach since I have no idea where else my dad would go and doesn't require me to go through the selling process. However, I'm guessing it impacts my ability to obtain a new mortgage. 

* Refinance to get rid of PMI, albeit at a higher interest rate. I'm not sure if getting rid of PMI offsets the increased interest. I also don't know if him paying me as a landlord might constitute additional income to help with obtaining a new mortgage. 

Overall I'm concerned that keeping the house in any way will hurt my changes of obtaining a new mortgage. I'm in unfamiliar waters and not sure how people typically turn their primary residence into a rental and still get qualified for a new mortgage for their primary residence. 

Some additional financial info to guide the feedback: 

* Wife and I make 123k a year combined base salary. Her overtime puts us closer to 140k. 

* Student loan of $1500 at 160/mo. I plan to have this paid off before we make any moves. 

* Impreza car loan of $8629 at 170/mo. 

* Forester car loan of $16742 at 323/mo.

* All of our routine monthly payments and other expenses go to a Chase card that we pay off in full each month. Very minor other CC debt at $1000 which we'll have paid off this month or next. 

* Current mortgage payment with PMI and insurance/taxes escrowed totals $1850/mo.

Here is his mentality and how he sees the future: he states that irrespective of his volume of student loans, he will always pay back a percentage of his income (10-15% depending on the program). This being said, he  will always rely on the remaining 85-90% to survive and thrive. Furthermore, he has a very entrepreneurial spirit and plans to open many dental offices and run a big operation, and he says he will pay the minimum in his loans until he can afford to open these offices, which will then result in a high income. This high income will then lead to higher payments on his 10-15% which he will be more than happy to pay because it means he is earning more money. In the event that his income does not reach the expected level, he knows that he can fall back on loan forgiveness in X amount of years. 

&amp;#x200B;

This logic defies everything that was drilled into our brains in dental school: ""Do not live above your means or you will suffer later in life!""

&amp;#x200B;

Also as a side note: in the event that the 10-15% payment plan is one day removed, and he can't afford his monthly payments and files for bankruptcy, he states that he'll be safe because he will have no assets in his name. He plans to put all assets on his domestic partner's name, which he states that the feds cannot go after.

I know that there are a few unknowns here: will banks be willing to give him the amount of loans necessary to open practices as he plans to? Is loan forgiveness really that simple? Are the feds really that vulnerable? Plus other unknowns that I'm probably missing.

&amp;#x200B;

This plan seems difficult to refute (probably because I am a novice in finance). Would love to hear your thoughts and input. Please avoid being overly critical of my friend, and focus on hard financial facts.

personalfinance,Whether to consolidate and refinance student loans or not?,"So this seems fairly straight forward, I just want confirmation of my thought process. If I’m wrong please tell me now.

I have multiple student loans totaling around $40k. Highest interest rate is 13% and the lowest is 8%. My total minimum payment come February will be $420/ month. I was actually fairly lucky in that I’ve landed a job that pays me fairly well for entry level $52k in a very low cost of living area. I also am engaged and my fiancée makes $20k a year. There is also a ton of room for upward mobility in my position as well as certifications in my field being paid for. I really feel lucky.

My question is, should I refinance these loans to a lower interest rate? I’m committed to paying a significant amount over the minimum payment in the short term, but would eventually like to buy a house. I know that refinancing locks you into a longer repayment window (5-10 years).

Would I still be able to refinance to a lower interest rate and in the event of a windfall pay an excess amount towards the principal of the loan?

personalfinance,"I’m an 18 year old senior that will soon be working two jobs to start paying off a car loan, how should I start?","Next Friday I will take my drivers license test and pass. During that week I’m hopefully going to be employed by a one of the restaurants I applied for. I’m going to need a car to be able to go to school and to both of my jobs, so I don’t know where to get started. I’ve been with my credit union for 12 years (when I was a little kid) and they told me that my chances of being approved for the loan Sky rockets, especially since my credit is a blank slate. (just received my credit card yesterday) 

My credit union is partnered with a car dealer company’s ( carvana, Truecar) and I was looking at a reliable car that goes around 10k ($148 a month) and I thought i should be able to afford it, but my mom tells me it’s better to save up which is true. My mom is paying a few debts so if i co sign the car with her I may not be approved. 

I’ll get to the financial part.

My 1st job I only work weekends, so I receive a guaranteed 445 a month. My second job will be most of the week so I’ll probably make around 1000 a month.

So my income would be around 1445 a month, I’m planning on saving for the insurance and downpayment until next month. That’s the thing though, insurance.

As an 18 year old how would I even start, I heard it’s so unbelievably expensive as a teenager so I wouldn’t even know where to begin. My mom has her insurance with state farm so I was thinking being put in her insurance to get it maybe a little cheaper. I really don’t know where to start

Do you guys have any advice on what I should do, I don’t want to sound picky or stuck up, but with two jobs I’m really going to need a car soon.

personalfinance,Have to start somewhere - paying down credit card debt,"Hi all,

It's taken a lot for me to post here, but I have read through some awesome threads and people appear to be generally helpful. So I hope someone can also help give me some personalized guidance.

Here's my situation:

My wife (32 y/o) and I (28 y/o) got married this past November and we are expecting our first child in January. I am ecstatic but also terrified. Long story short over years and years of bad decisions, spending to make myself happy, I have racked up about 55k in credit card debt. And as I write this, I hate myself for even putting us/myself in this position. I am at a point where I need help. Thankfully, we moved from a high cost of living city up North to a city down South and our living expenses have been halved and we are both making more money now.

I just got a new job that is paying over 6 figures annually and I currently I bring about 6000 after taxes on monthly basis. Each check I transfer 900 (so 1800 a month) to our joint account to cover our joint bills and $150 ($300 a month) to our joint savings as we are hoping to eventually buy a house. I have a $289 car lease (just got a new lease because I was previously paying $400+ on my car I owned. Long story). My wife's job is also in the 6 figures and she is in a much better position in regards to debt than me, so her vow was to save for us while I focus on paying down debt (she's putting a lot more in our savings each check). Thankfully we have about $20k in savings that is building for our incoming child and potential purchase of a house (this is pretty much untouchable in regards to my debt).

So I am coming to this subreddit for help on how do I attack this debt. I also have a second job that brings in about 220 a week (I just started bartending 2 nights a week at a beer bar so I am not sure exactly how much will come in consistently on a weekly basis).

Here are my three options as I see it:

1. Non-profit debt consolidation: my only concern with this option is the hit I may take on my credit score and how this looks on a potential mortgage application if we start looking into a house say next year. So if anyone has any guidance on how this looks in regards to a mortgage, that would be super helpful.
2. A personal loan - I wouldn't go get a loan for ALL of my debt, maybe 25-30k and only if I can get a solid interest rate. My benefit here I think is that I get to keep some of my credit accounts open and my score should shoot up (and I understand the danger of having these accounts open but if I go this route - I will hand over my cards to wife to destroy/keep out of my possession)
3. Tackling it on my own using avalanche method: I have already set all my cards to auto pay, and I feel OK about this but I was wondering if anyone here thinks options 1 or 2 are better.

Just to go back into detail quickly:

Monthly, my minimum credit card payments total up to  $1,554.68. I have devoted about 2,400 a month to credit card payments as it stands. But as I get consistent with my side job, I can potential change this.

Thanks for any advice. And I understand where I messed up here. It's weighing on me greatly but I am hoping there's a light somewhere at the end of the tunnel.

Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Home Equity loan option question,"Earlier this year I used some home equity to purchase a second home in the mountains.

personalfinance,Student loans are a scam,"As like most adults around my age, I have student loan debt. Comparitavely mine is not as bad as others. (Original loan $28,500). But I have been paying towards it for a good 5+ years now. And guess what, it has not really gone down all that much. Right now it is just under $30k. I get the whole interest on the loan schpeel. But it seems like the loan is not reducing at all. 

So i looked into it today on where all my hard earned money is going. Come to find out, i have paid a little over $14k towards the loan. You would think id be closer to half of my loan being paid off, but not in this case. 

The service i go through for the loan shows where the money goes. So far out of the $14k i have paid, only ~$5k has gone towards the actual loan. The rest you ask? Well about $9k has gone to interest. Like come on...this is such a scam. It makes me super irrate that the goverment pulls this shit. And they wonder why my gen has trouble affording things. Rant over.

So i am coming to you guys to see what a good solution to trying to fix this. I was thinking of doing a higher payment every month to try and combat it. Or my other thought was trying to get a different loan from a bank that has a lower interest rate that wont drag me over the coals for my money. Any thoughts and ideas are welcomed.

Edit: i am on a 10 year plan for the loan where every year or so the monthly payment goes up.

Edit: thank you for the advice everyone. I already have a budget laid out for my other bills. Ive cut out frivolous spending and whatever extra money i have, i am going to put towards the loan to try and cut it down quicker.",finance
personalfinance,Options for Paying for Grad School,"My wife will be attending graduate school for a Masters degree starting in January 2020. It is a very specific degree (career wise), from a local state college, and the total tuition (36 credits) will be roughly 15k.

personalfinance,How Does Marriage Affect Apying for a Mortgage?,"Little background:

I purchased a home about three years ago. My credit wasn’t the greatest at the time and I didn’t have much saved for a down payment, so I applied for a FHA backed loan. 

As a result, I pay quite a bit in PMI. 

Since then, the home value has gone up quite a bit. I purchased the home for $265k, and similar homes in the neighborhood have recently sold for $340k. 

Also since then, I got married. My wife has excellent credit, and mine has been cleaned up considerably since my purchase. 

I feel with the recent drop in the federal interest rates, it’s a good time to re-finance.

Here’s a minor twist though... 

My wife and I are thinking of having a baby. If that happens, her parents (who are months from retiring) will likely move closer to us. If they do, they are looking to rent a home, rather than purchase - mainly because they do not want the responsibility that comes with ownership (repairs, etc). 

We live in a growing area (Austin), and a developer is starting a new community right by ours. When I put the deposit to have my home built, it took about a year to get built, and the house increased in value by about $20k before it was finished (I was locked in at the $265k price). 

As such, we are thinking it might not be a bad idea to purchase a new home, with the intent to rent it out to her parents. This would benefit them as their rent could be controlled to what we pay in the mortgage/taxes. If they were to rent from someone else, they would likely see significant changes in rent from year to year. Also, we would benefit as we’d gain some equity in the home at very little cost to us (her parents would be paying the mortgage). 

We have the cash for a down payment... and we have good, stable income (both of us earn low to mid $100k/year). We have no bills other than utilities and our current mortgage ($2400ish/month). 

My question is this... as my wife has never had a mortgage, and she’s not currently in the mortgage for our current house, could she be considered a “first-time home buyer” for a new property? I’m all for using “other people’s money” on a property - and if we could get another FHA loan in her name with a low down payment, we could reduce our risk in that home by not tying a whole lot of cash into it. Yeah, we know the payments will be higher, but the plan would be to re-finance once that home had gained some equity (which, given the current Austin market - it would gain a considerable amount just while being built - much like the current house). 

I think if we were to re-finance to get her in the current mortgage, she would lose that “first-time homebuyer” status, and I think we’d have to put at least 25% down on a new home as it would be considered an investment property. Correct?

We could afford a 20% down payment, but that takes out a large chunk of savings, which we’d rather keep liquid in case of an emergency. 

Anyway, just trying to get some advice. Any thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,University of Phoenix,"Hi! 

I attended UoP 12 years ago for one class in 2006. I applied for student loans prior and obtained a fed loan for this.

12 years later things are quite different. I'm almost done in my 4th block of nursing school and graduating from an associates program in 3 months with my ADN. I just enrolled in a bridge program to obtain my BSN (bachelors science in nursing) that would start in October as a concurrent enrollment.

UIU (BSN program)  require an official transcript from UoP. My ADN never required this and I didn't bother requesting it since the class I took was a nonsense 'group teamwork' 101 or some crap.

UoP told me I owe them $790 if I want the transcript. That they would 'work with me' but turned down my lowball offer of giving them $50 for a transcript. The appeal process for this is 30 days and I need to enroll in classes.

What can I offer them to settle this? It's been 12 years and I've never even had this show on my credit report when I applied for a mortgage? I just checked experian and this account isn't even present on the file???? I really want to get enrolled in the program but don't want to give these assholes a penny.

I recently made the switch from contractor to the government side. I am a GS 11 and  trying to figure out how much I should put into the TSP. Right now, I've kept it at the 3% mark, but I have been advised to bring it up to 15% by friends in the fed, which would put roughly 10k into my account a year. Does that sound like a good idea?

While I'm sure the answer is going to be an overwhelming ""yes"", I just need some reassurance since I have no knowledge in investments and all of that type of stuff. 

I suppose my only reason why I am hesitant to invest so much is because of the massive debt the country has right now and I would hate to put money into this and lose a large portion of it in the future. Being someone that knows so little of markets and financial stuff, I'm not even sure whether or not I should even be concerned about taking a massive hit or not.

cardano,Tax implications of Staking,"**Does IOHK plan to address the serious TAX burden it puts onto its stake holders?**

This should be considered heavily during the creation of  an incentives scheme, but no one is talking about it.

*Tax Implications with staking. The hidden devil.*

**The problem**: At the end of every epic (5 days),  rewards are distributed to its stake holders. Which means, every person  who delegates stake to the network will receive a taxable distribution  in the form of ADA.  This reward will have to be tracked, reported, and  taxed.

Each person has to figure out what the USD conversion of the ADA  price is every 5 days just to calculate the distribution they recieved  in USD. Then repeat and track this process for the entire tax year  (approx 72 epics per year).  Currently, there is no scientifically  proven, credible standard of a website to find this information out  (read: Coinbase and Binance are not reliable or open source). The price  wildly fluctuates every day. This undue burden and headache will prevent  mass adoption. It is a tax accountants worse nightmare. Not just for  federal, but also for state taxes.

In the USA, the federal tax code does **NOT** allow for an average of distributions received over the course of the year. A person **can not**  combine the total of ADA received for one year with the average yearly  price to find out their tax liabilities. Each ADA distribution has to be  accounted for individually.

On average, there is will be approximately 72 ADA taxable  distributions per year. With the current proposed incentive scheme, even  if your stake remains the same, your rewards will vary and the price  will definitely be different at the end of every epic.

This would prevent anyone that does not have a sizable amount of  stake from contributing to the security of the network. I know for a  fact, that my Mom, Dad, Brother and Sister; each of who have less than  50,000 ADA, will not delegate till this is resolved. I am going out on a  limb too say there may be others.

Charles, the Cardano community wants to know, **Does IOHK plan to address the serious TAX burden it puts onto its stake holders?**

**One possible solution is for IOHK to create a simple UI/UX interface that tracks the rewards at the end of an epic for each address and allow the user to select his local currency. Then have the UI display the value of ADA in that local currency on that date.** 

This would make our lives much easier :)

personalfinance,Pay off loans/interest or savings account?,"Hi everyone.

I wish I were better at thinking about my finances but I need help. I'll keep it short.

So I'm currently in school and have about 3 more years until I graduate. My estimated debt at time of graduation will be around 250k (depression is REAL). Currently, it's about 80k but I've been working a lot in order to pay for my car debt and other such expenses. In my savings account is around 19k since I started working at a young age and am able to save a lot because I live with my parents. My savings account though, only accrues about 0.01% interest compounded and I'm leaving the money there in case I run into some sort of financial crisis. It's my emergency fund but I feel like it's a bit much to save up and just keep there...

I want to start paying off the principal amount of my loan after I whittle down the interest (I'm paying off the interest as often as I can now) but I'm afraid of looking at that money drain so quickly before my eyes.

The average interest rates on my school loans are \~6%; the PLUS loans are 7% and the unsubsidized are 6%.

Should I start paying off the loan as much as I can or should I stick the money in my savings account now to a saving account that offers better interest such as Ally bank/Discover?

Thank you for your time!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: I forgot to add, the interest rate on my car debt accrues about 0.55 cents a day. I'm paying that off as often and as much as I can before anything else. I have only 3-4k left to pay off. I'm doing this because I'm also trying to build my credit.",finance

solar,DIY Install looking for input,"Hi everybody, I have been following this subreddit for a while trying to learn about solar. Thank you very much for the great collective knowledge. I live in NC and recently had 3 different companies come out and give me the install estimate, all estimates were north of 30,000. I decided to try to save money and do the installation myself.

It looks like this is the last year to get 30% federal if this is not going to be extended. In NC duke power is giving up to $6,000 rebate. If my understanding is correct, if I finish and activate my solar install within the last 3 months of this year I qualify to submit for the rebate for 2020. Apparently this year's rebate was gone within a few weeks in January so I will have to be on the computer Jan 1, 2020, at 12.00 am. Can somebody confirm for me if any of this is correct?

In my drawing, I was able to squeeze 45 panels on my workshop with 45 IQ7 inverters. Total system size about 14kW. In two or 3 years we will renovate the main house and connect the workshop and house together. Workshop roof is not facing perfect south, It is a little bit southeast. There is an option to add panels later on the front of the house facing west if needed. We consumed about 19,000kw in 2018, (shop has heat and AC) Shop is well insulated so a lot of that is going to air-condition and the heating existing house built in the '70s. With new house things should be better, We will install good windows and good insulation spray foam.

This are 60 cell panels in portrait configuration. I have 16 feet of height to work with. the last row of panels on top is going to stick out about 4 inches above the ridgeline.

It looks like to me that installing panels is the easy thing, creating and submitting documentation is going to be challenging. Is anybody aware of any local person or solar companies that would be willing to do correct paperwork for a fee?

I have 18k, enough money to pay off loan entirely. The loan is made up of two smaller 3.5% loans.

personalfinance,1k in debt and just need advice on budgeting,"25 years old and currently 1k in debt due to getting an unsecured loan through my credit union. The interest rate is 18% and I will be paying $92 for 12 months starting in October.

I got the loan because I wanted to help my mom pay off the utility bills and rent since I am living with her and help my boyfriend pay off our cellphone bill since we were behind. The family situation has been volatile ever since my mom lost her job of close to 30 years before she can go into early retirement and my sister and her family moved into my mom's two bedroom apartment. Fortunately, my boyfriend has been living with me and my mom for awhile and he has contributed a good chunk of his income to help the house. We just fell behind on utilities and rent cause me and my sister's stupid feuding.

I do work. It's my first job and I was financially independent since I've never worked due to severe mental illnesses. My current job is minimum wage and full time. I get paid $12 an hour and get paid twice monthly. First paycheck, I only get paid for 48 hours and it will average up to $400-$500. Second paycheck, I get paid for 66 hours and it averages up to $600. If I get lucky, the second paycheck comes up to $700. If I miss any days then it's only $300. It's a caregiving job in a non-profit. I'm still fairly new here as I've been at this job for 8 months. I only work 5-6 hours a day. My only bills are my credit cards from my credit union, Old Navy, and Fry's. My minimum payments on those are small though.

I want to disclose that I am a college dropout and I only have my high school diploma. I don't know if that's important, but I just wanted to throw that out there.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my car? Should I sell it and downgrade?,"Hey guys - I would like to hear some advice on a situation I am in. I am 25, about to start my first \*real\* job, and am currently rebuilding my credit (642/637 trans/eq, up from the 500s last year), and want to continue making good financial decisions. 

In 2017, I made a **terrible** financial decision: I bought a used, 2014 car (56k miles) at 16% interest, 72 months, around $20000 if I recall. My monthly payments are $410 currently, and after almost 3 years of paying it I currently still owe an egregious \~$14000 because of my interest rate, and it now was 85k miles on it. I have been deciding whether to refinance or sell it at a net loss and buy a cheaper car at a better rate. 

What is my best course of action? I do need a car to get to work, and I don't yet have the savings to purchase a cheap car in cash. A couple thoughts that I have had:

1) Is refinancing my car worth it? Sure, I can probably get a better interest rate and a lower (much lower?) monthly payment, at the expense of putting my 5 year, 85k mile car that I already owe 3.5 more years on into a longer term. 

2) Regarding selling it, I have a few options. KBB/online appraisals have set \~$13000-$13500 as its current value. It is in great shape, sans the 85k miles on it. I went to a CarMax and they offered $12300 for a trade in. I have been exploring the idea of possibly just taking a trade in and having to pay the difference between that and what I still owe, which likely ends up costing me $1000-2000. I could then buy a cheaper car, and probably have to put more money down, but at least I will be in a better loan and in a car with lower miles. 

3)I *can* afford my monthly payments of $410 just fine, although I'd prefer to be paying less. The option of just paying off the original loan by 2023 is obviously on the table. I could probably make higher monthly payments (although not by much) and try to get it wrapped up quicker. Still, I'd rather not do this, as I would much prefer to be saving my money instead of dumping it into my mistake of a car loan.

Any advice to these points/any other suggestions be greatly appreciated! I understand the decision to buy the car was awful and I am trying to fix it, and I think this is a good place to start.

personalfinance,"My former employer is offering me an opportunity to cash out my pension benefits. I think this would be a good idea, but would like some feedback/advice.","This was my first job out of college, and I was with this company for 8.5 years. A year or two after I started there, they got rid of their pension benefit, so I was part of one of the last groups of people to receive it. I got some information in the mail recently offering an opportunity to cash out my pension benefit early. Obviously, from the employer's point of view, they're trying to lessen their future financial obligations, which I get. I think it would make sense to take them up on this offer, but would like some other opinions.

I have three options:

1. Elect to receive a single lump sum payment of a little over $22,000 in December 2019. This could either be in the form of cash (subject to 20% federal tax) or rolled over into an applicable retirement plan.
2. Elect to start receiving monthly benefit payments now at a greatly reduced rate than if I waited until I was 65. This would end up being about $95 per month.
3. Do nothing and wait until I'm 65 for the official pension benefits to kick in. At age 65, I would start getting about $350 per month.

I think my best choice would be 1, and to roll it over into my Vanguard IRA, if possible (I also have a Fidelity 401k through my current employer, but I like my Vanguard IRA funds a lot more). My reasons for this thinking are as follows:

* I'm 34, getting married in a month, and my girlfriend and I have no debt aside from our mortgage (in both our names, and we have no trouble paying it each month) and her car payment (in her name only, about $3,000 left on the loan, and she's paying it off monthly)
* I am very financially stable and responsible. I make around $90k per year, and between my IRA, 401k, and a regular Vanguard brokerage account, I have about $300k in retirement savings. I really don't need a sudden $22k in cash for any reason, and the tax implications don't seem worthwhile. The only major expense we might have in our future is buying a new house next year (still not decided), and we currently have about $60k saved in an Ally savings account for a potential down payment, which would be at least 20%.
* I haven't done the math, but I feel like putting $22k in a well-performing IRA now will earn me more money to use in retirement than doing nothing and receiving $350 per month from this pension benefit.

Does this seem like a good idea? Is there any reason I *shouldn't* take this offer, given that there's not really all that much, relatively speaking, in my pension benefit? Are there any implications I'm not thinking of regarding doing this?

EDIT: It's probably also worth mentioning that this former employer is a health insurance company, so I believe waiting until I'm 65 would only work if they still exist in 30 years, right?",finance
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 9th, 2019","Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 9th, 2019.

# **Stocks look to reclaim their all-time highs in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/06/stocks-look-to-reclaim-their-all-time-highs-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks will look to build on their strong recent momentum and reclaim their record highs next week amid a slew of economic data while trade war fears decrease.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is about 1.6% from an intraday record reached on July 26 after notching back-to-back weekly gains. The broad index is up 1.8% this past week after surging 2.8% in the last week of August.
*****
&gt; Wall Street’s move toward all-time highs comes as recent U.S. economic data suggests a recession may not be in the cards, and the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates later this month. Easing fears around the U.S.-China trade war are also lifting investor sentiment. If the data remains solid, Fed rate cut expectations stay high and U.S.-China trade tensions lower, the market could climb back to all-time highs.
*****
&gt; “You cannot sell the market ahead of the Fed and you cannot sell the market ahead of the trade talks in October,” Steve Grasso, director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel and a CNBC contributor, told “Power Lunch.” “For now, it’s a bull run.”
*****
&gt; The U.S. services sector grew at a faster rate than expected in August, the Institute for Supply Management said Thursday. The data offset worries from the manufacturing sector. The ISM said Tuesday that the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the first time since early 2016.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the Labor Department on Friday reported better-than-expected U.S. wage growth for August at a time when consumer spending is strong. However, the report also showed jobs growth slowed for a third straight month.
*****
&gt; “The U.S. economy should avoid recession,” Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC, wrote in a note. “With slower, but still-solid job gains and good wage growth, households will continue to spend; consumer spending accounts for almost 70 percent of the U.S. economy.”
*****
&gt; Investors will get more information on the state of the consumer next Friday with the release of August retail sales and a preliminary look at September consumer sentiment. Positive data on that front could lift stocks to their records.
*****
&gt; Next week will be important as investors get more clues about the Federal Reserve’s next policy move. August readings for the producer and consumer price indexes are scheduled for release Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Fed has cited persistently low inflation as one of the reasons for easing monetary policy in the U.S. In July, the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points. Market expectations for another quarter-point rate trim in September are at 93.5%, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; However, stronger-than-expected inflation could raise questions about whether the Fed will reduce rates later this month.
*****
&gt; “Anything that is speaking directly to inflation is going to be most important” for the market, said James Masserio, co-head of equities in the Americas at Societe Generale. “That’s going to be weighted most heavily in the central bank’s monetary policy decision-making process.”
*****
&gt; “Right now, all asset classes are being greatly influenced by the expectations of changes in monetary policy,” Masserio said.
*****
&gt; The Fed is not slated to meet until the week of Sept. 17, but the European Central Bank will announce its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday. The ECB is largely expected to cut rates with some experts forecasting a restart to its quantitative easing program.
*****
&gt; News around U.S.-China trade talks will continue to play a role in the market next week as investors look for signs of progress in the negotiations. On Thursday, China’s Ministry of Commerce said Chinese trade officials will meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington next month.
*****
&gt; “If there’s a bit more optimism around trade, I think we could get back to those previous highs,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. “We’re not far from the previous highs. It wouldn’t take much to get there.”

# Meager “Worst Months” Gains Still the Norm in Pre-Election Years

&gt; With a little more than four months of DJIA’s and S&amp;P 500 “Worst Six Months” already completed, the markets performance thus far has been lackluster and in line with historical averages. NASDAQ’s “Worst Four Months” (July through October) has been similar to DJIA and S&amp;P 500. From the close on April 30 through yesterday’s close, DJIA gained just 0.51%, S&amp;P 500 1.02%. From the end of June NASDAQ has gained 1.38%.

&gt; These are rather slim returns for the amount of time. And this excludes the volatility the market experienced in May and again in August. At their respective lows during late May and early June DJIA and S&amp;P 500 were down over 6%. At the August low, NASDAQ was off nearly 3.5%. Our Seasonal Switching Strategy exited DJIA and S&amp;P 500 positions on May 2 and rotated into bond positions. Those bond positions were up an average of 10.1%, excluding dividends on September 4.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 9/6/19

&gt; Despite a shortened week from the Labor Day holiday, there was a heavy slate of economic data with a total of 30 releases. Half of these came in better than estimates or the prior period's reading while another 13 missed or weakened. Three indicators were in line with estimates. There was a lot of manufacturing data this week including readings from Markit and the ISM, Factory Orders, Durable Goods, and Capital Goods. The ISM reading was the most strikingly negative of these as it showed a contractionary reading. The ISM and Markit service counterparts, on the other hand, showed healthier levels, but the Markit PMI did miss estimates. Labor data also was a major focus this week and the overall results were pretty mixed. ISM employment, initial jobless claims, and today's NFP report all disappointed, but the ADP employment change, continuing claims, and labor force participation rate came in stronger than expected. Similarly, each indicator for wages including quarterly unit labor costs and average earnings showed improvements.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090619-Eco.png))**

&gt; It will be slightly less busy next week with only 24 releases scheduled. Following up on this week's labor data, the JOLTS report is due out Tuesday morning and is expected to show fewer job openings than June. Inflation indicators like PPI, CPI, and export and import prices make up a considerable portion of next week's data. Core estimates for both PPI and CPI are forecasted to show higher price inflation in August. In addition to preliminary consumer sentiment, on Friday we will also get a reading on retail sales for August. For both core and headline readings, this indicator is expected to slow significantly MoM compared to July.

# Economic Surprise Index Turns Positive

&gt; When it comes to economic reports, one trend that has seemingly been in place all year is that the vast majority of data points have come in short of expectations. The fact that economic momentum has been slowing is one thing, but when the economy consistently comes up short relative to expectations, it sets a tone that things are quickly deteriorating. That's never a good thing, but thankfully, there are signs that the tide is turning.

&gt; The Citi Economic Surprise Index measures the pace at which economic indicators are coming in ahead of or below consensus forecasts. When the index is negative, it means that the majority of reports are coming in below expectations, while a positive reading indicates that most data is coming in ahead of expectations. The chart below shows the index going back to 2003, and the parts where the line is red indicate periods where the index was negative for at least 100 trading days. The most recent period of negative readings was one of the longest ever at 140 trading days and just the 6th streak of 100 or more trading days (during the period from 2015 to 2016 there were actually two separate streaks although it looks like just one long streak in the chart). The fact that this index is now positive indicates that economists have finally ratcheted down estimates enough to be in line with actual conditions on the ground.

# Sentiment Back to Normal

&gt; Bullish investor sentiment as measured by AAII's sentiment survey rose 2.5 percentage points to 28.64% this week. While this is an improvement, bullish sentiment is still in the 18th percentile of the data over the past decade. We must also note that the survey would not have captured any benefit from today's news on the trade front and the technical breakout of stocks and other assets like crude oil. Save a tweet or a headline reversing what appears to be optimism given today's positive price action, we'll likely see a bigger jump in bullish sentiment next week.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090519-AAII-Bullish.png))**

&gt; Bulls borrowed from the bears this week as bearish sentiment fell from 42.2% last week to 39.5%. As with bullish sentiment, this is not necessarily a dramatic improvement as it is still higher than 83% of weeks over the past 10 years. Bearish sentiment also remains the predominant sentiment level among investors as the bull-bear spread is still fairly wide at -10.87 percentage points. Granted, that is the narrowest spread since the last week of July when it was only 28 bps in favor of bears.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/090519-AAII-Bearish.png))**

&gt; The bulk of the loss in bearish sentiment went to bulls, but a small portion also went to the neutral camp as the percentage of investors reporting as neutral grew to 31.9%. While bullish sentiment is still several percentage points below its historical average and the opposite applying to bearish sentiment, neutral sentiment has been pulling back to its historical average over the past few months. Where it currently sits at 31.9%, it is only 0.33% from that average.

# ISM Services Shows Little Pressure in Inflation

&gt; Following Tuesday's ISM Manufacturing report, we noted the extremely low reading in the monthly ISM Commodities Survey, which measures the number of commodities rising and falling in price. After today's report for the Non-Manufacturing sector, that trend remained in place. In this morning's report, respondents noted price increases in just 6 commodities and decreases in 4. That net reading of +2 is the weakest reading since January. Combining the results of both reports, in August we saw a total of just 8 commodities up in price and 15 lower. That reading of negative 7 was the lowest since February 2016, while the three-month moving average of -4.0 was the lowest since April 2016.

&gt; As we noted on Tuesday, low readings in the commodities survey usually track the direction of inflation readings pretty closely and would imply that the current y/y reading of 1.8% in CPI will see downward pressure in the months ahead. For example, in the eight prior months where the three-month moving average in the combined reading was between zero and negative five, the average y/y reading in CPI was +0.45% while the median level was +0.65%.

# Low P/E, Low Return

&gt; Most investors are trying to forget about August performance as quickly as possible, but we wanted to highlight a noteworthy data set about the month before it gets too far into the rear-view mirror. At the end of every month, we run our decile analysis of the S&amp;P 500 to see which stock characteristics drove performance the most. One characteristic we look at is valuation, and in August, valuations played a big role in performance.

&gt; Below we've broken up the S&amp;P 500 into deciles based on P/E ratios (trailing 12-month). Decile 1 contains the 50 stocks in the S&amp;P with the lowest P/Es at the start of August, while decile 10 contains the 50 stocks in the index with the highest (or negative) P/Es. Each bar in the chart shows the average percentage change in August of the 50 stocks in each decile.

&gt; As shown, the 50 stocks in the S&amp;P with the lowest P/E ratios at the start of the month fell an average of 11.5% in August! The next two deciles with the lowest P/E ratios fell more than 5% as well. On the other end of the spectrum, the 50 stocks with the highest P/E ratios fell only 0.78% in August.

&gt; You've certainly heard a lot about the ""death of value investing"" recently, and this is why! We have to think that at some point the scales will tip and head in the other direction.

# Down August, Up YTD, No Worries

&gt; Now that the very volatile month of August has finished on the downside folks are concerned about the other worst month, September, and for good reason. Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year. However, while August was negative this year with the market still up year-to-date the prospects for Q4 and the year as a whole are not so ominous. In fact, it’s kind of bullish.

&gt; Early last month we relayed the historical data on August declines being quite commonplace though overall, years with August declines were quite choppy and not especially bullish. However when the market was up year-to-date at the end of August despite an August decline the picture changes dramatically. In the tables here you can see that after some extended volatility and negativity in September Q4 and the year as a whole has been rather positive.

&gt; Since 1949 in years the market was up YTD in August but down for the month DJIA was up in September 56.3% of the time (9 of 16) with an average gain of 0.76%, up in Q4 81.3% of the time (13 of 16) with an average gain of 5.68% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 17.43%.

&gt; The S&amp;P has a similar record up 58.8% of the time in September (10 of 17) with an average gain of 0.81%, up in Q4 94.1% of the time with an average gain of 5.73% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 20.21%.

&gt; Since 1971 NASDAQ was up in September 66.7% of the time (6 of 9) with an average gain of 0.35%, up in Q4 66.7% of the time (6 of 9) with an average gain of 4.04% and up for the year 100% of the time with an average gain of 21.72%. NASDAQ was hit much harder in the 1983 bear market and 1997 Asian Financial Crisis than the much larger cap (at the time) DJIA and S&amp;P.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,Use Savings to Pay off Car Loan,"Hey Gang,

So the title pretty much sums it all up. The car loan is really the only piece of debt that I have. I have a little under $9K left on the car with an APR of 1.9%. I have about $12k  in savings with an interest rate of about .2% or something very low and another $2.8k in my checking. My monthly total bills with the car payment (which is $750.00 - $500 + an additional $250 each month) is $2744.00. Without that car payment, I'd save that money, but my 6 month emergency fund could be replenished in about 6 monthly (I have other money going into my savings + 401k). I know the inherent risks of using up my emergency fund, however I'd have a little over 2 months of monthly expenses saved up, and without that debt, I'd be debt free.

What are some of your experiences in doing this? 

Thanks for reading.",finance
personalfinance,Lending club consolidation loan VS. Debt avalanche (keeping credit cards with balances),"Long story short, 

My wife and I are attempting to save for a house and get my credit in check (some mistakes from my past)

We have some debt between us from starting a company and some random consumer debt.

Would  it be better to get a consolidation loan (paying more than the minimum) so that all our debt is in one place?or would it be better to keep the debt spread out on our cards?

**How does a consolidation loan like this affect home loans vs having outstanding debt on credit cards?**

We have combined \~7-8 credit cards we are paying down, the highest balance being 6k, down to the lowest balance being around $700. However, the interest rates are all above 24% YIKES....about 3 cards of the 7-8 are over 35% of limit.

I think our credit is around 670 for her and 620 for me (on the rise from 300 \~ 3 years ago)

We are hoping to be in a home of our own within a year and I really want to fix some of my mistakes and make this better for us. She inherited a nice chunk for a downpayment, so I'm not worried about that, more so, my credit score. I don't want to be a reason we DON'T get approved for a home. :( 

Any help, guidance or information is greatly helpful! 

I've checked out the resources on this sub, but didn't find the specific answer I was looking for.

1: Last year I had a right to a refund of all federal income tax withheld because I had no tax liability, and 2: This year I expect a refund on all federal income tax withheld because I expect to have no tax liability.

personalfinance,"Student Loan balance due, can't pay, disabled but yet awarded disability (likely will be denied)","I'm hoping to get some good advice on what to do about my student-loan situation. I currently have 3 subsidized loans serviced by Nelnet, totaling $9,400 with an interest rate of 6.8%. Due to mental-health/medical issues, I have been unable to work enough to pay my loan for the past several years. I have exhausted all of my deferment time allowed, and my loan payment is due next month. I am going through the Social Security Disability process, but it won't be finished by next month. I will have months left before a decision and then will likely need a hearing. Because of the intricacies of my case, I am doubtful that I will be approved for disability. Unfortunately, my care providers determined me unable to work. However, the government has different criteria. So I will not be able to work and make the payment.

As far as I know, my only option is to do Income Based Repayment, which would allow me to pay nothing now. The problem is that it seems like it would cause my loan to move from 8 more years of repayment (I've played 2) to 25 years, which seems that it would bring my repayment from about $15k up to about $45k, which is astronomical. I'm not 100% sure on how IBR works but can't see tripling my loan repayment if I am somehow able to begin making payments sometime next year.

I'm hoping I can get some ideas of what I might be able to do. Obviously if I am approved for SSI, I should be able to get a doctor to sign off to discharge my loans. But it's looking unlikely that I will be determined disabled by the SSA's criteria (please refrain from comments of ""get a job,"" as I have multiple documented disabilities. SSA is just trying to argue they aren't severe enough so they can deny me). I have no idea what to do, and my mental health and depression has gotten extremely worse due to the pressure of this payment nearing. Because of my disabilities, I am unableto handle money or really understand what my options are here, so I'm really relying on personalfinance to give me some advice.

Thank you for your help.


EDIT: I'd also appreciate an explanation of how IBR affects my ability to make extra payments. Since my loans are currently under 10k, I would love to pay them off quickly if I'm able to work in some capacity in the next several months or year, e.g., maybe I could pay 5k per year or something. But, I don't understand how that works if I have to do IBR now since I can't pay. If I become able to make a payment, will my balance still be $9,600? And will I be able to make larger payments on my balance? Or will IBR force me to pay $40k+ because I had to switch to it for a few months? Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Financing larger purchases?,"EDIT: Just to clarify, for a lot of the responses, YES, I technically can afford to buy it outright right now. I would never spend money on something that I didn't have the money for. I know that's a very bad idea. I was just thinking for evening out purchases. You guys are probably right though, having too many of those deals on smaller purchases can probably get messy. I'll save those types of things for multi-thousand dollar purchases, like cars or other long term investments.

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of online stores that offer financing on larger purchases, and I was just wondering how people can keep track of all of that or whether or not it's a good idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw it first a while back for purchases from the Google store when I bought my Pixel. I didn't end up utilizing it, because I didn't really know what to think of it. I understand that sometimes, you don't have to pay interest for a while, which sounds nice. Basically, if you don't pay interest for 6 months, then you could purchase a $600 item, and then pay $100 each month. If you want to, you can pay the entire thing off in full any time you want!

&amp;#x200B;

Where I see it becoming a problem are if I were to finance something, and then I somehow don't get enough money for it within the time allotted for no interest. If I make that $600 purchase, start paying $100 a month, and then 3 months in, a financial disaster strikes, and I can't make the $100 payment, then I'm in trouble. So by purchasing it outright, when I'm confident that I have the money to do so, I avoid this risk. If I did have a financial disaster, at least I don't have interest being added on top of my head as well.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like it would also get confusing with how many different accounts or ""cards"" you end up having. You could have an Amazon Store Card, a Google Finance Card, and a Samsung Finance Card depending on what all you're buying from where. They all have different terms, interest rates, and hidden manipulations that you have to watch out for. How do you manage all of this simultaneously without making an error?

&amp;#x200B;

Where I can see financing being beneficial is that it balances out your purchase. Even if you DO have the money to just buy it outright, you can spend just an extra $100 a month instead of $600 in one month, which allows you to spend money in other places you might need to. Even if you could buy it outright, this may provide more financial stability, so long as you make the payments properly.

At the time, our salary was a total of $87k and our mortgage was for $370k, 30 yr fixed, with an interest rate of 4.625%. Currently, our combined salary has gone up to $162k and interested rates for a 15 yr fixed are at 3%.

Excluding our escrow, our current monthly mortgage payment is $1,403 in interest, $493 in principle, and $800 in extra principle payments.

The downside to refinancing is the upfront closing cost and we would have to get PMI until we have 20% down in equity. We would rather not use money from our emergency fund so we would wrap closing costs into our mortgage, about $6k.

Beneath China’s stable headline numbers, there is a growing belief that the real picture is much worse

By Mike Bird and Lucy Craymer
Sept. 8, 2019 12:29 pm ET

In the second quarter of this year, official Chinese data showed economic growth of 6.2%, close to Beijing’s target and within a percentage point of what it has reported every quarter for the past 4½ years.

A few months earlier, satellites monitoring Chinese industrial hubs suggested parts of the world’s largest trading economy were contracting. An index of Chinese industrial production created by a multinational manufacturer was pointing to lower growth than official figures. And a web-search index used to gauge how many workers return to their jobs after the Lunar New Year holidays was down sharply from a year earlier.

Beneath China’s stable headline economic numbers, there is a growing belief among economists, companies and investors around the world that the real picture is worse than the official data. That has analysts and researchers crunching an array of alternative data—from energy consumption to photos taken from space—for a more accurate reading.

Their conclusion: China’s economy isn’t tanking, but it is almost certainly weaker than advertised. Some economists who have dissected China’s GDP numbers say more accurate figures could be up to 3 percentage points lower, based on their analysis of corporate profits, tax revenue, rail freight, property sales and other measures of activity that they believe are harder for the government to fudge.

China, whose GDP topped $13 trillion last year, is still growing, and the alternative data points to that. It indicates the deceleration is happening in areas such as manufacturing. In many cases, alternative indicators have previewed the path of official data and show the depth of the challenges Chinese authorities face.

“Manufacturing is being hit really hard,” said Leland Miller, chief executive officer of China Beige Book, which measures China’s economic strength based on thousands of survey responses from mainland companies. “Investment is down, hiring took a serious hit, a huge hit to new orders.”

China on Friday released billions of dollars to banks in an effort to revive business sentiment as the U.S.-China trade battle continues. The People’s Bank of China reduced the amount of money commercial banks have to hold in reserve, enabling lenders to finance projects.

Much of the data “is telling us nothing good about the China economy,” said Eric Pratt, head of global marketing at AVX Corp. , a maker of electronic components based in Fountain Inn, S.C., which has two Chinese factories producing parts for cars and mobile phones. Mr. Pratt said over the past year, as alternative indicators and forecasts pointed to more weakness, his company cut some jobs and slowed production.

Over the past decade, China’s growth has made up between a quarter and a third of the world’s economic expansion. The country’s size and interconnectedness around the globe now means small changes in output impact the performance of all major economies, including the U.S. and trade-oriented ones such as Germany and Japan.

Since the escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict, suspicion that China may be massaging its official data to paint a picture of broad economic health has become a challenge for Washington. U.S. trade negotiators have been seizing on any signs of weakness in their attempt to squeeze more concessions from Beijing.

As the effects of tit-for-tat tariffs filter into China’s economy, the country’s government has also tightened access to data that has proved reliable in the past, in some cases stopping the release of indicators that paint an unfavorable picture.

In December, a manufacturing index for the trade-intensive Guangdong province was suspended after trailing national figures for months. The country’s National Bureau of Statistics said the local government that produced the index didn’t have permission to do it.

China’s official unemployment figures haven't changed much since the trade war began, raising questions about their reliability.

One challenge for businesses and investors is that China’s economy can’t be easily deciphered using measures such as unemployment and real GDP growth because those numbers don’t change much or are carefully managed. Where China’s central bank sets interest rates also isn’t a good gauge of growth, because most large Chinese banks are state-owned entities whose lending is driven by policy goals rather than profit motives.

One official measure of China’s unemployment rate has hovered between 3.5% and 4.5% for the last 15 years, a pattern that has led many economists to conclude it is unreliable. About two years ago, China began publishing an unemployment rate for urban areas derived from a labor survey that authorities said was more accurate. It recently showed a higher reading of 5.3%, but has also moved in a fairly tight range.

Authorities have defended their data. Earlier this year, after China reported stronger-than-expected GDP growth, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics said the state wasn’t ironing out economic fluctuations. In August, another representative of the body said its survey of the country’s labor force was relatively reliable, scientific and accurate.

Generally speaking China’s data has captured some degree of slowdown, though sometimes later than private measures. But government efforts to keep the economy from cratering, such as infrastructure spending, lending and other stimulus, can obscure areas of weakness or smooth headline growth numbers. As a result, they often don’t capture what companies are seeing on the ground, independent economists say.

That has left the door open for dozens of proprietary data providers who are competing for a growing field of financial and multinational clients, global central banks and government agencies around the world. They face a challenging task given China’s vast and diverse economy where labor conditions, incomes and business activity levels vary widely between modern cities, manufacturing hubs and swaths of rural areas.


Companies that sense the economy isn’t doing so well are adjusting their strategies. American apparel company Brooks Brothers Group Inc. is expanding in China, but after detecting weaker retail sentiment in conversations with mall operators and in customer traffic and tourist numbers, the chain is in some cases setting up shop in smaller spaces instead of larger stores.

“There has been some softening,” said Andy Lew, president of Brooks Brothers’ international division.

London-based research firm Capital Economics has its own gauge of Chinese economic growth constructed from measures such as the amount of property floor space under construction, electricity output, freight and passenger traffic, and seaport volumes. “The problem is not a lack of data but more the quality,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, its Singapore-based senior China economist.

The firm’s index, called the China Activity Proxy, has shown growth below official figures for the past seven years. It recently indicated an expansion rate of around 5.7% due in part to stronger construction activity. But electricity production—a proxy for heavy industry—has slumped and credit growth remains weak, supporting the idea that parts of the economy aren’t doing well.


In July, China reported 4.8% year-over-year growth in industrial output, its slowest pace in 17 years. A large multinational company had seen the signs much earlier.

Eaton Corp. , a global manufacturer of electrical components and power systems for buildings, industrial facilities, planes and other machinery, has about $2 billion sales in China. Last year, its in-house index showed 2.7% industrial production growth while China’s official reading was above 5% over the course of 2018. The company’s index estimated 2.5% growth for the first half of 2019.

The index was constructed by a team of in-house economists about a decade ago, when Eaton noticed demand in its markets was weaker than Beijing’s growth numbers, said its former chief economist Jim Meil. The index was built from Chinese data combed from domestic sources that included automotive sales, steel production and construction activity, Mr. Meil said.


SpaceKnow tracks about 6,000 industrial locations in China and analyzes data on night-light luminosity and infrared bands—indicators of heat produced by electricity or factories—from about half those sites roughly every two weeks. It produces a proprietary index that has become a leading Chinese PMI indicator used by hedge funds, central banks and policy makers, said CEO Jeremy Fand.

“You can see factories suddenly go quiet, giant subdivisions, huge construction projects just get halted,” said Mr. Fand. In August, SpaceKnow’s index pointed to a slight expansion, coming close to official figures that analysts said reflected a pickup in production before more U.S. tariffs came into effect.

Mr. Fand said the company is also working on a project for a U.S. government agency that is trying to analyze the impact of U.S. tariffs on China’s economy and certain industries.

Last December, U.S. exchange operator Nasdaq Inc. bought an alternative-data business called Quandl Inc. Bill Dague, a data scientist leading alternative research at Quandl, has traveled to China in recent months to hunt for new data sets for clients.

“Because it is so hard to get data out of China, demand has surpassed supply,” he said, adding that escalating U.S.-China tensions have made domestic data vendors less willing to share information with U.S. companies.

Quandl’s data includes satellite images of aluminum stockpiles and containers of concentrate sitting outside Chinese smelters and storage facilities before and after the U.S. imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese aluminum in March 2018.


Before the duties took effect, geospatial images indicated factories were ramping up aluminum production. By the summer of that year, the stockpiles had run down and the production supplies weren’t replenished at many smelters, indicating slower production and slackening demand weeks before it was reflected in Chinese government data.

George Mussalli, who oversees research and investments at Boston-based PanAgora Asset Management Inc., said one metric he monitors yearly is a “Spring Festival Index” produced by Chinese web-search giant Baidu Inc. PanAgora is a quantitative investment fund that uses data, mathematical and computer models to develop trading strategies.

Baidu’s index is compiled from the number of people who use its search engine to find information about travel and transportation options around the weeklong festival, which coincides with Lunar New Year. During that period, millions of workers embark on long commutes from big industrial cities to rural areas in central China to spend the holiday with their families.


One index showed a drop in the number of people searching about travel for a weeklong spring festival this year.

This year’s festival took place in early February, and the index showed a 12% drop in the number of people searching about travel in contrast to the previous year. Mr. Mussalli said the lower reading was a sign of slower economic activity.

“In years where factories expect less production, some of the workers go home and stay home,” Mr. Mussalli said.

China’s automotive sector, which makes up about a 10th of GDP, has been in a slump since late 2018. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the organization that puts out official sales numbers and forecasts, had earlier estimated that 2019 sales would be flat year on year. In the first seven months of the year, they fell 12.8%. Despite that, the official forecast is now for a 5.4% full-year decline.

Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch are less optimistic. They forecast a 3.6% drop in car sales at the start of 2019 and now expect a 12% drop for the year.

Ming Hsun Lee, a Hong Kong-based autos analyst at the bank, has been using data from a domestic vendor that collects weekly numbers from companies on production levels, sales to dealers and retail car sales. He said he uses it to calculate inventory levels at manufacturers, and considers price discounts, government stimulus and other factors in developing his forecast.

Mr. Pratt at AVX, the U.S. electronics component maker, said the company has been using the bank’s data to help gauge demand and adjust production. “We don’t use what the government says because they are always really protective of their automotive industry,” he said.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"What is Quant Networks Blockchain Operating System, Overledger? And why are Enterprises adopting it at mass scale?","Overledger is the world’s first blockchain operating system (OS) that not only inter-connects blockchains but also existing enterprise platforms, applications and networks to blockchain and facilitates the creation of internet scale multi-chain applications otherwise known as mApps.

In less than 10 months since launching Overledger they have provided interoperability with the full range of DLT technologies from all the leading Enterprise Permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger, R3’s Corda, JP Morgan’s Quorum, permissioned variants of Ethereum and Ripple (XRPL) as well as the leading Public Permissionless blockchains / DAGs such as Bitcoin, Stellar, Ethereum, IOTA and EOS as well as the most recent blockchain to get added Binance Chain. In addition, Overledger also connects to Existing Networks / Off Chain / Oracle functionality and it does all of this in a way that is hugely scalable, without imposing restrictions / requiring blockchains to fork their code and can easily integrate into existing applications / networks by just adding 3 lines of code.

&amp;#x200B;

# What is a blockchain Operating system?

You will be familiar with Operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS, Google’s Android etc but these are all Hardware based Operating Systems. Hardware based Operating Systems provide a platform to build and use applications that abstracts all of the complexities involved with integrating with all the hardware resources such as CPU, Memory, Storage, Mouse, Keyboard, Video etc so software can easily integrate with it. It provides interoperability between the Hardware devices and Software.

Overledger is a Blockchain Operating System, it provides a platform to build and use applications that abstracts all of the complexities involved with integrating with all the different blockchains, different OP\_Codes being used, messaging formats etc as well as connecting to existing non-blockchain networks. It provides interoperability between Blockchains, Existing Networks and Software / MAPPs

# How is Overledger different to other interoperability projects?

Other projects are trying to achieve interoperability by adding another blockchain on top of existing blockchains. This adds a lot of overhead, complexity, and technical risk. There are a few variants but essentially they either need to create custom connectors for each connected blockchain and / or require connected chains to fork their code to enable interoperability. An example of the process can be seen below:

User sends transaction to a multi sig contract on Blockchain A, wait for consensus to be reached on Blockchain A

A custom connector consisting of Off Chain Relay Nodes are monitoring transactions sent to the smart contract on Blockchain A. Once they see the transaction, they then sign a transaction on the Interoperability blockchain as proof the event has happened on Blockchain A.

Wait for consensus to be reached on the Interoperability Blockchain.

The DAPP running on the Interoperability Blockchain is then updated with the info about the transaction occurring on Blockchain A and then signs a transaction on the Interoperability blockchain to a multi sig contract on the Interoperability Blockchain.

Wait for consensus to be reached on the interoperability Blockchain.

A different custom connector consisting of Off Chain Relay Nodes are monitoring transactions sent to the Smart Contract on the Interoperability Blockchain which are destined for Blockchain B. Once they see the transaction, they sign a transaction on Blockchain B. Wait for consensus to be reached on Blockchain B.

https://preview.redd.it/2apm3pb5wel31.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7027514706d7b12690b1be8f4f4af7cfc9c43354

Other solutions require every connecting blockchain to fork their code and implement their Interoperability protocol. This means the same type of connector can be used instead of a custom one for every blockchain however every connected blockchain has to fork their code to implement the protocol. This enforces a lot of restrictions on what the connected blockchains can implement going forward.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4axzxx57wel31.png?width=1561&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8c3de8468ef9b67bc1db75cffbef81ef8c0aa70

Some problems with these methods:

* **They add a lot of Overhead / Latency**. Rather than just having the consensus of Blockchain A and B, you add the consensus mechanism of the Interoperability Blockchain as well.
* **Decentralisation / transaction security is reduced**. If Blockchain A and Blockchain B each have 1,000 nodes validating transactions, yet the Interoperability Blockchain only has 100 nodes then you have reduced the security of the transaction from being validated by 1000 to validated by 100.
* **Security of the Interoperability Blockchain must be greater than the sum of all transactions going through it**. JP Morgan transfer $6 Trillion every day, if they move that onto blockchain and need interoperability between two Permissioned blockchains that have to connect via a public Interoperability blockchain, then it would always have to be more costly to attack the blockchain than the value from stealing the funds transacted through the blockchain.
* **Imposes a lot of limitations on connected blockchains to fork their code** which may mean they have to drop some existing functionality as well as prevent them from adding certain features in the future.
* **Creates a single point of failure** — If the Interoperability blockchain or connector has an issue then this affects each connected blockchain.
* **It doesn’t scale and acts as a bottleneck.** Not only does building complex custom connectors not scale but the Interoperability blockchain that they are forcing all transactions to go through has to be faster than the combined throughput of connected blockchains. These Interoperability blockchains have limited tps, with the most being around 200 and is a trade off between performance and decentralisation.

# But some Interoperability blockchains say they are infinitely scalable?

If the interoperability blockchain is limited to say 200 tps then the idea is to just have multiple instances of the blockchain and run them in parallel, so you benefit from the aggregated tps, but just how feasible is that? Lets say you want to connect Corda (capable of 2000+ tps) to Hyperledger (capable of up to 20,000 tps with recent upgrade). (Permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger and Corda aren’t one big blockchain like say Bitcoin or Ethereum, they have separate instances for each consortium and each is capable of those speeds). So even when you have just 1 DAPP from one consortium that wants to connect Corda to Hyperledger and use 2000 tps for their DAPP, you would need 100 instances of the Interoperability blockchain, each with their own validators (which maybe 100–200 nodes each). So, 1 DAPP would need to cover the costs for 100 instances of the blockchain and running costs for 10,000 nodes…This is just one DAPP connected to one instance of a two permissioned blockchains, which are still in the early stages. Other blockchains such as Red Belly Blockchain can achieve 440,000 tps, and this will surely increase as the technology matures. There is also the added complexity of then aggregating the results / co-coordinating between the different instances of the blockchain. Then there are the environmental concerns, the power required for all of these instances / nodes is not sustainable.

It’s not just transactions per second of the blockchain as well, its the latency of all these added consensuses along the path to reach to the destination and not knowing whether the security of each of the hops is sufficient and can be trusted. To see examples of how this potential issue as well as others effect Cosmos you can see my article [here](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/cosmos-an-early-in-depth-analysis-at-the-ecosystem-of-connected-blockchains-part-two-2d5a9886166). I recommend also reading a blog done by the CEO of Quant, Gilbert Verdian, which explains how Overledger differs [here](https://medium.com/@gverdian/how-overledger-differs-from-interoperability-blockchains-97fff3094ff8) as well as detailed in the whitepaper [here](https://www.quant.network/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Quant_Overledger_Whitepaper-Sep.pdf).

# Overledger’s approach

In 1973 Vint Cerf invented the protocol that rules them all: [TCP/IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_model). Most people have never heard of it. But it describes the fundamental architecture of the internet, and it made possible Wi-Fi, Ethernet, LANs, the World Wide Web, e-mail, FTP, 3G/4G — as well as all of the inventions built upon those inventions.

&gt;\*\*\*Wired: So from the beginning, people, including yourself, had a vision of where the internet was going to go. Are you surprised, though, that at this point the IP protocol seems to beat almost anything it comes up against?\*\*\**Cerf: I’m not surprised at all because we designed it to do that.This was very conscious. Something we did right at the very beginning, when we were writing the specifications, we wanted to make this a future-proof protocol. And so the tactic that we used to achieve that was to say that the protocol did not know how — the packets of the internet protocol layer didn’t know how they were being carried. And they didn’t care whether it was a satellite link or mobile radio link or an optical fiber or something else.We were very, very careful to isolate that protocol layer from any detailed knowledge of how it was being carried. Plainly, the software had to know how to inject it into a radio link, or inject it into an optical fiber, or inject it into a satellite connection. But the basic protocol didn’t know how that worked.And the other thing that we did was to make sure that the network didn’t know what the packets had in them. We didn’t encrypt them to prevent it from knowing — we just didn’t make it have to know anything. It’s just a bag of bits as far as the net was concerned.We were very successful in these two design features, because every time a new kind of communications technology came along, like frame relay or asynchronous transfer mode or passive optical networking or mobile radio‚ all of these different ways of communicating could carry internet packets.We would hear people saying, ‘The internet will be replaced by X25,’ or ‘The internet will be replaced by frame relay,’ or ‘The internet will be replaced by APM,’ or ‘The internet will be replaced by add-and-drop multiplexers.’Of course, the answer is, ‘No, it won’t.’ It just runs on top of everything. And that was by design. I’m actually very proud of the fact that we thought of that and carefully designed that capability into the system.*

This is the approach Quant have taken with their Blockchain OS, Overledger to solve Blockchain interoperability. Compared to other Interoperability platforms that are trying to achieve interoperability at the transaction layer by connecting two blockchains via another blockchain, these will be ultimately be made redundant once faster methods are released. Overledger is designed to be future proof by isolating the layers so it doesn’t matter whether it’s a permissioned blockchain, permissionless, DAG, Legacy network, POW, POS etc because it abstracts the transaction layer from the messaging layer and runs on top of blockchains. Just as the Internet wasn’t replaced by X25, frame relay, APM etc, Overledger is designed to be future proof as it just runs on top of the Blockchains rather than being a blockchain itself. So, if a new blockchain technology comes out that is capable of 100,000 TPS then it can easily be integrated as Overledger just runs on top of it.

Likewise, with protocols such as HTTPS, SSH etc these will also emerge for blockchains such as ZK-Snarks and other privacy implementations as well as other features made available, all will be compatible with Overledger as its just sitting on top rather than forcing their own implementation for all.

It doesn’t require blockchains to fork their code to make it compatible, it doesn’t add the overhead of adding another blockchain with another consensus mechanism (most likely multiple as it has to go through many hops). All of this adds a lot of latency and restrictions which isn’t needed. The developer can just choose which blockchains they want to connect and use the consensus mechanisms of those blockchains rather than forced to use one.

Overledger can provide truly internet scale to meet whatever the demands may be, whether that be connecting multiple red belly blockchains together with 440,000 tps it doesn’t matter as it doesn’t add its consensus mechanism and uses proven internet scale technology such as that based on Kubernetes, which is where each task is split up into a self-contained container and each task is scaled out by deploying more to meet demand. Kubernetes is what runs Google Search engine where they scale up and down billions of containers every week.

Due to this being more of a summary, I strongly recommend you read [this article](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-networks-overledger-part-two-the-layers-of-overledger-ea23a7148af1) which goes into detail about the different layers in Overledger.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6x7tjq9jwel31.png?width=1126&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52ac5b9ebb45908ef6070d2eed6d107d380da1df

# But how does it provide the security of a blockchain if it doesn’t add its own blockchain?

This is often misunderstood by people. Overledger is not a blockchain however it still uses a blockchain for security, immutability, traceability etc, just rather than force people to use their own blockchain, it utilises the source and destination blockchains instead. The key thing to understand is the use of its patented technology TrustTag, which was made freely available to anyone with the Overledger SDK.

Please see [this article](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-networks-overledger-part-three-trusttag-and-the-tokenisation-of-data-71b325f4247d) which explains TrustTag in detail with examples showing how hashing / digital signatures work etc

A quick overview is if i want to send data from one blockchain to another the Overledger SDK using Trusttag will put the data through a hashing algorithm. The Hash is then included in digital signature as part of the transaction which is signed by the user’s private key and then validated through normal consensus and stored as metadata on the source blockchain. The message is then sent to the MAPP off chain. The MAPP periodically scans the blockchains and puts the received message through a hashing algorithm and compares the Hash to the one stored as metadata on the blockchain. This ensures that the message hasn’t been modified in transit, the message is encrypted and only the Hash is stored on chain so completely private, provides immutability as it was signed by the user’s private key which only they have and is stored on the blockchain for high availability and secure so that it can’t be modified, with the ability to refer back to it at any point in time.

Despite Overledger being a very secure platform, with the team having a very strong security background such as Gilbert who was chief security information officer for Vocalink (Bank of England) managing £6 trillion of payments every year and classified as national critical security (highest level you can get), ultimately you don’t need to trust Overledger. Transactions are signed and encrypted at client side, so Overledger has no way of being able to see the contents. It can’t modify any transaction as the digital signature which includes a hash of the transaction would be different so would get rejected. Transaction security isn’t reduced as it is signed at source using however many nodes the source blockchain has rather than a smaller amount of nodes with an interoperability blockchain in the middle.

# Patents

The core code of Overledger is closed source and patented, one of the recent patents can be seen [here](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=WO&amp;NR=2019106006A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=20190606&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP#), along with TrustTag and further ones are being filed. The Overledger SDK is open source and is available in Java and Javascript currently, with plans to support Pyhton and Ruby in the near future. Java and Javascript are the most popular programming languages used today.

The Blockchain connectors are also open source and this allows the community to create connectors to connect their favourite blockchain so that it can benefit from blockchain interoperability and making it available to all enterprises / developers currently utilising Overledger. Creating is currently taking around a week to implement and so far, have been added based upon client demand.

# Multi Chain Applications (MAPPs)

Multi Chain Applications (MAPPs) enable an application to use multiple blockchains and interoperate between them. Treaty Contracts enable a developer to build a MAPP and then change the underlying blockchain it uses with just a quick change of couple of lines of code. This is vital for enterprises as it’s still early days in Blockchian and we don’t know which are going to be the best blockchain in the future. Overledger easily integrates into existing applications using the Overledger SDK by just adding 3 lines of code. They don’t need to completely rewrite the application like you do with the majority of other projects and all existing java / javascript apps on Windows / Mobile app stores / business applications etc can easily integrate with overledger with minimal changes in just 8 minutes.

# Treaty Contracts

What Overledger will allow with Treaty contracts is to use popular programming languages such as Java and create a smart contract in Overledger that interacts with all of the connected blockchains. **Even providing Smart contract functionality to blockchains that don’t support them such as Bitcoin.** This means that developers don’t have to create all the smart contracts on each blockchain in all the different programming languages but instead just create them in Overledger using languages such as Java that are widely used today. If they need to use a different blockchain then it can be as easy as changing a line of code rather than having to completely rewrite the smart contracts.

Overledger isn’t a blockchain though, so how can it trusted with the smart contract? A Hash of the smart contract is published on any blockchain the MAPP developer requires and when called the smart contract is run its run through a hashing function to check that it matches the Hash value stored on the blockchain, ensuring that it has not been modified.

By running the Smart contract off chain this also increases Scalability enormously. With a blockchain all nodes have to run the smart contract one after another rather than in parallel. Not only do you get the performance benefit of not having to run the code against every single node but you can also run them in parallel to others executing smart contracts.

You can read more about Treaty Contracts [here](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-networks-overledger-part-four-features-overledger-provides-to-mapps-ade5d3d3b613)

# The different versions of Overledger

## Enterprise version

The current live version is the Enterprise version as that is where most of the adoption is taking place in blockchain due to permissioned blockchains being preferred until permissionless blockchains resolve the scalability, privacy and regulatory issues. Please see [this article](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-networks-overledger-part-eight-enabling-enterprise-mass-adoption-f0e0e41363ab) which goes into more details about Entereprise blockchain / adoption. The Enterprise version connects to permissioned blockchains as well as additional features / support suited for Enterprises.

## Community version

The community version is due to be released later this year which will allow developers to benefit from creating MAPPs across permissionless blockchains. Developers can publish their MAPPs on the MAPP Store to create additional revenue streams for developers.

# Where does Overledger run from? Is it Centralised?

Overledger can run from anywhere. The community version will have instances across multiple public clouds, Enterprises / developers may prefer to host the infrastructure themselves within a consortium which they can and are doing. For example SIA is the leading private Financial Network provider in Europe, it provides a dedicated high speed network which connects all the major banks, central banks, trading venues etc. SIA host Overledger within their private network so that all of those clients can access it in the confinement of their heavily regulated, secure, fast network. AUCloud / UKCLoud host Overledger in their environment to offer as a service to their clients which consist of Governments and critical national infrastructure.

For Blockchain nodes that interact with Overledger the choice is entirely up to the developer. Each member within a consortium may choose to host a node, some developers may prefer to use 3rd party hosting providers such as Infura, or Quant can also host them if they prefer, its entirely their choice.

Overledger allows for higher levels of decentralisation by storing the output across multiple blockchains so you not only benefit from the decentralisation of one blockchain but the combination of all of them. Ultimately though decentralisation is thrown around too much without many actually understanding what it means. It’s impossible to have complete decentralisation, when you sign a transaction to be added to a blockchain ultimately you still connect through a single ISP, connect through a single router, or the input into a transaction is done through a piece of software etc. What matters to be decentralised is where trust is involved. As i have mentioned before you don’t need to trust the OS, it’s just providing instructions on how to interact with the blockchains, the end user is signing the transactions / encrypting at client side. Nothing can be seen or modified with the OS. Even if somehow the transaction did get modified then it would get rejected when consensus is done as the hash / digital signature won’t match at the destination blockchain. Where the transaction actually gets put onto the blockchain is where decentralisation matters, because thats what needs to be trusted and conensus is reached and Overledger enables this to be written across multiple blockchains at the same time.

# The Team

The team are very well connected with a wealth of experience at very senior roles at Global enterprises which I will include a few examples below. Gilbert Verdian the CEO was the Head of security for the payment infrastructure for the Bank of England through his CISO role with Vocalink (Mastercard)managing £6 trillion every year. This is treated by the government as critical national infrastructure which is the highest level of criticallity because its so fundamental to the security of the country. They have experience and know what it takes to run a secure financial infrastructure and meeting requirements of regulators. Gilbert was director for Cybersecurity at PWC, Security for HSBC and Ernst &amp; Young as well as various government roles such as the CISO for the Australian NSW Health, Head of Security at the UK government for Ministry of Justice and HM Treasury in addition to being part of the committee for the European Commission, US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.

Cecilia Harvey is the Chief Operating Officer, where she was previously a Director at HSBC in Global Banking and Markets and before that Director at Vocalink. Cecilia was also Chief Operating Officer at Citi for Markets and Securities Services Technology as well as working for Barclays, Accenture, IBM and Morgan Stanley.

Vijay Verma is the Overledger platform lead with over 15 years of developer experience in latest technologies like Java, Scala, Blockchain &amp; enterprise technology solutions. Over the course of his career, he has worked for a number of prestigious organisations including J&amp;J, Deutsche, HSBC, BNP Paribas, UBS Banks, HMRC and Network Rail.

Guy Dietrich, the managing director of Rockefeller Capital (manages $19 Billion in assets) has joined the board of Quant Network, and has recently personally attended meetings with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with Gilbert

As well as advisors such as Paolo Tasca, the founder and Executive Director of the Centre for Blockchain Technologies (UCL CBT) at University College Londonfounder and executive director as well as Chris Adelsbach, Managing Director at [Techstars](http://www.techstars.com/), the worldwide network that helps entrepreneurs succeed. Techstars has partners such as Amazon, Barclays, Boeing, Ford, Google, Honda, IBM, Microsoft, PWC, Sony, Target, Total, Verizon, Western Union etc.

Due to client demand they are expanding to the US to setup a similar size office where board members such as Guy Dietrich will be extremely valuable in assisting with the expansion.

The most exciting part about the project though is just how much adoption there has been of the platform, from huge global enterprises, governments and cloud providers they are on track for a revenue of $10 million in their first year. I will go through these in the next article, followed by further article explaining how the Token and Treasury works.

personalfinance,Am I being lied/manipulated to by my lender?,"Ok, so I'm a new home owner. I have a 30 year FHA loan fixed at 4.6X% and I have lived here for just over a year.

I called my lender a few months ago to ask about some end of year tax stuff. The person answered my questions and then was like 'Hey, I'm looking at your file here, and you might be able to lower your interest rate.' And I was like 'I'm interested. Let's look into it.' So he ran the numbers and said that I could get 4.1X% interest rate and save ~$300 a month. So we moved ahead with this new loan which I was told would replace the old loan.

So I get transferred to someone in the loan Dept. And they are working on my loan. They run the numbers and come up with the same figures, and so we move ahead. I'm getting updates and so far everything seemed to be matching the numbers I was initially quoted.

A few days ago I saw there were updates to my loan application. So I check it out. Now, under ""estimated monthly payment"" the total (which previously matched the total I was initially quoted) is actually $5 higher than what I currently pay. 

Can anyone explain this? How is it possible that I have a lower interest rate, and all the same insurance and escrow and pay $5 more? Am I being manipulated so the mortgage company can rack up some closing fees, and stick me with an identical (ish) loan and resting the age of my loan (back to 30 years instead of 29)?

Update #1: thanks everyone for the response. I was actually able to find the older copy of the loan estimate and it looks like a lot of the additional cost is in the ""initial escrow payment at closing"" section of the estimate so I am hoping that it will only be that high for the payment at closing. I am going to try to talk with the mortgage company today to sort it out. Wish me luck. Closing isn't for two weeks so I'm hoping that I can still cancel the load application with minimal lose if I need to.


Update #2: I talked to the lender and it turns out the initial figures they have me were missing some local taxes. I still felt like this was just an excuse b c I am paying those taxes already and my loan is at a higher interest rate, and my current payment it's still less than the monthly payment on the new loan. I rescinded the application, and that was the end of it.

Thanks again to everyone who responded!

And why are Enterprises adopting it at mass scale?","Overledger is the world’s first blockchain operating system (OS) that not only inter-connects blockchains but also existing enterprise platforms, applications and networks to blockchain and facilitates the creation of internet scale multi-chain applications otherwise known as mApps.

In less than 10 months since launching Overledger they have provided interoperability with the full range of DLT technologies from all the leading Enterprise Permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger, R3’s Corda, JP Morgan’s Quorum, permissioned variants of Ethereum and Ripple (XRPL) as well as the leading Public Permissionless blockchains / DAGs such as Bitcoin, Stellar, Ethereum, IOTA and EOS as well as the most recent blockchain to get added Binance Chain. In addition, Overledger also connects to Existing Networks / Off Chain / Oracle functionality and it does all of this in a way that is hugely scalable, without imposing restrictions / requiring blockchains to fork their code and can easily integrate into existing applications / networks by just adding 3 lines of code.

# What is a blockchain Operating system?

You will be familiar with Operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS, Google’s Android etc but these are all Hardware based Operating Systems. Hardware based Operating Systems provide a platform to build and use applications that abstracts all of the complexities involved with integrating with all the hardware resources such as CPU, Memory, Storage, Mouse, Keyboard, Video etc so software can easily integrate with it. It provides interoperability between the Hardware devices and Software.

Overledger is a Blockchain Operating System, it provides a platform to build and use applications that abstracts all of the complexities involved with integrating with all the different blockchains, different OP\_Codes being used, messaging formats etc as well as connecting to existing non-blockchain networks. It provides interoperability between Blockchains, Existing Networks and Software / MAPPs

# How is Overledger different to other interoperability projects?

Other projects are trying to achieve interoperability by adding another blockchain on top of existing blockchains. This adds a lot of overhead, complexity, and technical risk. There are a few variants but essentially they either need to create custom connectors for each connected blockchain and / or require connected chains to fork their code to enable interoperability. An example of the process can be seen below:

User sends transaction to a multi sig contract on Blockchain A, wait for consensus to be reached on Blockchain A

A custom connector consisting of Off Chain Relay Nodes are monitoring transactions sent to the smart contract on Blockchain A. Once they see the transaction, they then sign a transaction on the Interoperability blockchain as proof the event has happened on Blockchain A.

Wait for consensus to be reached on the Interoperability Blockchain.

The DAPP running on the Interoperability Blockchain is then updated with the info about the transaction occurring on Blockchain A and then signs a transaction on the Interoperability blockchain to a multi sig contract on the Interoperability Blockchain.

Wait for consensus to be reached on the interoperability Blockchain.

A different custom connector consisting of Off Chain Relay Nodes are monitoring transactions sent to the Smart Contract on the Interoperability Blockchain which are destined for Blockchain B. Once they see the transaction, they sign a transaction on Blockchain B. Wait for consensus to be reached on Blockchain B.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q2znoy2sdfl31.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12075bd57eef24d43a8403eec5c349e084f84342

Other solutions require every connecting blockchain to fork their code and implement their Interoperability protocol. This means the same type of connector can be used instead of a custom one for every blockchain however every connected blockchain has to fork their code to implement the protocol. This enforces a lot of restrictions on what the connected blockchains can implement going forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rko07t8tdfl31.png?width=1561&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a925f3cf7ed20f1d3230f8b07b10189b3293ffa

 

Some problems with these methods:

* **They add a lot of Overhead / Latency**. Rather than just having the consensus of Blockchain A and B, you add the consensus mechanism of the Interoperability Blockchain as well.
* **Decentralisation / transaction security is reduced**. If Blockchain A and Blockchain B each have 1,000 nodes validating transactions, yet the Interoperability Blockchain only has 100 nodes then you have reduced the security of the transaction from being validated by 1000 to validated by 100.
* **Security of the Interoperability Blockchain must be greater than the sum of all transactions going through it**. JP Morgan transfer $6 Trillion every day, if they move that onto blockchain and need interoperability between two Permissioned blockchains that have to connect via a public Interoperability blockchain, then it would always have to be more costly to attack the blockchain than the value from stealing the funds transacted through the blockchain.
* **Imposes a lot of limitations on connected blockchains to fork their code** which may mean they have to drop some existing functionality as well as prevent them from adding certain features in the future.
* **Creates a single point of failure** — If the Interoperability blockchain or connector has an issue then this affects each connected blockchain.
* **It doesn’t scale and acts as a bottleneck.** Not only does building complex custom connectors not scale but the Interoperability blockchain that they are forcing all transactions to go through has to be faster than the combined throughput of connected blockchains. These Interoperability blockchains have limited tps, with the most being around 200 and is a trade off between performance and decentralisation.

# But some Interoperability blockchains say they are infinitely scalable?

If the interoperability blockchain is limited to say 200 tps then the idea is to just have multiple instances of the blockchain and run them in parallel, so you benefit from the aggregated tps, but just how feasible is that? Lets say you want to connect Corda (capable of 2000+ tps) to Hyperledger (capable of up to 20,000 tps with recent upgrade). (Permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger and Corda aren’t one big blockchain like say Bitcoin or Ethereum, they have separate instances for each consortium and each is capable of those speeds). So even when you have just 1 DAPP from one consortium that wants to connect Corda to Hyperledger and use 2000 tps for their DAPP, you would need 100 instances of the Interoperability blockchain, each with their own validators (which maybe 100–200 nodes each). So, 1 DAPP would need to cover the costs for 100 instances of the blockchain and running costs for 10,000 nodes…This is just one DAPP connected to one instance of a two permissioned blockchains, which are still in the early stages. Other blockchains such as Red Belly Blockchain can achieve 440,000 tps, and this will surely increase as the technology matures. There is also the added complexity of then aggregating the results / co-coordinating between the different instances of the blockchain. Then there are the environmental concerns, the power required for all of these instances / nodes is not sustainable.

 It’s not just transactions per second of the blockchain as well, its the latency of all these added consensuses along the path to reach to the destination and not knowing whether the security of each of the hops is sufficient and can be trusted. To see examples of how this potential issue as well as others effect Cosmos you can see my article [here](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/cosmos-an-early-in-depth-analysis-at-the-ecosystem-of-connected-blockchains-part-two-2d5a9886166). I recommend also reading a blog done by the CEO of Quant, Gilbert Verdian, which explains how Overledger differs [here](https://medium.com/@gverdian/how-overledger-differs-from-interoperability-blockchains-97fff3094ff8) as well as detailed in the whitepaper [here](https://www.quant.network/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Quant_Overledger_Whitepaper-Sep.pdf).

# Overledger’s approach

In 1973 Vint Cerf invented the protocol that rules them all: [TCP/IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_model). Most people have never heard of it. But it describes the fundamental architecture of the internet, and it made possible Wi-Fi, Ethernet, LANs, the World Wide Web, e-mail, FTP, 3G/4G — as well as all of the inventions built upon those inventions.

&gt;***Wired: So from the beginning, people, including yourself, had a vision of where the internet was going to go. Are you surprised, though, that at this point the IP protocol seems to beat almost anything it comes up against?***  
*Cerf: I’m not surprised at all because we designed it to do that.*  
*This was very conscious. Something we did right at the very beginning, when we were writing the specifications, we wanted to make this a future-proof protocol. And so the tactic that we used to achieve that was to say that the protocol did not know how — the packets of the internet protocol layer didn’t know how they were being carried. And they didn’t care whether it was a satellite link or mobile radio link or an optical fiber or something else.*  
*We were very, very careful to isolate that protocol layer from any detailed knowledge of how it was being carried. Plainly, the software had to know how to inject it into a radio link, or inject it into an optical fiber, or inject it into a satellite connection. But the basic protocol didn’t know how that worked.*  
*And the other thing that we did was to make sure that the network didn’t know what the packets had in them. We didn’t encrypt them to prevent it from knowing — we just didn’t make it have to know anything. It’s just a bag of bits as far as the net was concerned.*  
*We were very successful in these two design features, because every time a new kind of communications technology came along, like frame relay or asynchronous transfer mode or passive optical networking or mobile radio‚ all of these different ways of communicating could carry internet packets.*  
*We would hear people saying, ‘The internet will be replaced by X25,’ or ‘The internet will be replaced by frame relay,’ or ‘The internet will be replaced by APM,’ or ‘The internet will be replaced by add-and-drop multiplexers.’*  
*Of course, the answer is, ‘No, it won’t.’ It just runs on top of everything. And that was by design. I’m actually very proud of the fact that we thought of that and carefully designed that capability into the system.*

This is the approach Quant have taken with their Blockchain OS, Overledger to solve Blockchain interoperability. Compared to other Interoperability platforms that are trying to achieve interoperability at the transaction layer by connecting two blockchains via another blockchain, these will be ultimately be made redundant once faster methods are released. Overledger is designed to be future proof by isolating the layers so it doesn’t matter whether it’s a permissioned blockchain, permissionless, DAG, Legacy network, POW, POS etc because it abstracts the transaction layer from the messaging layer and runs on top of blockchains. Just as the Internet wasn’t replaced by X25, frame relay, APM etc, Overledger is designed to be future proof as it just runs on top of the Blockchains rather than being a blockchain itself. So, if a new blockchain technology comes out that is capable of 100,000 TPS then it can easily be integrated as Overledger just runs on top of it.

Likewise, with protocols such as HTTPS, SSH etc these will also emerge for blockchains such as ZK-Snarks and other privacy implementations as well as other features made available, all will be compatible with Overledger as its just sitting on top rather than forcing their own implementation for all.

It doesn’t require blockchains to fork their code to make it compatible, it doesn’t add the overhead of adding another blockchain with another consensus mechanism (most likely multiple as it has to go through many hops). All of this adds a lot of latency and restrictions which isn’t needed. The developer can just choose which blockchains they want to connect and use the consensus mechanisms of those blockchains rather than forced to use one.

Overledger can provide truly internet scale to meet whatever the demands may be, whether that be connecting multiple red belly blockchains together with 440,000 tps it doesn’t matter as it doesn’t add its consensus mechanism and uses proven internet scale technology such as that based on Kubernetes, which is where each task is split up into a self-contained container and each task is scaled out by deploying more to meet demand. Kubernetes is what runs Google Search engine where they scale up and down billions of containers every week.

Due to this being more of a summary, I strongly recommend you read [this article](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-networks-overledger-part-two-the-layers-of-overledger-ea23a7148af1) which goes into detail about the different layers in Overledger.

&amp;#x200B;

# But how does it provide the security of a blockchain if it doesn’t add its own blockchain?

This is often misunderstood by people. Overledger is not a blockchain however it still uses a blockchain for security, immutability, traceability etc, just rather than force people to use their own blockchain, it utilises the source and destination blockchains instead. The key thing to understand is the use of its patented technology TrustTag, which was made freely available to anyone with the Overledger SDK.

Please see [this article](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-networks-overledger-part-three-trusttag-and-the-tokenisation-of-data-71b325f4247d) which explains TrustTag in detail with examples showing how hashing / digital signatures work etc

A quick overview is if i want to send data from one blockchain to another the Overledger SDK using Trusttag will put the data through a hashing algorithm. The Hash is then included in digital signature as part of the transaction which is signed by the user’s private key and then validated through normal consensus and stored as metadata on the source blockchain. The message is then sent to the MAPP off chain. The MAPP periodically scans the blockchains and puts the received message through a hashing algorithm and compares the Hash to the one stored as metadata on the blockchain. This ensures that the message hasn’t been modified in transit, the message is encrypted and only the Hash is stored on chain so completely private, provides immutability as it was signed by the user’s private key which only they have and is stored on the blockchain for high availability and secure so that it can’t be modified, with the ability to refer back to it at any point in time.

Despite Overledger being a very secure platform, with the team having a very strong security background such as Gilbert who was chief security information officer for Vocalink (Bank of England) managing £6 trillion of payments every year and classified as national critical security (highest level you can get), ultimately you don’t need to trust Overledger. Transactions are signed and encrypted at client side, so Overledger has no way of being able to see the contents. It can’t modify any transaction as the digital signature which includes a hash of the transaction would be different so would get rejected. Transaction security isn’t reduced as it is signed at source using however many nodes the source blockchain has rather than a smaller amount of nodes with an interoperability blockchain in the middle.

# Patents

The core code of Overledger is closed source and patented, one of the recent patents can be seen [here](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=WO&amp;NR=2019106006A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=20190606&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP#), along with TrustTag and further ones are being filed. The Overledger SDK is open source and is available in Java and Javascript currently, with plans to support Pyhton and Ruby in the near future. Java and Javascript are the most popular programming languages used today.

The Blockchain connectors are also open source and this allows the community to create connectors to connect their favourite blockchain so that it can benefit from blockchain interoperability and making it available to all enterprises / developers currently utilising Overledger. Creating is currently taking around a week to implement and so far, have been added based upon client demand.

# Multi Chain Applications (MAPPs)

Multi Chain Applications (MAPPs) enable an application to use multiple blockchains and interoperate between them. Treaty Contracts enable a developer to build a MAPP and then change the underlying blockchain it uses with just a quick change of couple of lines of code. This is vital for enterprises as it’s still early days in Blockchian and we don’t know which are going to be the best blockchain in the future. Overledger easily integrates into existing applications using the Overledger SDK by just adding 3 lines of code. They don’t need to completely rewrite the application like you do with the majority of other projects and all existing java / javascript apps on Windows / Mobile app stores / business applications etc can easily integrate with overledger with minimal changes in just 8 minutes.

# Treaty Contracts

What Overledger will allow with Treaty contracts is to use popular programming languages such as Java and create a smart contract in Overledger that interacts with all of the connected blockchains. **Even providing Smart contract functionality to blockchains that don’t support them such as Bitcoin.** This means that developers don’t have to create all the smart contracts on each blockchain in all the different programming languages but instead just create them in Overledger using languages such as Java that are widely used today. If they need to use a different blockchain then it can be as easy as changing a line of code rather than having to completely rewrite the smart contracts.

Overledger isn’t a blockchain though, so how can it trusted with the smart contract? A Hash of the smart contract is published on any blockchain the MAPP developer requires and when called the smart contract is run its run through a hashing function to check that it matches the Hash value stored on the blockchain, ensuring that it has not been modified.

By running the Smart contract off chain this also increases Scalability enormously. With a blockchain all nodes have to run the smart contract one after another rather than in parallel. Not only do you get the performance benefit of not having to run the code against every single node but you can also run them in parallel to others executing smart contracts.

You can read more about Treaty Contracts [here](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-networks-overledger-part-four-features-overledger-provides-to-mapps-ade5d3d3b613)

# The different versions of Overledger

## Enterprise version

The current live version is the Enterprise version as that is where most of the adoption is taking place in blockchain due to permissioned blockchains being preferred until permissionless blockchains resolve the scalability, privacy and regulatory issues. Please see [this article](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-networks-overledger-part-eight-enabling-enterprise-mass-adoption-f0e0e41363ab) which goes into more details about Entereprise blockchain / adoption. The Enterprise version connects to permissioned blockchains as well as additional features / support suited for Enterprises.

## Community version

The community version is due to be released later this year which will allow developers to benefit from creating MAPPs across permissionless blockchains. Developers can publish their MAPPs on the MAPP Store to create additional revenue streams for developers.

# Where does Overledger run from? Is it Centralised?

Overledger can run from anywhere. The community version will have instances across multiple public clouds, Enterprises / developers may prefer to host the infrastructure themselves within a consortium which they can and are doing. For example SIA is the leading private Financial Network provider in Europe, it provides a dedicated high speed network which connects all the major banks, central banks, trading venues etc. SIA host Overledger within their private network so that all of those clients can access it in the confinement of their heavily regulated, secure, fast network. AUCloud / UKCLoud host Overledger in their environment to offer as a service to their clients which consist of Governments and critical national infrastructure.

For Blockchain nodes that interact with Overledger the choice is entirely up to the developer. Each member within a consortium may choose to host a node, some developers may prefer to use 3rd party hosting providers such as Infura, or Quant can also host them if they prefer, its entirely their choice.

Overledger allows for higher levels of decentralisation by storing the output across multiple blockchains so you not only benefit from the decentralisation of one blockchain but the combination of all of them. Ultimately though decentralisation is thrown around too much without many actually understanding what it means. It’s impossible to have complete decentralisation, when you sign a transaction to be added to a blockchain ultimately you still connect through a single ISP, connect through a single router, or the input into a transaction is done through a piece of software etc. What matters to be decentralised is where trust is involved. As i have mentioned before you don’t need to trust the OS, it’s just providing instructions on how to interact with the blockchains, the end user is signing the transactions / encrypting at client side. Nothing can be seen or modified with the OS. Even if somehow the transaction did get modified then it would get rejected when consensus is done as the hash / digital signature won’t match at the destination blockchain. Where the transaction actually gets put onto the blockchain is where decentralisation matters, because thats what needs to be trusted and conensus is reached and Overledger enables this to be written across multiple blockchains at the same time.

# The Team

The team are very well connected with a wealth of experience at very senior roles at Global enterprises which I will include a few examples below. Gilbert Verdian the CEO was the Head of security for the payment infrastructure for the Bank of England through his CISO role with Vocalink (Mastercard)managing £6 trillion every year. This is treated by the government as critical national infrastructure which is the highest level of criticallity because its so fundamental to the security of the country. They have experience and know what it takes to run a secure financial infrastructure and meeting requirements of regulators. Gilbert was director for Cybersecurity at PWC, Security for HSBC and Ernst &amp; Young as well as various government roles such as the CISO for the Australian NSW Health, Head of Security at the UK government for Ministry of Justice and HM Treasury in addition to being part of the committee for the European Commission, US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.

Cecilia Harvey is the Chief Operating Officer, where she was previously a Director at HSBC in Global Banking and Markets and before that Director at Vocalink. Cecilia was also Chief Operating Officer at Citi for Markets and Securities Services Technology as well as working for Barclays, Accenture, IBM and Morgan Stanley.

Vijay Verma is the Overledger platform lead with over 15 years of developer experience in latest technologies like Java, Scala, Blockchain &amp; enterprise technology solutions. Over the course of his career, he has worked for a number of prestigious organisations including J&amp;J, Deutsche, HSBC, BNP Paribas, UBS Banks, HMRC and Network Rail.

Guy Dietrich, the managing director of Rockefeller Capital (manages $19 Billion in assets) has joined the board of Quant Network, and has recently personally attended meetings with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with Gilbert

As well as advisors such as Paolo Tasca, the founder and Executive Director of the Centre for Blockchain Technologies (UCL CBT) at University College Londonfounder and executive director as well as Chris Adelsbach, Managing Director at [Techstars](http://www.techstars.com/), the worldwide network that helps entrepreneurs succeed. Techstars has partners such as Amazon, Barclays, Boeing, Ford, Google, Honda, IBM, Microsoft, PWC, Sony, Target, Total, Verizon, Western Union etc.

Due to client demand they are expanding to the US to setup a similar size office where board members such as Guy Dietrich will be extremely valuable in assisting with the expansion.

The most exciting part about the project though is just how much adoption there has been of the platform, from huge global enterprises, governments and cloud providers they are on track for a revenue of $10 million in their first year. I will go through these in the next article, followed by further article explaining how the Token and Treasury works.

So I switched to discover, but discover just lowered theirs to 1.9% so now I'm looking for another place. However, the whole ordeal of opening, transferring all my money($5000), and then having to do it, again and again, is stressing me out. Is this normal for such fluctuations? I admit I am completely new to all this but I would like to just have my money sit and earn. If this is the price I gotta pay to get a nice interest rate I'll put up with it, but if there's a more efficient way to do this that would be less stressful then I would appreciate some advice. I feel like every day I'm looking at interest rates.",finance

personalfinance,Best loan for medium income and okay/bad credit?,"My Fiancé and I are quickly approaching the end of our lease on our current residence. We currently pay $950 a month for a 2 bed / 2 bath town home in central/eastern KY. We would like to buy, but we are unsure of which sort of loan we should be looking at.

I was under the impression that I will qualify for my VA loan come January, when I ETS from the Guard. I will have had 6 years in when I ETS. I’ve been told however, that guardsmen do not receive their VA loan until they complete their IRR portion. In my case, this is an additional 2 years. 

We are in an area which ~1/2 of the proprieties would qualify for a USDA loan. 

I have okay credit, in the neighborhood of 650, which will continue to improve between now and when we are able to buy. I recently purchased a vehicle (March 19), and have also recently opened 2 lines of store credit for furniture. My fiancé does not have very good credit, approximately a 500 score. We have considered her filing bankruptcy to handle some significantly outstanding debt.

We both make decent money, ~50k/yr each. We have 1 child together and she has 2 of her own. Since we are not married, the kids receive medical cards. We plan on getting married but are waiting until it makes better economic sense to do so. 

My DTI ratio, including a 30 year loan for ~190k with an average interest rate, would be sitting at right around 40%

I have looked into the HomeReady loans which appear to allow for us to use her income despite not being on the loan. We ran into issues with her poor credit back when we were trying to purchase a vehicle. I would likely be right on the cutoff of qualifying as “low income” per the HomeReady guidelines for my area. 

Does anyone have advice regarding which type of loan would be best? Does anyone, preferably national guard, have experience with VA loans? Are there other types of loans out there which may be better suited to meet our needs?",finance
personalfinance,Is this a sound plan moving forward?,"So looking for some thoughts on doing a cash out refinance of my home. 

Both my wife and I work full time.  However, my wife is currently staying home with our two kids (2 yrs &amp; 3 mos) until January 2020 at which point she will be going back to work full time. Taking this time off is partially un-paid, so her salary is approximately 60% until September 2020 as they prorated her contract for the year.  Together we make about $150,000 gross (when she is at full contract pay). I'm going to be getting a small raise (\~$5k) in January 2020, then another raise of \~$1500/yr annually for the next 7yrs as part of a promotion I just got at work.

Debts right now are:

* Current home loan  $169,100 at 3.625% - About a $1240/mo payment including property tax, escrow etc. I pay an even $1300/mo because I like round numbers. Zillow on our house is $372k, but considering our remodel, other upgrades on the property, and the neighborhood we live in (its growing fast) I think $380-400k is a realistic appraisal.
* HELOC: $53,993 at 5.25% variable  &lt;&lt; this was used to  remodel the entire lower level of our home almost 3 years ago among  some other upgrades before our first child was born. Expensive, but zero regrets.
* 5th wheel trailer: $19,109 at 4.99%
* Credit  card: $5,000 at 0% &lt;&lt; I opened this prior to the birth of our second child. I'm on track to have it paid off by December this year.   0% APR is good through June 2020.
* HVAC Loan: $3,952 at 0% &lt;&lt; HVAC went out a couple years ago (go figure right after the remodel) and we ended up replacing the A/C and Furnace.
* Auto Loan: $30,839 at 3.44% &lt;&lt; Purchased this vehicle now that we have two kids as we needed the space for car seats etc.  I am now commuting in her paid off compact car and parked my paid for diesel truck (which we use to pull our trailer) saving approximately $200/mo in fuel.

My thought process here is to take advantage of the lower interest rates, and refinance our home pulling out enough extra to pay off our HELOC, and 5th Wheel (approximately $75k) since they are both higher rates than what I'm seeing available right now (3.3-4%) which would start over our 30yr fixed mortgage, but also mean I could apply the money we are paying to these debts separately towards the mortgage.  We have zero plan to move from this area any time in the next 10yrs as we like the school system etc. for our kids, and love our home, so starting over the term doesn't bother me.

Does this seem like a solid plan? Or am I missing something?  My overall goal is to consolidate these bigger debts into the house. Pay off the credit card, then HVAC since they are smaller debts (even though they are at 0%) then tackle the car so we would be left with just a mortgage within about 2-3yrs from now.  At that point I could throw as much extra/mo towards the mortgage but my required minimum payment for it would be far less than what we are paying meaning I'd have more cash flow liquidity for unknown expenses (car break downs, etc.) moving forward.

This might be more of a blend of advice, but it certainly relates to personal finance, so I figured it was applicable (especially with all the bright minds in here). Some background, I am 22 years old, in my last semester of my undergrad, and have a full time job lined up after I graduate making $24 an hour. I bring home about $1100 in my paychecks (bi-weekly). I have lived with my parents my whole life, and while I planned to continue to live with them after graduating to save up money, a few recent trips down town to where my friends live has really got me itching to move out, along with increased tensions at my current home. 

My current situation: I do not pay for my phone bill, and I have my car completely paid off. I pay insurance (about $90 a month), that is really the only monthly expense I have. I currently have $8,000 in the bank and no credit card debt. 

I am looking in the Baltimore area, Federal Hill or Fells point. Most 2 bedroom places are around $1500 or so a month. I would be splitting it with a roommate, so rent and utilities would probably look something like $800 a month. I guess I am just looking for advice on whether or not in my current situation if moving out is feasible. This next portion is more of an advice thing, but this whole time I've been putting my finances first and being frugal, and never thought to move out simply for that reason. but, I think the quality of my life would improve so much, so that's what is really making me think about this. 

Any advice at all would be AWESOME, many thanks .",finance
personalfinance,Exempt question on W-4,"Hey all,

I'm going to be starting a new job soon and I've actually only had one other career in my life so I haven't really had to make out new paperwork in forever. Sorry if this is a dumb question but if someone could just help me:

So for the W-4 form, I know that I want to put 0 because I'd rather they take all of the taxes out of me so I can just get my refund next year and don't owe anything. But at the bottom it asks if you want to be exempt. I don't want to right? Is that only if you want to keep more of the federal taxes, or something? I tried looking it up but I just saw websites saying the differences between exempt and non-exempt employees (and I'd be non-exempt as far as I'm aware, since I can get payed over time, etc). So I don't really understand it. 

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Questions about auto refinancing,"I purchased a new 2018 Mazda3 in February at an interest rate of 4.39% for a term of 72 months.  I've been researching refinancing recently and wanted to get some input.  I've aggressively paid it down, and can bring it to about $10,000 owed in relatively short order.  I hate to see so much money going toward interest, so I want to see what I can do to save some money in the end.

I found [this Regions Bank article](https://www.regions.com/Insights/Personal/Auto/Buying-or-selling-a-car/four-questions-to-consider-before-refinancing-auto-loan) on considerations before moving forward.  For #1, the first 3 bullet points apply. I don't have any concerns about #2 (great score, amount owed less than car value, and on-time payments).  

For #3, I'll actually be shortening the term, which will increase monthly payments by about $60, which I can more than handle (been paying $50 - $100 extra per month already).  I'll have to check to see if there's any early termination fees, but I know there's no pre-payment penalties.  That third bullet point though ... 

&gt; Refinancing your auto loan may change or void any warranties, service contracts, or other related products that may not be covered under a new loan

Will I need to contact the dealer to ensure that my new-car warranty (standard, didn't buy the extra stuff) doesn't somehow get voided? 

Doing some research on refinancing, I found [Pentagon Federal](https://www.penfed.org/auto/refinance), which offers 2.49% on a 36 month refinance term.  That seems pretty good - any others that I might be eligible for with lower rates?  Any experience with PenFed to recommend or warn against their services?

Besides Regions' 4 points, are there any other considerations I should look into before moving forward?  I know I read about the potential for a title transfer fee - [etags.com suggests it shouldn't be any more than $40 for this in Ohio](https://www.etags.com/blog/title-transfer/ohio/) - does that seem about right?

One last question - is there any easy way to calculate the difference in interest if I worked toward paying off the existing loan in 36 months vs refinancing and paying off at PenFed in the same time?  I don't know if this is the right way to go about it, but using [a loan calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/auto/auto-loan-calculator.aspx), I plugged in $10,000 @ 36 months with the rates of 2.49% vs 4.39% and got total interest paid to be $389 and $691 respectively.  Subtracting those numbers, I get about $300 - so it seems that I might save $300 by switching?",finance

personalfinance,"My ex-wife is filing for Bankruptcy, and its screwing me over.","My ex and I got a divorce 2 years ago. Was a fairly harmless split financially, we decided to pay off all our debts except her car (which was in her name), and split what was left in our joint account down the middle.  

The joint account was in my name originally, but we added her later on. We applied as a co-sign for a line of credit on the account itself as a form of overdraft protection, as well as an actual credit card. When we split, I took over this account completely, as well as the credit lines. I removed her name from the account entirely, and she chopped up all her cards in front of me, but the credit lines still had her name on it. She was fine with this for a while, as it affected her credit positively. I barely used the card until recently. Get to that in a moment. 

Turn the time twister forward two years, and I get an email from her saying she is filing for Article 7 (I think thats the name) Bankruptcy, and that this would be affecting the line of credit and credit card that her name was still on. The issue here is, I'm about to move across the country in less than a month, and had planned on using the card as a bit of a buffer to help with the move. I had just barely paid off half of the debt I built up on the card due to not working the last 2 years (Depression is a bitch folks, get help). There is about 2500 on the card left over from an eye surgery I got shortly after the divorce, with a max of 7500. The bank I have the card through won't just remove her, they say I have to re-apply for the card under just my name, and move the balance over to the new card in order to remove her name. 

Issue here is, like I said above I havent been working much. So my eligibility for a card at a comparable max value AND interest rate (its currently at 11%) is very unlikely. Not to mention I've heard that cancelling your longest standing credit line makes you take a big hit to your credit score (which this particular card I've had for almost a decade now). 

Not really sure where to go from here. I have about a month before the courts and judges here process through all of her Bankruptcy paperwork and it lands on the bank's desks from her Lawyer. After the move, I should be working more and be in a better place to make payments on the card, but if the card doesn't exist and I end up owing it all to the bank at once, what then?

Any advice here would be great. Kinda at my wits end with trying to figure out how to proceed.

TL:DR My ex and I still share a credit line in name, but only I use/have access to it. She is filing for Bankruptcy, and its going to kill the card, which I am still using and need for a big move across the country.",finance

financialindependence,My one year FIRE update. Hint: It's awesome.,"Six month update can be found here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ayen19/my_first_six_months_of_fire/

TLDR: I FIREd one year ago and man, has this year gone by quickly. The plan worked and while it’s been a wonderful time I did have some surprises along the way.

**A Brief Recap**

I’m not using a throwaway account and my identity is easy to discover so I won’t be using any actual figures. Suffice to say I’m on the fat side of FIRE but by most definitions, it’s pretty low on the Fat scale.

I had a 25 year career in television news in NYC. My income was higher than average but in no way close to some of the software engineers or doctors on this sub. In my six month update someone guessed my income was 200k and another person suggested it was 500-600k. I never got close to 200k and neither did my wife. 

The original plan was that my wife and I would retire at the same time but since she likes her job and can do it from anywhere, she continues to work. At any time she can decide to stop working and the plan stays the same.

Major events in our lives that helped us FIRE started with a literal fire. In 1997 my wife’s house burned down and we were able to turn tragedy into triumph by investing the insurance money as we rebuilt the house. I have two rental properties. I’m trying to sell one at the NJ shore now but there isn’t really demand for three unit rentals. Oversized single family homes, however, are selling for ridiculous prices.

Although frowned upon (or worse) on this sub we have owned a timeshare for 20 years and loved it while working. It’s been even better now that we can travel more. Went to Utah in April and are planning to go to Arizona in November and Colorado in January or February. In Oct. of 2020 we’re going to Hawaii.

**Labor Day**

This had a lot of significance for me through the years. When I was a kid it meant going back to school after spending the summer at my parent’s vacation home / rental property at the Jersey Shore. As an adult it meant that the long weekends I’d take were over and it was back to a regular schedule. Now that I live here at the Jersey Shore for six months, it means I watch all my friends do those things and I enjoy the weather, the boat, Waverunner, paddle boarding, and running on the boardwalk without any of the crowds that were here in the summer. Labor day used to be an end to something now it’s the beginning of something new as I prepare to go back to CA for six months.

**First Year Observations**

I wanted this year to be a test for what life will be like going forward. We wanted to watch our spending carefully and live as frugally as possible just to make sure we had everything right. I avoided big ticket items. The golf cart that came with the house we bought in CA needed to have all the batteries replaced at a cost of around $900 or we needed to buy a replacement golf cart, probably $3,500. When I was working it would have been an easy decision – buy a new one. I did nothing and will decide what to do when I return to CA next month. Since our spending was good, I’m leaning toward a new one but some big expenses are coming up. One of the air conditioning units broke at our house in CA but rather than fix it, I’m also waiting until we return in October.

My rental in CA is going well and my excellent tenant wants to stay another year. He did ask for some big ticket items like having a retractable awning installed on the patio and replacing the curtains with blinds or shutters. I’ll probably add the awning since it will increase the property value but not the window treatments.

The biggest surprise for me was that our eating out budget was way more than I thought it would be and not in the place I thought. I figured we’d go out to eat a lot more when we’re living in CA since we have lots more retired friends there. It turns out we just have dinner at different friend’s houses. In NJ since our kitchen is small and family and friends visit on the weekends, we’ve gone out a lot more than expected. It won’t break the budget but it was surprising. I’m surprised how much we spend at our local microbreweries but that’s where we hang out with most of our friends so it’s money well spent – and the beer rocks.

**Lifestyle inflation**

In my 6 month update I mentioned that I believe that some lifestyle inflation is not only inevitable, but necessary for a happy life while you pursue FIRE. My biggest lifestyle splurge was my boat. I thoroughly enjoy it and was willing to pay for that experience. Unfortunately after only four years my boat had a major engine issue that would have cost $10,000 to fix but luckily it was under warranty. Now I’m looking at new boats – we’ll see if that’s in the budget. 

**Getting FIRE Right**

My key takeaway after a year out of work is that perfect planning and perfect execution are impossible. I split my time between the two highest tax states – that definitely wasn’t perfect planning. The good news is that you can be pretty far from perfect but still succeed. I've literally had people on this sub call me an idiot or stupid for things I’ve done. For instance I’m not an advocate of maxing 401k or IRA at the expense of not investing in a taxable account. I never maxed those accounts myself. Now that I’m retired I don’t have to worry about a 72t, I just withdraw from my taxable brokerage. I use a version of the three bucket method and was told it’s just a mind trick and doesn’t really do anything for you. That’s fine but it’s a mind trick that works for me – no need for perfection just success.

**The Retirement Reality**

We pinch ourselves and ask “how is this possible” on a daily basis. During the winter months we live in a gated community in southern CA with the most [stunning mountain views](https://i.imgur.com/JVlmHza.jpg) you could ask for and we live at the beach with an awesome boat and waverunner to enjoy on a daily basis in the summer months. I had [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/Tq5rPLN.jpg) hanging in my office when I was working and now this is my life. It was definitely worth it. We’re members at and play tennis where the largest non-major tennis tournament is held in Indian Wells. Here’s [Roger Federer practicing.](https://i.imgur.com/MbYxOpM.jpg)

I was surprised that I didn’t do nearly as much hiking as I thought I would and I plan on changing that once we get back to CA. 

In my previous update I said that I’d lost 40 pounds and compete in half marathons and now triathlons. Well, I came in second place in my age group at a trail half marathon in Utah and my wife came in first in her age group at the same race. 

I had a crazy mishap at what would have been my second triathlon this summer. I got chemical burns to both my corneas from the anti-fog spray I used on my goggles. I was basically blind for two days and it took over a week for my eyesight to return to normal. I’ve already signed up to do that tri again next year, not letting anything keep me down.

Another six months past and we have not been bored for one second. As a matter of fact, I haven’t even had time to read a book (though I am writing another one).

personalfinance,"Depreciation on a rental property, need help","Hi guys, I need your help in figuring out the best way moving forward. I have a property that i wanted to rent out. Market value of the property 200-215k$. Bought it 7 years ago for 65k, put 50k in repairs and upgrades over years ( mainly own labor plus some help here and there). Now just to break it down to finances:
80k owned on first mortgage (285$/month mortgage cost/servicing the loan)
90k on heloc (480$/month heloc financial charges/servicing load)

Insurance 80$/month.
Rental income 1500$/month ( if you are lucky maybe you can rent it out at 1900$/month at the peak season, well not this time though :).  )
It would seem to me that there will be no taxable income after tax and mortgage/ heloc and insurance.

personalfinance,Need advice on which loan to pay off first.,"The past couple years I've paid off about $20k in high interest loans. The end is in sight and I should have them paid off in a couple years. I've finally gotten to the whale accounts, 2 separate student loans.

1. $25k, 5.61% ($400/mo), refinanced because Sallie Mae was killing me
2. $48k, various ($580/mo)

Loan 2 is also a student loan, so it's actually a bunch of different loans grouped together. But the interest rate on each of those loans is lower than Loan 1(each is 4% or less). 
I've just been doing what Mint tells me to do for the loan payoff goal I set up. I guess it goes by the avalanche method and tells me to pay off Loan 1 first because it has a higher rate than the others. But I started thinking that with Loan 2 being nearly twice as large would it make sense to pay that down first(or a least a portion of it)?

Edit: I might mention that I also have an extra $800/mo allocated towards this goal on top of the minimum payments above.",finance

I am looking to start out selling covered calls. I had 285 vested shares of my company, say XYZ, in the former and just enough cash to buy 15 more XYZ in the later.

Last week, on Friday, I had them move all of my vested stock to individual brokerage and I bought 15 shares on my own in the individual brokerage (called as just account from now on). With 300 shares available, I sold 3 covered calls that with expiry a week out from that Friday (I’ve since learned not to take such risks). Fast forward to Monday, I get 2 separate emails from E*TRADE:

Your account is currently in a margin call requiring immediate action: Call amount $9740

Your account is currently in a Fed call requiring immediate action: Call amount:	$9965.00

Notice these amounts are not the exact same.

1. Will depositing the highest amount into the account meet both requirements or do I need to add them and deposit (I have enough cash to cover both, without duress)

2. What’s a handy way to calculate this requirement in the future?

3. The stock jumped a couple points today, still under my strike price, should I expect about get margin margin email tomorrow?

4. I should also note that I made these transactions of stock purchase and selling calls separately. Nowhere did I get to specify that the 3 calls are covered by -these- 300 shares. Did I miss something?

- benefits just a little better and just a little cheaper (4% 401k match)

- will also sponsor for clearance

- no certs provided

- job might be more stressful as it’s an AT&amp;T/ Bell Labs legacy company, and I’ve worked for another of those companies (Avaya) and know what the culture in those places can be like

- likely won’t get own office or even a window for any natural light

- the work is in providing cellular technology solutions to the federal government, often cutting edge one-off solutions 


If I had received both offers at the same time, I would have most likely taken number 2 because of the better money and PTO, but since I’ve already started work for 1, it is a lot more complicated. I’ve never quit a job after a week or two before but now that extra $800 per month is very tempting since I’m behind and my debt has grown. If my finances hadn’t been destroyed that extra money wouldn’t be quite so tempting. It’s worth noting that assuming I make bonus with company 1 at the end of each year, the comp packages are so close as to not matter, but bonuses are NOT guaranteed, and I’m not making that extra money every month like I would with company 2. 

Company 1 might be the better long-term bet due to all the carts they’re going to pay for me to get. 

Although company 2 might be the better bet vis a vis lifetime earnings (they always say don’t shortchange yourself). 

It’s worth mentioning that while I was unemployed this summer, I took a minimum wage second job at Starbucks, and that’s a little over 20 hours per week, and I can bring home about $800 per month doing that. It’s not sustainable in the long run to work both jobs and also be there for my family. The magnitude of the raise I’d be turning down with company 2 is the entirety of what I can earn being a barista. That’s the equivalent of a lot of sacrifice. 

Last thing I’ll mention is that my wife is also a working professional, makes about $65k plus small bonus.

personalfinance,Accidentally Paid Bonus,"As the title states, I was accidentally paid a $XX,XXX retention bonus by my employer.  I recently took a leave of absence and the bonus was paid on our originally agreed timeline (Fall 2019), instead of the amended schedule which reflects my temporary departure (Spring 2020).  This bonus represents about 20% of my annual pre-tax salary.  I’m already in the top tax bracket without the payment.  

I reported this to my company and they have rightly requested I pay it back.  However, I’m concerned that I’m going to get screwed when tax time comes.  The company has requested I pay back the final amount I received in my bank account - not including ESPP or 401k contributions.  I’ve asked for them to do the calculations again to double check that their request is correct and they maintain it is.  The final amount I received in cash was 42% of the gross. 

A few questions:

1)  33% was withheld for taxes but I’m not sure this is sufficient.  20% was for federal, 9% for CA state, and the rest was for social security / Medicare / etc.  I used an online tax calculator and it showed that my federal taxes should be about 36% and CA state should be about 16%. Does that sound right?  I don’t want to owe the IRS for money I’ve paid back come tax time. 

2)  What paperwork and documentation should I request from my employer?  I read that they will be submitting a W2 correction to CA Dept of Revenue and the IRS but I’m not sure if I have any reporting responsibility. 

3)  Are there any other ways I can get screwed over from this transaction?

personalfinance,"Fucked up my leg, Which fucked up my life and now getting a call from the ""Feds""",[removed],finance
personalfinance,"Messed up my leg, Which Screwed up my life and now getting a call from the ""Feds""","Hey guys,

So let me give you a little bit of backstory just so all this makes sense and to provide the most information I can. I was 19 at the time, 20 now. I'm from Missouri but in August of 2018 I moved to Jersey City, New Jersey to start school in Manhattan. Fast forward to October 7th 2018. I was on my way to sign my lease for my new apartment in Brooklyn when on the ride to the train station where I fucked up my ankle while trying to do an Ollie. To use the medical terms and shit for it I had a Left Bimalleolar Ankle Fracture and a Left Syndication Injury. Basically I broke the sides of my ankle tore a little bit of tendants in my ankle along with ripping 6 inch's of the tendants in between my fibula and tibia. Along with fracturing and shattering several bones along the way. Get to the hospital. After being there for 4 days I finally go in for surgery. Everything went smoothly.

Now here is were money comes into play. So my hospital bill all together cost 70,000. I did not have insurance since I lost my medicare once I turned 18 and I had to wait another month till I qualified for insurance through my work. Thankfully by the grace of god, someone stole my wallet two weeks prior so I had to change my pay stubs to show my new jersey address to get a new ID and Open a new bank account since my current one was a small Missouri bank that I could barely use. That new Address made me a citizen of Jersey so I qualified for some care act that payed for 56,000 of that bill. So I had 14,000 around left to pay.

Being fresh to a city with barely any money, and now being unable to work or let alone move for months. I had to go back home to my family in Missouri (I used the down payment to my apartment to pay for the flight back) This left me with 200 dollars to my name, No Job, No Insurance, and really no home. I was thankful enough that my family Fed me, payed my phone bill, and payed for the 100 dollar check ups for the doctor every two weeks. But with those visit was about 4 75 dollar bills for x-rays every visit. Racking up a good chunk of change after months of visits. This whole time I had been trying to get qualified for Missouri insurance but since me changing all my addresses to my New Jersey Address. I no longer qualified for most of Missouri care benefits or charity's from my hospital since I was not a Missouri Citizen. So it wasn't until this past month I was actually able to qualify and be accepted.

Now I'm sure there is many options that I could have taken to figure some of this out and help my situation. But During my recovery time I was severely Depressed. I'v been diagnosed with a Severe Case of Bi Polar my whole life along with a bad case of OCD and mild ADHD. So this whole situation made all of that crash into me like an atomic bomb. So during this whole process I have been struggling to get past all that shit.

After about 4 months I finally started to walk again. After another 2 to 3 months I was full weight bearing. Then another month after that I was finally able to be using my leg with full movement I ran into a snag. A screw in my leg that had broken was now tugging on the ligaments (Might have been a Tendant hell Idk the difference) that grew back in between my fibula and tibial. This basically felt like the whole metal bar was trying to be ripped out of my leg if I was on it for more than an hour or 5 minutes of literally any cardio workout. So had to wait until July for everything to be completely healed so I could go in for another surgery.

My Mental Health had been on a very very bad decline to the point I was no longer myself. So in June I finally broke down and went into In Patient just to get on some meds. This whole experience though so far is about 8,000 dollars (Still getting different bills in so could be more

But in the Beginning of July I finally go in for my surgery to get all the metal taken out in my leg (Besides two screws.) It took about a week before I could put all my weight on it again. But instantly my mood changed and started feeling like myself again so that's a plus. I finally got my leg back ya know. But that surgery cost me 9,000 roughly.

So to bring all of this together. This whole time I was jobless and had no income coming in. I had not payed ANY of these bills because I'v had the plan on applying for bankruptcy. I'm working 1 full time job now and about to start another so I can get all of this figured out before hand. So roughly I owe around 32,000 of medical bills plus a 1,000 dollar credit card bill on top of it. I'v been keeping a close eye on my credit report checking to see if anythings coming up so I can talk to people if I absolutely need too. The only things that has shown is the 8 of the 75 dollar x-rays along with 2,250 bill for the anesthesiologist from Jersey City. Nothing else has arisen and I have a 6 month deadline with those to pay those so I should be able to get to them in time. To my knowledge I can't be criminally charged with Medical bills but they can DESTROY my credit. Maybe court summonsed told to pay them as well. The only thing I can be crimanlly charge with is the credit card bill yet nothing has shown on my credit report along with I'v been in contact with the company of that card. I'v really been trying to keep an eye on it all and haven't seen those things happen.

But today I got a call saying ""Grand Jury, for a Federal Criminal Offense. This is our last attempt to reach you. Call \_\_\_\_ bank numbers."" It didn't state why or who and it was done by a robot and seems sketchy as shit. I haven't received any other notices from a government on anything through mail or call. So Out of all this shit I'm just trying to figure out. Where do I go from here

\-P.S.A. Sorry if this doesn't really belong here didn't know where else to post all of this and my questions.

personalfinance,Refinanced my student loan debt less than a year ago and rates have dropped a whole point. Is there any downside to refinancing a second time?,"This is pretty self explanatory based on the title, but some details on this:

Last November I refinanced about \~51,000 dollars of **private** student loan debt after getting ass blasted by Sallie Mae for 4 years while in school. Mistakes were made, but I definitely got in under control after that. My current rate is fixed at **5.62% over 10 years.** Less than one year into that I have managed to bring down the principal about $4,000 based on a few sporadic overpayments when my budget allows.

With a lot of talk about a 'recession' looming I figured it might be a good idea to make sure my rates are as low as possible before they *potentially* skyrocket if financial downturn was imminent. I have lived in TX for over a year now and am eligible to refinance with Brazos who offers fixed rate at **4.3% over 10 years**.

My minimums between private and federal loans is $898/month - no issue with making the payments so far and while I know you cannot predict the future; I do not see myself as unemployed or employed at a salary less than what I currently make over the next ten years.

(a) Is it smart to refinance again even though I did less than a year ago?

(b) I know that if I include my federal loans (\~30k) in a second refinance I will lose any potential PSLF or IBR; but has anyone does this under the assumption they may not use these programs? Or just for peace of mind?

Thanks in advance, friends!

investing,Does the Fed Raising Interest Rates Affect Corporate Bonds and Bond Funds?,"Hello!

I'm still fairly new to investing, and have recently been researching bonds and bond funds, and the factors that go into investing in them.  I know the concept that when interest rates rise, bond prices fall.  I also know that the Federal interest rate is currently super low, therefore the only place it can really make meaningful moves is to be raised.  

My question is: does the Fed raising the interest rates on government bonds impact corporate bonds and bond funds directly?  Or do they move more independently from the government issued bonds?  I.e. if I were to invest in a corporate bond fund today, and the Fed increased the interest rates tomorrow, would my bonds immediately lose value?

personalfinance,"21 years old, no debt, some savings, need help for next steps/options","(Sorry about the formatting, I'm posting from mobile)

So I've always considered myself penny wise with my money, but when it comes to the larger pictures of finance and economics, it's pretty easy to tell that I'm dollar stupid - or at the very least, dollar uneducated. 

Right now I am in my third year of university. I have no debts whatsoever (and plan to stay that way), and I get a stipend from the school that, after all is said and done, amounts to about 7k a semester that goes straight into my bank account. I work part-time on the weekends that gets me around $300~$350 every two weeks. Financially speaking, I am completely independent; I was fortunate enough to get my mother's old car, but other than that I pay for my own living expenses and rent without assistance. My goal currently is to have 0 debt and 10k in savings by the time I graduate, which doesn't account for working over summer and is, quite frankly, not a hard goal to reach at all. So here's my dilemma:

1. 10k is a lot for someone my age, especially so when it's not straddled by debt; however, it's still pennies to dollars in the larger scale. Should I aim for higher, even it means compromising my quality of life currently?

2. Credit. I don't have a credit card yet, and I'm not sure where to even start, or what my options are.

3. Interest. Currently I am at 5k out of my 10k goal in hard savings (9k before projected rent subtractions), and recently my roommate has tried to sell me on savings account with high interest rates. Sounds good, but I'd definitely like to learn more about the terms and conditions, and again, the options available to me.

Those are my three questions currently. Any extra tips are, of course, appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"So I want to buy a house, but have 40k in student loans. Is this a bad idea?","I did a little searching on here to avoid a redundant question, but didn't quite get the answer to my question. The title is generally self explanatory. 

Renting sucks. I feel like I'm throwing money in the garbage while renting the lower half of a 4 bedroom house for more than what the cost of a mortgage would probably end up being in this area. Housing prices where I live are pretty amazing, from what I understand about real estate. I could easily buy a 5 or 6 bedroom house that only needs cosmetic changes/repairs for under 100k. I can apply for first time homeowner programs in both my city, state, and federally that might cover a full 20% down payment - in addition to my parents wanting to chip in a significant amount to help with down payment/closing costs, or renovations. 

I've read that it's suggested not to try to buy a house or anything while you still have student loans - but it seems stupid to me to throw away money while renting when I could put any extra money I spend on savings/loans toward homebuying costs, and then potentially turn my new home into an income earning property by having a few roommates while I also live in it - thus eliminating any mortgage/rent expense and even covering other general living costs depending on how many roommates I have. Finding roommates won't be a huge challenge thanks to there being about 10 different colleges within a 30 mile radius of the city I live in.

&amp;#x200B;

My current financial situation is as follows:

Gross annual salary of 29,120 - with roughly 3,500 in overtime, and an estimate of 7-8k in side hustle income. 

Monthly fixed expenses of rent- $795, student loans - $520, utilities - $75 and internet - $50 (parents generously cover car and phone payment). I currently only \*have\* to pay 220 a month toward loans - I've been putting an extra 300 for a total of 520 a month, though.

Other monthly expenses are food - $150, pets -$75-100, gas/car maintenance - $75-100,  and all extra is ""fun"" money or goes into other savings/investment accounts.

5% of my income goes into my employer matched 401k, and roughly 7.8% is going into my HSA. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke with a mortgage originator and she gave me a very rough estimate of my max affordable mortgage being 785 a month. Ideally I'd like to aim lower and buy a less expensive house as I have to factor in taxes, maintenance, insurance, water and other house-related expenses I don't currently pay for. Only my current full time job can factor into the mortgage, as well, as the rest doesn't show up in W-2 statements or anything of that sort, but that's not an issue for me. I'm looking in the 40k-100k range for houses right now. 

I'd be applying for a SONYMA mortgage as well as a down payment assistance loan (0% interest and $0 monthly payment, and it's forgiven if you own the home for at least 10 years), and applying for the federal homebuyer dream program as well as one my city offers (HBDP gives up to $15k toward closing costs/down payment and my city gives up to $3k, both are grants).

TLDR; - Does it make sense to pay only minimum payments on loans in the short term (6-8 months) in order to move to a potentially ""free"" housing situation, and thus enable me to pay more toward loans in the future? Or am I crazy to even consider owning property while still owing student loans?",finance

Anyway, she recently had surgery and was just diagnosed with (a very treatable) cancer.

The side effect is that she's having to take a bit extra time off work that we originally anticipated and now that her pto is exhausted, her employer is requiring us to pay out of pocket for her healthcare coverage.  The cost to us is about $440 every two weeks.

Can I pay for that out of our HSA?

If we let the coverage lapse and get coverage through the marketplace, will the deductibles that we've paid this far (decent amount) carry over?

*Edit:  The $440 is for her usual part of her healthcare and dental payroll deductions.  I was not clear about that because I did not think that that was possible - I have since verified that and also reviewed planning sheets I did when we elected coverage though her company and found that I was aware of that last November (that's the month her company does it in).  The reason we didn't go with the MarketPlace is because our income was too close to a tipping point - and we expected to breach an amount that would have caused the marketplace, all things considered, to cost more than her employer coverage.*

Additional Edit:  Thank you for your responses.  I was hoping that we could continue to pay for the continuation of her coverage, while on FMLA, tax free - or, possibly, switch over to a less expensive plan without losing our deductible tally, but all that appears to be a pipe-dream.  Regardless, thank you for the help!

-------

Conclusion edit:

Health plan deductibles do not transfer.

I'm going to use our HSA to pay for our portion (employee portion) of the employer's health plan....

Hear me out.

It seems to be common knowledge that an HSA can be used to pay for COBRA - however, I noticed in my research (that I started), that the references to COBRA in government documents and cheat sheets is always listed as an example.  In fact, COBRA is continuing coverage required under federal law (and, as such, is used as the example) - and the IRC states that disbursements from an HSA are allowed for:

&gt;a health plan during any period of continuation coverage required under any Federal law - *[(Reference IRC §223(d)(2)(C)(i))](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/223)*

Note that COBRA is not mentioned, ""continuation of coverage required under **any** Federal law,"" is.

Fast forward to the [Family Medical Leave Act.](https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla).  Specifically, the legalize of it that states that the employer, ""*must* maintain the employee's coverage under any group health plan..."" *[(Reference CFR, §825.209)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=abbd92cdff37c5d32de741cc5ccc1e81&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=29:3.1.1.3.54&amp;idno=29#se29.3.825_1209)*

The above being stated, it is my position that the continuation of health plan coverage under the FMLA *does* constitute as continuation of coverage as required by Federal law for reasons that are self-evident, and as the IRC dictates under that condition, the payment of the employee's part of employer offered health plan premiums are considered a qualified medical expense as set fourth by [IRC §223(d)(2)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/223).

solar,Solar setup in the UK - pay off time is 15+ years! Is this normal?,"I’m looking at installing solar for my home in the UK. Our current electricity use is 31 kWh per month so we don’t use much power at all! I’d like to go 100% solar.

If I understand correctly that works out at a little over 1.1 kWh a day. Add a safety factor of 25% gives 1.4 kWhh. Assuming 2 hours of useable sunlight in the depths of winter that gives a solar requirement of  700W.
(700W x 2 hours of light = 1400 Wh)

Is that maths right? 

If so it seems I can get the panels for around £1,000 (without install and other parts). Adding a battery jacks the cost up - looking at the power wall it’s £7,750 so total cost for 100% solar use is £8,750 + some install costs so call it £10,000 with install and other bits and pieces. That should cover us 24/7 with some enough capacity in the battery to see us through. 

We currently pay £650 a year for power but under 100% solar we would be paying £0. So to pay off the £10,000 it would take 15.4 years. 

Am I missing something here that makes this more affordable? Currently it looks like solar works out as a worse deal than just putting the cash in a decent interest rate savings account!",energy
personalfinance,Are there some conditions under which a Cash Out Refinance is sensible?,"So I purchased a property 3.5 years ago for $245K @ 4.675% on a 30-year fixed with 20% down ($49K).    I have $180K left on mortgage.  The property has since seen an appreciation of $100K and is now valued at $345K.  Monthly payment is $1292, which includes principal, interest, property taxes and home insurance.  HOA adds another $166/mo.  So my total monthly cost is $1458.   Rent for comparable properties in my area is currently $1800/mo+.  I would like to pay off within the next 10-15 years, and it's highly do-able with additional payments towards principal.

My 3 options, as I see them, are:

1. Keep existing loan and interest rate, make extra payments towards principal and pay off the house in 10-15 years, which is about the time that I retire.
2. Refinance to a 15-year fixed @ 3.125%, which will bring my total monthly cost to $1618 (based on one estimate from one prospective lender).  That's an extra $326/mo more I'd have to pay.  I'd have to do the numbers, but it is possible that keeping my existing loan and interest rate and making extra payments could enable me to pay off the mortgage in the same amount of time, but also give me the leeway to revert to making lower payments should I need to ever do so, for whatever reason.  With the 15-year fixed, I'd not have that leeway.  So it seems that this option would only make sense if it saves me more in the long run or enables me to pay off sooner.
3. Consider a Cash Out Refinance.  Would there be a cap on how much I can cash out, or could I pull out all of my equity, including initial 20% down payment?   Would it ever make sense when you can get a loan at over 1% lower interest rate vs your original loan's interest rate?  The main reason for considering this 3rd option is not to do any home improvements (the property doesn't really need much of that at all), nor is it to finance some purchase of luxury goods (like a new car, etc); instead, the one scenario I think where it could possibly come in handy is to have cash on hand for when opportunities may arise that could lead to significant gains in my long-term financial position.  As an example, take the 2011/2012 timeframe, or around then, when property values were tanking.  2bd/2ba/2car condos were selling for $80-90K, where they normally sell for at least $180K-$270K (current high).  If I had the cash on hand to buy 1 of those units 7-8 years ago, I could have made perhaps a $160K gain over that time.   I do realize that the housing crash at that time was quite exceptional and we may or may not see a crash to that degree again in my lifetime.  As another example, I could have bought some AMD stock when it was dirt cheap and held on to it to perhaps triple my return on investment over the past 7-8 years.  I wouldn't be able to do either, at least not at a significant scale, without such cash on hand.  Admittedly, there are no guarantees and there is risk involved in each opportunity.

If someone could tell me the reasons why options 2 and 3 above would not be good ideas, by pointing out things I may not have considered, I would greatly appreciate it.",finance
investing,Fact check on interest rates,"From my understanding lower interest rates drive the spread from short term bonds and interest rates on consumer banking to lower.

investing,Central Bankers should feel bad for shilling negative rates.,"When doing to many amphetamines i sometimes become paranoid and occasionally will go on long rants, but  most times it provides clarity. One of those times i ended up [posting this](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1u262/negative_interest_rates_are_bad_and_central/), in which i point out how negative interest are pure fucking central bank autism and they don't actually help the country thats running them. 

Here's a copy paste of what i wrote:


The idea is companies can borrow at near-zero interest rates (because safe government bonds are negative yielding), they are inclined to borrow a lot while simultaneously returning money to shareholders. Those shareholders, seeing such low bond yields, will invest that money into other equities.The flaw in this theory is that it doesn't account for international capital flows.

Case in point: Japan &amp; Europe. These regions have had negative interest rates, and yet they really don't have any notable bubbles aside from *maybe* some expensive real estate (which is to be expected with 0% rates). If anything, these regions have had the cheapest equities based on traditional valuation methods.


Countries with negative rates typically go negative due to little to no growth. By introducing negative rates, this allows the companies that are not growing or not doing anything productive to stay alive simply by rolling debt continuously. It supports zombie firms in other words, which tends to prevent real economic growth.

*note: speaking of zombie firms look up the ECB bailing out the European corporate bond market and look at corporate bond ratings in europe (which fucked the people who went short). Theres a shitload of trash bonds, ie broken window fallacy on monetary Roids.*

Instead, investors in countries with low rates will simply borrow in the 0% interest rate, then move that money into a region with higher growth and yield. In other words, it just causes capital flight, deflation, and a bit of currency devaluation. The risk with these big carry trades is that when the region being invested in (take Japanese investors investing in USA) starts to perform poorly, you get big swings in capital flows, which cause the currency to rise dramatically, which then can cause some problematic unwinds.

So putting it simply, negative rates cause bubbles in other countries / regions to form unless there are intense capital controls put in place. China for example has the world's strictest capital controls for a country of its size, hence the enormous buildup in bubbles within China directly. Without capital controls, a ton of that money would just flee the border. Europe and Japan on the other hand do not have intense capital controls, so financial assets owned by them tend to be heavily foreign.

It also creates a trap, a no/low growth, low inflation, high debt trap. It destroys money markets, venture capital,  the banking sector and causes large amounts of capital flight. Sometimes it makes me wonder if central bankers forgot about the **Solow Swan Growth model** and that savings lead to growth.

I don't see a solution to it especially for european nations, other than force rates above negative, let a recession run, purge out the malinvestment, which who knows a painful and how long that will run.

 Even after that point you'd have to address government spending and debt issuance which crowds out the private sector; in the US check the IOER and feds funds rate and how it coincided with problems with dollar liquidity, which personally is my pet theory on what really pushed the federal reserve to lower rates as they were losing control of the value of money....yes I’m basically saying the fed cuts rates to provide enough liquidity to markets to then fund the federal governments deficits.....and it matches up look at which three large banks are buying all the bonds, look at which bank ceos meet with the president and the federal reserve. 

Extension of the original post: In regards to the crowding out effect; to be more specific we had Fed Funds rate going over Interest on Excess Reserves (IOER) and it stayed there for some time even with technical adjustments that where made. Now why does this matter for deficits?

In Q4 2018, primary dealer holdings of treasuries rose at a $500 to $600 billion annual rate. In short, in Q4 2018 the US government was being financed in no small part by primary dealers. Now that information is easy enough to see BUT there was a recent study done...by i think a Norwegian financial analyst ( i cant remember the name) but in the paper it showed how much the US federal government relies on the big US banks to buy treasuries, and the amounts are increasing dramatically.

Also banks are not lending into the Fed Funds because the ""excess reserves” are not really excess reserves at all. They have become required....effectively. It looks like they or their depositors have shifted cash into the treasury market either directly or indirectly (money market funds).

So fed funds over IOER is a sign that the US banking system (by extension the private sector) is running out of balance sheet capacity to finance the US government deficits. So the fed is forced to cut rates to provided needed liquidity.

financialindependence,Ikigai and FIRE - Planning for CoastFIRE &amp; Mini Retirement &amp; Mid-Career Change,"**CoastFIRE -&gt; Partial Financial Independence**

Everyone has a CoastFIRE Number .. that's the amount of money you need at a particular age to never need to save additional money for your retirement. You can ""coast in"" to retirement.

For example: If you want to retire at 60 with $1.5m, your CoastNumber would be around $400k at age 40, depending on average interest rates.

(Some people hit this number, and keep pushing to achieve more along the career they've had since graduating college. If you love your job and the opportunities it provides you, then great! Keep going!)

At CoastFIRE, you are at a major milestone in ""partially financial independence."" For the next phase of your life, you will no longer need to save money for later. You'll still need to make money, but it can essentially all be spent on your year-to-year living. If you have been saving 50% of your income, each additional year of work pays for a year of freedom (\* ok, not really, but you get the idea).

**Ikiagi: The Big Picture beyond Finances**

If you look at your life in terms of [Ikigai](https://medium.com/thrive-global/ikigai-the-japanese-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-life-might-just-help-you-live-a-more-fulfilling-9871d01992b7) .. you can ask yourself: What things am I missing in life that my focus on ""saving money"" has been preventing. There may be things that you love to do, that no one pays you for (parenting). There may be things that you want to give back to the world (volunteering). You may have all kinds of life goals whose opportunities are slowly passing you by.  You may need to focus on your health - years of stress and limited free time can wreck your body &amp; mind and cause addictions.

You may want to finally focus on things like learning, giving and personal growth, rather than income and productivity.

**CoastFIRE plus a few years: Mini Retirement and/or Career Change**

After hitting CoastFIRE, people may make changes to their career or job structure to help them explore ikigai, and find lifestyle that fills more of their needs.

Many people's dream is to find part-time work within their career, or sustainable short-term contract work. These are possible finds, but somewhat rare. Some consider BaristaFIRE, working at a cafe or similar job that people daydream of as low-stress. Though part-time work at minimum wage is basically $nothing a month.

I'm personally looking specifically simultaneously at three CoastFIRE Plans:

* Mini-retirement - being able to take six months to 1.5 years off from work
* Career change - being able to transition into a new moderately paying career over the course of 3 years
* Contingency Plan - What happens if I'm 2-3 years out, and need to return to my main career?

**Mini Retirement:**

My personal estimate is that the Mini-Retirement will cost me around $30k, for 6 to 18 months. My target is $2,500/mo, which I've traveled on less before. And these days, one of my hobbies is likely to earn me some money.

I have that $30k in cash-equivalent at the moment, no way I'm risking it in the stock market.

**Career Change**

My estimate for the total cost of the Career Change is: $0. I hope I'll break even; that all the struggles, training and hustle in year one is paid for in profit by year 3. And from then on, I'll be set in a new career that is more meaningful, less time-consuming or otherwise better for me until I hit full retirement. There's even a good chance I'll make a profit and keep bumping up my early-retire date.

At the moment, I don't even know what kind of career change I will consider. I'm taking the Mini Retirement to figure out what I want next from my career. I'm currently brainstorming, and open to experimentation. Maybe I'll teach English? What about freelancing in Tech? Could I change careers to be a Photographer? None of these questions need answers. They all have similar enough financial/risk outcomes, and as the time gets closer I can work out the details.

**Contingency Plan**

I know it'll take a few years of trying to know if I'm going to make it in a career change. Which means, I know the worst case is that I fail for around two years in a row, making little-to-no money. If that happens, I'll need to figure out how to return to my previous career.

The cost of this worst case scenario is: 2-3 years of moderate cost of living (perhaps $40k/yr), followed by up to a 1 year of career training and job hunting (perhaps another $40k+$10k).  I know my new job may not pay as much as my old one, but since I'm Coasting, it won't matter as much. At it's worst, that all comes to $130k. (For what it's worth, that's how much something like an e-MBA costs). A more realistic ""failure scenario"" is less, and may only cost $75-$100k, as I should be making some money, and keeping my cost of living low until I earn more.

**CoastFIRE + A few years: Total Cost of Mini Retirement &amp; Career Change**

With my CoastFIRE retirement money set aside, I have $100k left available. I'm a little under-funded at the moment. Ideally, I'd have $130k-$160k saved. After my mini-retirement ($30k), I'll have $70k available to fund the career shift. If I'm lucky, I won't really have to touch it. If I'm unlucky, I might have to pull a little from a retirement brokerage account to get back on my old career path.",finance

Amount I have been paying for the past 9 months = $500  
Current monthly payment = $500.00  
  
After taxes and health, vision, and dental insurance I take home $3,000 a month. I also have a part time job that I work 6 months out of the year where I make an additional $8,000 after taxes. This is not included in the $3,000. Currently I am still living at home so have no expenses besides student loans and commuting to work which is ~$400 a month. I also spend around $300 on social activities a month.  
  
I have a little over $10,000 in my savings.  
  
I pay off any bills in full every month including credit card bills. I have no credit card debt.  
  
  
Questions that I have:  
  
1). How much should I pay towards my student loans each month?  
  
2). I am debating about throwing a large chunk of cash at my student loans. Is this a good idea? If so, how much should I pay off now, and would it be better to completely pay off a $1000 loan at a medium interest rate of (4.29%) or pay $1000 towards the highest interest rate of 7.21% with a balance of $13,434?  
  
3). My company 401k starts soon to where I can choose how much I want to contribute. What percentage should I elect? My company does not match my contribution until a year from now, but when that kicks in, they match $0.50 for every dollar up to 6%.  
  
4). Should I open a money market account for my savings?  
  
5). I would also like to invest in mutual funds yearly. Where do you recommend I get started in researching this? How much should I invest, if any? I was thinking $2000 a year.  
  
6). Any other recommendations?

investing,Ford Cut to Junk by Moody's on Doubts Over Plan to Boost Profit,"Wonder if this impacts F's thinking on its dividend in the mid/long term...

* * *

(Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor Co.’s plan to spend years and $11 billion restructuring itself was dealt a major setback by Moody’s Investors Service, which cut the carmaker’s credit rating over doubt that the company’s initiatives will generate earnings and cash.

Moody’s downgraded Ford to Ba1, saying its cash flow and profit margins are below expectations and are likely to remain weak over the next two years.

Investors have been contemplating whether Ford would be able to maintain its investment-grade status for the past year as the company potentially faces higher steel tariffs and slowing sales have weighed on profits. It’s rated BBB -- two steps above junk -- at S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, and both have negative outlooks.

* * *

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The downgrade of Ford Motor Co.’s debt to junk by Moody’s Investors Service on Monday will most likely spark a fresh wave of soul-searching among investors about the risk of highly leveraged companies that are clinging to investment-grade ratings.

Moody’s cut Ford’s credit rating one level to Ba1 from Baa3. If it’s downgraded to junk by either S&amp;P Global Ratings or Fitch Ratings, it will officially become a “fallen angel,” with its debt sent away to high-yield indexes.

The good news for those who hold Ford’s roughly $84 billion of outstanding public bonds and loans is that the other two big credit rating companies rate the automaker BBB, two steps above speculative grade. Both have a negative outlook (as Moody’s did before its downgrade), but Ford is at least a bit further from the brink with S&amp;P and Fitch than it was with Moody’s, though it’s hardly unprecedented for a company to have its rating lowered by two or more notches at a time.

Moody’s said the downgrade reflected “the weak earnings and cash generation likely as the company pursues a lengthy and costly restructuring plan. … Ford is undertaking this restructuring from a weak position as measures of cash flow and profit margins are below our expectations, and below the performance of investment-grade rated auto peers.”

But the passage that will catch the broader credit market’s attention is the following:


“The erosion in Ford's performance has occurred during a period in which global automotive conditions have been fairly healthy. Ford now faces the challenge of addressing these operational problems as demand in major markets is softening, and as the auto industry is contending with an unprecedented pace of change.”

It’s not hard to extrapolate this kind of reasoning to a number of companies that are legacy household names, saddled with large piles of debt as they struggle to adapt to change in a slow-but-steady economy. General Electric Co., the conglomerate with more than $100 billion in debt, comes to mind. Remember, it was GE that prompted Guggenheim Partners’s Scott Minerd to tweet late last year that “the slide and collapse in investment grade credit has begun.” 

That obviously didn’t happen, with U.S. high-grade corporate debt returning more than 13% this year. Those invested in triple-B bonds did a bit of a victory lap, saying the hysteria over mass downgrades was overblown, particularly because the Federal Reserve stopped raising interest rates and starting dropping them again.


To be fair, speculation about a potential Ford downgrade existed even before Minerd made his dire prediction. Bloomberg News’s Molly Smith quoted a portfolio manager 10 months ago who said that Ford was fighting a “multiple-front war” and that “there’s a better chance than not it ends up in high yield.” Well, now it is, at least as far as Moody’s is concerned. For Ford’s management, it will have to wait and see whether this cut causes the other rating companies to follow suit. For bond investors, the pressing issue is that that Ford has many of the same characteristics that had them spooked not too long ago. They’ll have to decide whether the risk they cast aside for much of this year deserves another round of scrutiny.

That's all I can think of rn but I'm sure there's more. The reason for all the credit cards is because my mom thought credit cards were the answer to every problem I had. If I needed money she'd apply for a card on my behalf. I'm trying to dig myself out but it's an arduous process.

Edit: I make about $1900 every two weeks after taxes. Currently, my 401(k) contribution is $25 out of my own paycheck, and employer matches, so it comes to $50/paycheck going into that.

People keep asking about the car thing. So additional info: Technically the car is in my moms name, and it's not new. It's new to me, a much smaller, considerably more fuel efficient 2015 Hyundai. And the reason is I needed a more reliable car than my '06 Kia that has rust through the frame, 160K miles on it, a check engine light no mechanic can diagnose, 18mpg (requiring $40-$60/WEEK in gas) and a penchant for dying on the side of highways. But the Kia was my first car, and it's 100% MINE on paper and everything that for me, emotionally, I'm not ready or willing to part with it. I cry thinking about it, and I've spent a LOT of time in tears trying to convince myself to do exactly that. It's been around the country with me, when I first moved off campus, when I graduated, my first date in college, my first dance, my first community theatre rehearsal-that car took me to all of that and it's been more like family to me than anyone in my life. Emotionally, selling it just isn't an option, it's too upsetting to me right now.  And even if I did sell it, With all of its problems I couldn't get any $ for it. And in the winter I may still need it, since it has 4WD and it's an SUV which means it's capable of moving large things or a lot of things easily.",finance

personalfinance,"I’m trying to move out on my own in an expensive state, with the state of my finances do you think it’s doable?","So I just got two new jobs. Job A pays $17/hour. I have yet to start it. Training starts on the 16th. It’s 4 weeks long, 8am - 5pm Monday through Friday. So that’ll be 45 (prolly 40 cause lunch) hours a week in the first month. I have the option of working 32 or 40 hours a week after that. I’ll choose 32 hours so I have enough time for my second job. 

Job B is very flexible and will work around the schedule of Job A. It’s a commission based job. You get $65 or $100 depending on what you sell. If you don’t make a sale, you’ll get $12/hour. I’m operating on the assumption that I won’t make a sale in the first month so I can make a solid budget. I can do anywhere from 16-30 hours at that job. I plan on doing 16 the first month cause I’ll only have time to do it on the weekends. After that I’d probably go up to like 18 or 20. 

So I’ll be working ~56 hours per week for the next month. I’ll be making ~$3,488/month (at least the first month). That’s the untaxed amount, idk how broke I’ll be after taxes. The following months I believe I’ll be making ~$3,040/month. Maybe more cause I’ll hopefully get sales at job B. 

Im just gonna go over my whole financial situation so you guys get a clear picture of what I’m working with. 

- Both of my jobs are in Boston. I don’t have a car. I pay $90/month for transportation. I occasionally take Uber if I’m pressed for time, but that’s an expense I can cut out by managing my time properly. 

- I spent about $100/month on groceries, but that’s because my mom cooks. I typically buy ready meals and shit like that. On my own I’d probably spend $200 or $250 on food. I can maybe cut that down if I start cooking and freezing meals and stuff. 

- I spend ~$100 on fast food and stuff and I can definitely cut that down. I don’t need it. 

- My phone bill is $121/month. I pay for my mom’s phone too and she gives me $65 for it. So I pay $56 in reality. She’s usually late with her payments tho. 

- I pay $25/month for both Netflix and Hulu. It’s for the whole family so I could probably pass one off to one of my peeps if need be. 

- $50 automatically gets out into my savings every week at my current job. I’ll do the same at both my new jobs, meaning I’ll be saving $100/week now. I have a little over $1,600 in my savings account. It should be a lot more, but I had some trouble keeping my hands out of the cookie jar earlier this year. 

- I have about $40 in cash. I rarely use cash, I actually forget it’s there most of the time, the when I remember I just put some of it in my savings. 

Those are all the bills I have right now. It’s nearly $600, I feel like I’m forgetting something though cause I live paycheck to paycheck right now. Maybe it’s because I use Uber too much (up to 4 times a day) to get to my minimum wage part time job. Plus I work at a mall and it’s hard to say no to the clothes and food! If that’s why I’m always going broke living with family I’m hopeful that I’ll be able to move out on my own.  

My credit is nearly 700. I have a credit card and my limit is $1,200. The most I’ve used at one time is $320 and that was for a vacation. I just paid it off and I’m kinda broke. Less than $100 in my checkings and my next paycheck is gonna be sorry. Not even $200. I’ll have enough money to get to and from my new jobs and be fed until that new job money starts coming in. I forgot to ask whether they’re weekly or biweekly, but it seems like most jobs in Mass are weekly. That’s what I’m hoping for. 

I live in Massachusetts and I’m looking for one bedroom apartments around Boston. I really don’t want roommates. I wanna be an independent woman! If I’m making like $3,000/month and my bills equal up to about $600/month, what should my rent limit be? Would $2,000 be reasonable or am I pushing it? Is my math off somewhere? Are there bills I’m forgetting? How much should I have saved before I go? 

I should also probably be factoring in furniture cause I have none. I’d get a bed ASAP and put it on my credit card so I can pay it off over a 4 week period. That’s how I’d acquire all my furniture. Is that financially smart?

Ideally I’d be out by next month, but if I’m on my own by January of 2020, that’d be great. Is it doable? Any advice is appreciated.",finance

investing,SoftBank urges WeWork to shelve IPO,"https://www.ft.com/content/111f8e00-d346-11e9-8367-807ebd53ab77

SoftBank, the biggest outside shareholder in WeWork, is urging the lossmaking property group to shelve its hotly anticipated initial public offering after it received a cool reception from investors, according to people briefed on the discussions.

WeWork’s parent company, the We Company, has been aiming to raise between $3bn and $4bn in its flotation. But it has faced criticism from investors and analysts on Wall Street over its governance, payments made to co-founder and chief executive Adam Neumann and its use of a complicated corporate structure.

SoftBank and its Saudi-backed Vision Fund have pumped more than $10bn into the office space provider. But SoftBank’s enthusiasm for a listing has waned as bankers have slashed the valuation they believe the We Company can attain when it lists.

Advisors for the We Company were said to still be testing investor appetite at a valuation of between $15bn and $20bn, according to people briefed on the matter. That is far below the $47bn valuation given to WeWork when SoftBank invested $2bn in the business this year.

SoftBank itself is trying to raise $108bn for a second Vision Fund to invest in technology start-ups. The Japanese group could face challenges raising that sum if the We Company were to list at a steep discount to its last funding round, the people said.

WeWork is set to receive $1.5bn from SoftBank next year as part of an agreement struck at the start of this year. The company listed $2.5bn of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet as of June 30, according to filings with US securities regulators.

The We Company, citing mandatory restrictions on communications ahead of an IPO, and SoftBank declined to comment.

If the We Company were to shelve the listing, it would also lose access to a $6bn loan from a group of banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, that was contingent on the IPO raising at least $3bn in new investment.

The lack of more than $9bn in new capital could force a dramatic change in the We Company’s corporate strategy, including its aggressive expansion that has seen it open 528 locations in more than 110 cities.

The company has lost more than $4bn since 2016, burning through capital even as its revenues have doubled each year over that period. WeWork said in its IPO filing that it could slow its expansion dramatically if it needed to become profitable.

But investors have remained sceptical of the business model, which has not yet been tested by a significant economic downturn. Some investors have raised concerns about its practice of leasing office space for a long period — on average for 15 years — while renting to tenants on a shorter basis.

WeWork has sought to address some of the issues investors and analysts have raised ahead of its IPO. Mr Neumann has returned a $5.9m payment his investment vehicle received from the company for the rights to use the trademarked word “we”. The We Company also disclosed last week that it would add a woman to its all-male board of directors once it completed its listing.",finance

personalfinance,"Need advice: where to learn/get started on investing, what is recommended for my age, should I hire someone?","Throwaway cause there are people who know my main account and I don’t want them to know about my finances. 

This all started bc of a conversation I had with a family friend regarding investing, planning for the future, etc. this has prompted me to take a look at my savings account and try to determine what my next move should be and what to do with my money. I have read some stuff here and have determined the next steps I’d like to take (more details below) but need help deciding what to do with the remainder of the money in my savings. 

I am 27F, single with no kids. I rent an apartment (probably will buy a house in the next 5 years when I decide where to settle).

- Salary: ~93k gross (includes a 9K bonus) 

- Debt: ~20k car loan (thru Bank of America, 3.24% interest rate 48 month term, have 41 months left). No other student loan debt or CC debt. 

- 401k thru job- Putting in 7% as employee matches 100% of the first 3% and 50% of the next 4%. This thru Voya, it is all allocated in T. Rowe Price 2055 Fund (balance is ~70k) 

- About 43k in a regular savings account (I literally just learned about HYSAs so I’ll be moving this money) 

My plan moving forward: 

- Getting myself a Roth IRA, I’ll be putting in the allowed 6K for this year and then automatically putting in $500 per month next year to max that out. I literally have no idea how this works, I assume I am allowed to set it up this way? I’d also like know what to do with this money, I read the easiest way is to select a target retirement fund but would like suggestions on how to manage this (actually where can I learn to manage this money?) I can set up a Roth IRA thru Voya, is this the best place to do this? Or are there any other recommended places? What do you look for when determining where to set up a Roth IRA?

- For my 401k: I think I’ll leave it in the target retirement fund it is in right now, will consider managing different investments when I learn how to. Same question as above- where can I learn about this? Is there a rule of thumb as to how to allocate this money?

- For my savings: I keep this money in a regular savings account. I also keep a minimum 2k in my checking account. Currently at 43K- I’ll be moving 6K to open my Roth IRA, I think I’ll keep 2k in the regular savings account for now (easy access 1 month emergency fund), would like to move 10k to a HYSA (5 month emergency fund for a total of 6 months of emergency money). This leaves me with about 25k in savings. Should I pay off my loan? Should I keep this money in the HYSA mentioned above for a future house? Should I invest this money (once I learn how to)? Is it a good idea to keep 2k in my checking acct and 2k in a savings or should I move it all to the HYSA? 

I currently follow a budget which allows me to continue to save 1k a month and still have plenty of money to travel or treat myself to a nice dinner, shopping etc. since I plan to buy a house in the near future would it make more sense to keep saving the 1k for a house or increase the % for my 401k?

personalfinance,I Bought a Prius Prime and I Hate It (x-post /r/askcarsales),"This is a crosspost from /r/askcarsales. /u/Lucosis recommended posting here for a different perspective. You can read the original post here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/d2845b/i_bought_a_prius_prime_and_i_hate_it/

First of all, I’d like to say I feel really stupid and embarrassed for buying this car in this trim level. I hardly ever post to Reddit, but I’ve made some bad financial decisions and would really appreciate anybody’s advice.

On July 12 a couple months ago somebody ran a red light and totaled my 2004 Honda Civic. I was totally fine, but when I called my mom to come pick me up she had a heart attack and then a stroke from complications with the heart attack. Thankfully, her recovery has gone really well, but this has caused a lot of stress in my life, and I haven’t been sleeping well.

State Farm is sending me a settlement check for $4,556.56 to arrive sometime this week, and I’m also expecting my $500.00 deductible later when my insurance receives that from the other driver’s insurance who has claimed full responsibility for the accident. 

I wanted to test drive a 2020 Prius to see if that should be the car I should purchase to replace my totaled Civic, so I went into the Toyota dealership on Saturday. When I arrived, the salesman said he misheard me on the phone and thought I wanted a Prius Prime. I said I would rather have a Prime, but it was out of my budget of $20k-$24k and a max of $350/month for a car. He convinced me that with CA and Fed tax incentives totaling $6,000, and the $1,500 labor day incentive, it would be worth it to buy the last 2019 Prius Prime Advanced model they had.

With a down payment of $8,000 and my credit score of 666 (I know), my monthly payments would be $633 to finance the car. I said that was way too high but he asked me to take out my budget to show him why I couldn’t afford it. My monthly salary is $7,000, and I have high monthly expenses living in Downtown Los Angeles and owning a dog. 

Where he found wiggle room in my budget was the $1,333 I save for taxes every month. I’m expecting to pay $12,000 in state and federal taxes in April since I started my new job on July 8, and the dealer said with the rebates I would only have to pay $6,000.  If my taxes were cut in half with the electric vehicle tax rebate, he said I would only need to save $666.50/month (yep there’s that number again). 

I really liked driving the car, and he convinced me that with 133mpg the Prius Prime would be the best car for me in the long run, so I signed the finance contract for $35,000 and put down $3,000 nearly draining my savings with the promise of putting down another $5,000 when I received my insurance claim. I had only slept a total of 10 hours in the past 48 hours, so that probably also affected my decision making process.

I drove the car from where I bought it in Huntington Beach to San Diego to move stuff out of my mom’s house where I have been living for the past two years. When I got there, I went over a letter I received from UC Riverside about $6,519.06 that I owe for my last semester there. It says that amount was sent to the FTB (Franchise Tax Board), and they would collect any tax refunds. I contacted my uncle who’s a lawyer with a tax emphasis degree, and he said I wouldn’t receive the $1,500 state tax rebate for buying an electric vehicle because of this delinquent debt.

I was really scared about how that would affect my budget, so I went over it again the night I purchased the car. I realized the $4,500 federal tax rebate from the car purchase doesn’t work like a deductible and doesn’t mean I can stop saving $1,333/month for taxes. I still have to pay $12,000 in April and wait for my $4,500 tax rebate.

That means with my car payment, all my bills, and what I have to save for taxes, I only have $616.00/month left. I haven’t eaten for two days since working this out because I feel like I can’t afford to eat anymore after buying this car.

On top of that, there are no charging stations at my apartment until December, so I have to rely on the Greenlots charging station at work. I was on the phone with the Greenlots support team for a total of an hour trying to get my car to charge to no avail yesterday during work. During the troubleshooting, I tried to charge my car a total of 8 times which means I was charged eight $60.00 authorization fees totaling $480.00 in pending charges on my account.

I saw a BMW i3 and two Chevy Volts charge at that station with no problem. I asked the second guy with a Chevy Volt for help, and he walked me through how he gets the charging station to work on his car, but it didn’t work for my Prius Prime. I am able to charge my car with the cord Toyota provides, but I don’t have anywhere to plug it in at the apartment I just moved into nor at work.

I’m also disappointed with the gas mileage on the Prius Prime. I almost exclusively drive on the freeway for my 40 mile round trip commute to work and so far on EV and ECO mode I’m only getting 40mpg compared to the 133mpg advertised.

What’s the best way to approach the dealership to try to renegotiate the contract for the Prius Prime and let me lease or finance a Corolla LE instead? I’ve driven 375 miles on the Prius Prime in the last 65 hours during my move.

TL;DR: I bought a 2019 Prius Prime Advanced for the tax rebate and gas mileage, but I won’t get the full tax rebate, the rebate doesn’t work out with my budget like the dealer explained to me, my car doesn’t charge with the only charging station conveniently available to me, and I’m not getting the advertised gas mileage. How can I get a Corolla instead?

UPDATE: They let me trade in the Prius for a Corolla! My dealer and his manager were completely empathetic and understanding from the second I talked to them. I know I made a stupid decision, and I don’t deserve this. This outcome is extremely rare and the dealership loses a lot of money by taking the Prius back but nobody at Toyota of Huntington Beach even gave me shit for it. Nobody even mentioned the loss on the deal until everything was set up and I was doing signatures in financing.",finance

personalfinance,How is the 401k/retirement for the federal government??,"Hi pf,

I currently have a 401k with a decently substantial balance (for my young age) with my employer of the last 5 years.

personalfinance,How to refinance student loans for wife when I'm not a co-signer on the original loans?,"Hello all,

So I've been attempting to get my wife's student loans refinanced away from her combination of fed loans (6% avg, ~70k) and wells fargo loan (10%, ~7k).  Her current income is lower (~38k) due to the fact that she is currently studying for a board exam (which when passed should double her income) as well as being on Maternity leave for a while longer.  My income is around 110k, and we have no other debt other than a mortgage payment.

So the issue we are having is that all these automated website applications for student loan refinance don't allow for a co-signer to be added BEFORE our loan application is rejected due to my wife's lower income and lower credit score (~700).  All the places so far make it clear that we are to input her income alone, not household.  I was told by one customer service person that I could apply for the loan refinance myself, but later on down the process I was then told this could only be the case if I was a co-signer on the original loans, which I am not.  What options do we have?  Do any banks take into account household income?  I have also been thinking of doing maybe a heloc (I have around 55% equity) or some other fixed rate personal loan maybe?  As long and the rates are lower than 6%.  Does anyone have experience with a situation similar to ours?

I've spent the last two weeks completely nailing down every single dollar of my budget, and I am confident that I can pay it down completely by February.

This is good, since the interest rate on it is an absurd 19.89%.

The minimum payment is nearly $560. It's not actually the highest interest debt I have. I have a credit card with ~24% interest that has a balance around $200, but the minimum payment on that is only $25.

I will pay slightly more in interest by doing it this way (which isn't snowball or avalanche). My focus, instead is to remove the highest minimum payment first, to increase cash flow, which increases the rate of paying down other debts and savings, because at the moment my goals are restricted more by cashflow surplus than anything else.

So, all of that is background for my real question.

I only have 5 open accounts on my credit, and one of them is my car loan. My average account age is also less than 4 years, with the loan actually being my oldest account. My on time payment % is just barely below 98% (an unexpected life change that I didn't have an emergency fund for, and generally living beyond my means), which has led me to where I am now: budgeting, planning, saving, etc.

If I pay the loan off completely, will I miss out on all those on time payments marked on my credit? The loan will come off my accounts, right? So then, my average account age, my credit mix, my total open accounts, and my on time payment % would ALL drop. This has made me think that my score will probably drop nearly 60-80 points if I pay off this loan completely.

If I pay the entire loan except say the last $100, I won't have to make payments again until the last payment, freeing up the cash flow. All subsequent payments will be marked as ""on time"" since based on the amortization schedule of the loan, I made that payment already, just ahead of time.

This would cost me ~$20 per year in interest to maintain, but it's only for another 18 months or so left on the loan.

Is this worth it? Are my concerns about how paying off this loan might affect my credit warranted?",finance
personalfinance,Need help on deciding what to do with money from selling home.,"My wife and I are selling our first home and will have around $60,000 after paying realtor fees and what not. One option that I would like to do would be to pay off our auto loans. One is at a 7% interest rate and the other at a 4%. Total they are around $45,000. This would free up close to $900 a month in payments that could go towards our new mortgage and savings account. 

My wife would like to keep the money and get back into school. 

I fully support her going back to school, but I think the extra stability of having fewer bills every month and having the extra cash every month would be better for our family. 

Need a little bit of advice. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Sallie Mae has raised my interest rate to a ludicrous rate and are not informing me why and are straight up ignoring my questions. I need advice on how to battle this or some good loan consolidation options.,"I’ll keep this short and sweet (or bitter rather).

As the title states, Sallie Mae recently raised my interest rate to 10.75%, my loan amount is 28k. I have called them multiple times and have tried to get it lowered to no avail.

What are my options? Currently I’m paying $250 in interest alone every month and my total monthly payment is around $360. I’ve been paying around $500 each month to try and chip away at it faster but I realize that it would be a lot faster if I also reconsolidated this loan and also paid 500 every month.

What are some good loan reconsolidating options? I’ve tried my bank but they don’t offer student loan reconsolidating options anymore. I’ve gone to my parents since they have excellent credit and asked them if they could reconsolidate it for me by taking a personal loan (they could probably get a rate of 3-4% with their credit) and I would just pay them every month instead of Sallie Mae but they shut that idea down and are not willing to help.

What can I do? Any help/criticism would be greatly appreciated and I can provide some additional info if needed.

Edit: To further clarify, I know I signed up for variable rate but was told as long as I make the monthly payments on time they wouldn’t raise the rate on me (if that’s wrong I understand, that’s just what I had been told)

For the past 1.5 years I have been making the minimum plus an extra 150-200 dollars, but my interest rate has increased by 3.5 points.

Edit 2 from what I’ve learned  before I go to sleep:

1. Always choose fixed rate over variable
2. Shop around for rates instead of sticking to one financial institution
3. Interest rates can fluctuate for various external reasons (hence always choosing fixed rate)
4. The people of Reddit are very helpful!

personalfinance,Should I borrow from my 401k to pay off my Student Loans?,"I currently have approximately $62k in student loans, and the balance is split between a private lender (about $22k) and my mother (about $40k). My mother bought my student loans about 5 years ago out of the goodness of her heart to help reduce my total spend over the life of my loan when it was revealed that her HELOC had a 2.75% interest rate (vs the 6.5% of my SL). She paid off about $70k in this manner. While my mom means very well, she is incredibly inept when it comes to PF. She has a long history of poor financial decisions, and neglecting to mention that the loan was variable interest rate was certainly one of them. I have been paying $660 a month since July 2014, and some quick excel work shows that if I assume the interest rate is 4.27% I still owe the $40k figure.

I have no idea what the current interest rate is, how much I still owe my mother, or when interest rates changed against the HELOC. She also commingled many other items on the same line of credit. I might be able to convince her to let me see the online statements, but I am worried that I may never be able to work backwards to figure out the exact number (though I am very good at this type of thing).

So... I have more than enough in my 401k to borrow against myself and pay off my mother. At least a rough estimate of what I owe her at the moment anyway, erring in her favor. By my math I owe my mother about 5 more years of payments, and I would have to repay a 401k loan in 5 years, so I would not necessarily be freeing up any cash flow, but rather transferring the debt yet again. The way I see it I would be paying myself interest on the loan instead of my mother's lender if I take this approach. What am I missing here?",finance
personalfinance,Auto Loan Repayment - How much am I “losing” in this scenario?,"I just opened an account for an auto loan.

* Principal: $21,500
* Interest Rate: 3.74%
* Term: 65 months
* Monthly Payment: $365.93

I set up bi-weekly payments for half of the monthly amount, so that I’ve got 26 payments happening per year, and am “overpaying” twice per year to shorten the loan term and interest paid. I’ve set up bi-weekly payments for $182.97.

When I reached out to my bank, they said that when these “extra” payments happen twice per year, there is no way to get them to automatically apply directly to the principal. I would need to call/email in and ask that the payment is applied directly to principal every single time. I am having a hard time calculating out how much I would be “losing” (i.e. not saving) in this scenario by not reaching out, and instead simply having these extra payments go to both interest and principal. (Interest is accrued daily, not monthly, in case that matters).

Now for the purposes of this post lets make these assumptions and assume that they are accurate:

* the loan term is 5 years

*  the monthly and/or interest rate will be slightly less than the growth of the S&amp;P 500 (I fully understand that the market isn't rational and that a recession could happen at any time, but *strictly* for the purposes of this question, lets assume at that any given month the return of the S&amp;P will always be higher than the interest rate)

* I have $30,000 in cash in my bank and I have no need for this loan 

* Aside for the $30,000 in cash in my bank, I also have an emergency fund

* I have no mortgage or rent payments

* All expenses together can be kept under 2k a month 

* I make more than $75,000 a year but less than $125,000 (range is based on salary + bonus)

* And that regardless of how bad the economy gets, I will have job security at this salary range for the time of the loan (Again I understand this is never a guarantee, anything can happen, but lets just assume this statement holds true for this question) 



Are there any downsides to this loan in **this theoretical** situation?  

  
&amp;nbsp;

Edit: I should've clarified - this  **isn't** something that I am doing. This was a was *food for thought* question asked by our professor, who asked us to this about it, and then said we could discuss it next class. This isn't a homework question or a graded question. 

Because of this, we can assume a few more things:

* If the S&amp;P returns 5% every month for the terms of this loan - the interest rate will be ~4%
* If the S&amp;P returns 13% every month for the terms of this loan - the interest rate will be ~4%
* If the S&amp;P returns a variable % every month for the terms of this loan - the interest rate will be variable but less than the S&amp;P
* The S&amp;P will always return greater than 1% and in that case, the interest rate for that/those months will be 0% on the loan



Our prof said we would discuss the negatives (if there are any) behind this sort of situation and I can't think of any.",finance

personalfinance,"I’m stressing out about getting a Parent Plus loan instead of a federal unsubsidized loan, should I be?","I’m honestly panicking and I don’t know if I should be. I find out tomorrow if my appeal for federal unsubsidized loans was approved, but I can’t sleep. If it’s not approved I have to get an additional parent plus loan instead. I would be getting $4000 for the year of unsub loans in this case, and then paying like $6000 out of pocket (I can handle this). If I don’t get approved then my dad applied for the max amount of parent plus loans and that ended up being $9927 for the year. This is way more than I want to take out and I’m sorta panicking because of that huge number. I desperately need advice on this. The bill is due Thursday or I’ll be kicked out of classes. My parents didn’t go to college and don’t know what to do. Is a parent plus loan considerably worse than a unsubsidized federal loan? 

I’m considering rejecting $6000 of the loans and just sucking it up and paying the $4000 a semester, since I would basically be doing that if I got the unsub loans (that amount was never offered to me before). Would this be my best choice?

personalfinance,Need advice on paying debt down and correcting my credit.,"So I'm a 25 yr old male who's in a bit of a pickle.  I'm in a good job making decent money about 1500-1800/month.  I live in a stable environment with about 600/month in utilities and rent.  My issue comes into play from when I was younger and building credit I had 3-4 cards that I used to build credit.  My parents lost their job and in order to not get evicted and leave the power on for me and my brothers to finish high school, I had to use my credit to pay bills for about 6 months with little to no way to feasibly pay off the debt in the long run.  I ended up with about 8k in petty credit card debt across 4/5 cards and 4k in a personal loan.  I have a car note of 2300 and a student loan of about 1500.  Overall I have about 8k in high 23-35% interest credit card debt and about 8k in loan debt 4-15% interest.

My biggest issue is coming into play with my car at the moment.  It is starting to have motor troubles and I will be needing a new car within the next 6 months.  I have gotten a second job making ~800-1000/month extra.  I also have a 401k from my first job that has stagnated at about 2,500 as I have not been able to roll it over to my new position.  I know there is huge penalties for it but I am looking at a short term solution to a problem that I haven't been able to make a dent in for several years due to high interest rates.

I wanted to try cashing out the 401k and I'm anticipating about a 40% loss on it putting it at about 1600 payout.  I'm also going to try and funnel one paycheck from my main job and 100% of my paycheck from my second job into the debt which would put me at about 1500/month.  My question comes in the form of which would have to best benefit to a short term credit boost.  My credit is not great and the primary factor is credit utilized is near 90%.  I don't know if I should try and pay the loan debt down as far as I can as quick as I can since a vehicle is going to be high on the priority list in the next 6 months or if I should pay down the petty credit first to get the utilization down.  I have an appointment on Friday with my bank to talk about the options I have with them and if they offer any kind of potential consolidation for the petty debt but I am not hopeful on that front with my lower than average credit.  I know /r/personal finance tends to lean more towards long term goals but at the moment my short term needs help.  Thanks In advance.",finance

personalfinance,Debit Card Used Without Authorization,"Last week on Wednesday I tried to use my debit card to make a purchase online and kept getting declined, despite knowing I had well over the $ amount of the transaction in my account.  So I called that evening into my credit union - one of the largest and most respected credit unions in the USA - and the rep told me that my debit card had been locked due to a suspicious transaction that had come through for almost $400, but that they had caught it before it had even hit my pending.  He told me the name of the merchant, it sounded like an online payday loan place or something, and I didn't recognize the transaction.   So he said he was reporting it for fraud, cancelled the debit card and they sent a new one out to me via FedEx.  I went ahead and made two payments to two of my credit cards via ACH so I would have access to the money in my account while I waited for the new debit card.  On Friday I get up and look at my account, wanted to make sure that the credit card payments cleared, and was horrified to see that 1) both payments were returned NSF, and 2)  the payment for nearly $400 posted to my account.  I promptly contacted the CU again, they apologized and proceeded to give me the run-around with no one in either the member services or card services seemingly knowing what was going on or whether it was an ACH or debit card transaction.  Finally it was sorted out, and I was told that they would ""expedite"" the provisional credit to my account.  Well it is Tuesday, still nothing.  

Here's the thing though.  After talking with them again today and being told that legally they had up to ten days to provide the provisional credit, I started researching the loan place.  As it turns out, this loan company operates under two different names, and I immediately recognized the other name.  I had in the past taken out a couple loans with them at  their location in town and paid them off, and at the time had indeed provided them with my debit card number for repayment.  Last month I had taken out a loan again, but this time online, using a different bank, bank account number, and debit card number.  I did not pay it off by the due date however as I had an unexpected event happen and was waiting until I would be paid again later this month to pay it off.  

Since they had my info from previous loans, I guess they figured it was their right to ram through the current loan's payment on old info despite not authorizing them to do so.  Will I still get this money back?  Are they allowed to do this?  Should I call my credit union and update them on what I have figured out or should I keep my mouth shut and just wait and see?",finance

It's not Mr Roger's or that they don't work hard enough, it's that the system doesn't reward that work.

A never ending race with no light at the other side of the tunnel. Psychology shows us this leads to lack of self esteem and eventually motivation. We see it in animal training psychology and humans all the time. Main point, the rewardless system they grew up that was built around them from the previous generations is the cause of the self esteem problem with the generations of today, and it extends far beyond just those who watched mr Roger's. Unless you can prove Mr Roger's somehow built the financial state around everyone, then he is not at fault for what's happening to the society today.

They'll never let it go though, why would they when it made them rich? They'll lie tooth and nail to blame everyone but themselves and it's working. Cause today everyone the media says is at fault is everyone but the bankers and federal reserves who built this system like we were saying in 2005. That's why they crashed the financial markets to distract everyone, then turned it into this bullshit of the distraction blame game we've been seeing after 2008 when they loosened financial regulations and started releasing simulations for the markets to grow. What's needed is for people to abandon their financial game with an alternative like a certain cryptographic invention that removes the needs of banks and their games, and can absorb the value of their wealth taking the power of it's control away from them, so in the next recession everyone can move their wealth power away from their hands.

financialindependence,"Been living off CD dividends, looking for ideas of where to spend the money?","I just discovered this subreddit, but I've been doing something like FIRE already. From looking at a bunch of posts here, I have a fairly different approach. I'm living in the Northeast US in a moderately-priced city, and am single/childfree at 33M. I had a rare job from 21-31 where I made 200K/year working hard at a solid 50-55hr/week.

I put all my money into ladders of 7-year CDs (at an average of 3% annual dividends) and a 403b, and just live off the dividends now. I've got about 30 years to go until I can use my 403b money, but I've calculated out how to spend my dividend money and then exactly all of my CD principal even if interest rates are 0%, just right until my 403b kicks in. I've got it so that I'll get an allowance of $30-32K/year throughout my life, and I own a house outright worth about $400K so that's a piece of equity I can tap into as backup.

I'm finding that I naturally spend $20K/year living pretty comfortably. I'm looking to spend more (about 10K/year discretionary money) to improve my life somehow. Three things I've recently done is buy higher quality furniture and clothing, focusing on decluttering by disposing things I never use, and switching to usb-c products to reduce down to one type of cable. I also took an interest in gadgets (fancy flashlights, musical instruments, and mirrorless cameras).

What else can I spend money on in the future that slowly improves my life in a similar way? I don't really like to travel as I did that for work for about 10 years and I'm just sick of it all. And I'm not looking for ways to invest and make more money, as I feel like I have enough and don't want the hassle/risk. I gave my extra money to my parents last year and they said thanks but just put it in their index funds.",finance

personalfinance,"No credit, need a new (used) vehicle","I'm looking for some advice on a making good financial decision. I need some sort of new vehicle be it used, new, or leased. This is a requirement as my current car is on it's last legs. I'm trying to decide the best financial option given my situation below.

* I'm 25 years old, relatively stable job/career in California. 
* I make about 75k before taxes (I contribute to a 401k as well). 
* No debt
* I have no credit score to speak of and have not built any credit(big mistake I know)
* My expenses leave me with approximately $1100 (+/- $100) in savings per month.
* I have a approximately 26k in savings

I'm working on adjusting my incomes/expenses, and increasing my investment/retirement options. Given that, 

* Should I get an auto loan? How much should it be? Very likely I will have a high interest rate. I was considering a loan of ~9k.
* How much of a car can I really afford? I was originally interested in reasonably newer used cars (2016-2019) in the $14k-$21k range. But now I'm considering if it would be worth it without a loan or with a high interest loan.
* Is leasing for three years (then buying a new car/purchasing the leased car) typically worth it?

Searching the subreddit and google has led me to the conclusion that I would better spend my money on a ~6-8k used car instead and buy a nicer car when I have credit. To be honest, I would like to avoid this ""intermediary"" step if I can, a nice reasonably new car I can drive for 10-15 years sounds great. Does anyone have any thoughts?",finance

\-Contributing 8% to 401k with 4% company match, which is about $400/month

\-Rate of return on the 401k has been about 16% since I joined the company a year ago

personalfinance,Financing house to pay off car loan?,"Hi there, I'm hoping to get some advice.

So we are trying to plan for two years out. We currently have a 30yr mortgage (3 years in) financed at 2.79% fixed for 5 years (will get a new rate in 2020). On top of this we have a car payment for another 6 years at 2.99% and still owe $30K as of today. 

So my question is, as of today, would it be better to up our mortgage payments, or up our car payments, or does it not matter because the interest rates are so similar? (We have an extra $150/bi-weekly that were planning on putting on one of these, so it isn't enough to pay off the car in 2 years). Also, we have no idea what mortgage interest rates would be in 2 years, so that's an obvious risk.

TLDR: does it matter in our case where we put our extra money if we end up rolling what's remaining on the car into the house in 2 years?",finance

Bitcoin,BTC positive feedback loop,"Think of the many hobby miners or people who got BTC over the counter, or via exchanges prior to the strict KYC-type regs.

A lot of these people may easily have 0.25+ BTC and are hodling. Let's say price jumps at next halvening or two, eventually, doesn't matter when, just theoretically that it does at some point move in a big positive direction such that people with this *small* amount of BTC they've hodled actually have a substantial return. Let's say price of $200k for ease of numbering.

Now $50k worth of BTC. What happens when they try to spend this? You try to withdrawal $10k+ from a bank account and the bank is obliged to investigate and maybe even report. How about paying down your mortgage with $25k worth of BTC? When price reaches these numbers my guess is mortgage companies are accepting BTC payments but these are probably predicated on strict regulations and reporting requirements. Just thinking of how we get legislation in these areas makes me think we're 20 years out from real adoption, but that's another post.

The point is, people will be incentivized NOT to spend large amounts of BTC, especially if they don't have a clear paper trail (including tax payments) on their hodlings. This is a restriction on sell pressure,, which increases the price at which the market balances! which encourages hodling.

Further, as we all know, fiat is not only doomed but subject to inflation. This means that even assuming that btc **value** remains stable with respect to goods and services, it's *price* in terms of fiat will continue to increase. If that price increases at a rate greater than the interest rate of your debt, that makes it in your best interest **not** to pay off the debt, but to make minimum payments for as long as possible, hodling BTC instead.

It will take a lot of years for lenders to transition and realize they cannot lend fiat at high enough interest rates to make sense. Fiat systems will implode and BTC will be the standard. It will happen, it is just a matter of time. The countries that embrace it are going to be superpowers financially. The world is going to be really different soon.",cryptocurrency

50K Annual Income - my current take home pay after taxes + 401K is $2925, paid monthly. Monthly bills (rent / utilities / medical insurance / transportation) total $1495; whatever is left over is put towards food and paying off CC Debt.

CC A - $9,900 (APR 24.74%)

CC B - $13,479.30 (APR 24.74%)

Minimum payment on Card A is currently $725. Minimum payment on Card B is currently $600. I make both minimum payments as soon as I receive my paycheck. I have also been selling my clothes or unused bags on the side to try and bring in a little extra income to put towards both cards, but a good month of selling brings in maybe \~$100.

Both cards are Amex Skymiles cards, and as far as I can tell with these cards, transferring my balance onto another card with a lower interest rate is not an option. Between this much debt and a current credit score of 695, I hesitate to even try applying for another card.

Edit cont'd: It also appears the credit union I spoke with that offers a 5% interest rate is call it a CTL but it might be more like a personal loan using the car as collateral? my definition of a Clear Title Loan might be off because I'm looking at options that would be under 8% interest   


So here's the quick story. and for context this is my friend I am speaking for, but I will post this as if I am him.

I was hit by a car that totaled my vehicle sedan. I used insurance money and my credit card to pay for a new one... I didn't even consider that I wouldn't be able to afford to pay off the $3,000 I loaded up on my card when I paid for it, but I couldn't... 10 months later, here I am with $2,600 on a credit card that I've been paying interest on for 10 months. I'm aware of how stupid this is but besides that point, my parents helped me clear that debt today so I wouldn't be paying 28% APR on a credit card...

My goal now is to pay them back immediately. My car is worth about $9,000 on KBB. I have a 700 credit score still on some reports, will do a [annualcreditcheck.com](https://annualcreditcheck.com) shortly to make sure I'm good, but in about a month I'm wanting to get a Clear Title Loan - Immediately pay off as much as I can (let's say they give me $9k, I pay the principle of $6,000 right away, and give my parents $2,600 to balance me out and pay interest on $3,000 over 1-2 years?) Maybe faster depending on my sales commissions... And so I have $400 left from all of that to pay first payment and other expenses I may have...

Does this sound like a solid plan with my main goal to get off my parents books? that is my main goal here.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance Worth It?,"Here's the breakdown. This is my first house, bought it 4 years ago (currently age 31). It likely won't be my last home ever. Not married yet. No kids so it's just a small ranch.

\- Current loan balance $66k

\- Original loan $70.7k

\- Current interest rate 4.25%

\- Currently paying PMI of $18.75 a month

&amp;#x200B;

With rates dropping a bit I'm wondering if the low cost refinance product through my local credit union is worth it. Working with them I have these preliminary figures.

\- Low cost refinance cost is $500

\-  15 year rate is 3.35%, 20 and 30 year are both 3.75%

\- Would not take out additional money. This leaves principal and interest payment at $468 for 15, $392 for 20, $306 for 30.

\- PMI will most likely drop off.

\- Current payment is $364 (principal, interest, and PMI).

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at these numbers I see no reason not to refinance to a 15 year for the best rate, since it's only an extra $100 a month. I feel like the rate could be a bit better, but still not bad. I'd rather not dip into savings to get the couple grand necessary for the regular closing costs.

&amp;#x200B;

I get paid weekly and my bring home right now after taxes, 401k, HSA, insurance, and $50 a week going to automatically to secondary savings is $617. I have a 401k loan I'm looking to pay off in a lump sum by then end of the year, which will bring my weekly take home up to around $650. Plus I'm hoping for another raise in the coming year (not guaranteed since I just got a small one like 2 months ago).

I try to keep a rule of 1 check goes to mortgage, 1 check to other debts, 2 checks for bills, savings and everything else. In any of the refinance scenarios above that rule wouldn't be broken (or if it is it would only be by like 30 bucks).

Opinions?

Does anything change if I consider keeping the house as a rental once it's paid off, or I get a second home to start a family?

personalfinance,What could the impact of negative interest rates be?,"Trump tweeted today about how the Fed should lower interest rates to 0 or lower. If interest rates did become negative, how would that affect the economy at an individual, corporate, and national level? I'm very uninformed on the topic so I have a lot of questions.

It's my understanding that individuals would then have to pay money to keep their money in a bank, but I'm guessing this would be good for corporations since they can take out loans easier (would they get paid to take out loans? Could individuals also get paid to take out loans?). But would it also hurt companies like Apple which has a big cash reserve? 

As far as a federal level goes, how does this impact national debt. I saw some comments that I didn't really understand about how, with negative interest rates, if the Fed were to refinance national debt into longer term maturities, that long term interest rates would rise and the dollar will tank. I don't really understand what exactly refinancing debt into longer term maturities would entail exactly or how that would lead to long term interest rates rising and hyperinflation.

personalfinance,Is a HELOC the best option for my (debt consolidation) situation?,"Hey everyone,

Unfortunately I’m not too great at understanding how this all works so I’m here to get some advice on consolidating debt between my wife and I. Our situation is as follows:

Together, we have three high interest credit cards with a total of about $12k and two personal loans totaling to $16k, for a grand total of $30k in debt. Between minimum payments, we pay right over $1000 /mo in just debt, which is fine but sucks knowing we’re barely making a dent on the credit cards. The personal loans at least have end dates (the smaller is two years from complete, the larger is four), but those do make up a good portion of our monthly debt.

The bright side is that we bought a house a little over two years ago in the greater Seattle area (zero down at the time) that we’ve recently refinanced for a much better interest rate and dropped PMI in the process. Our new mortgage is sitting at $364k and the house appraised for $455k about two months ago, although if you ask me it’s worth closer to $480k but that doesn’t really matter I guess.

Basically, if we were to find and take out a HELOC that offers up to 90% LTV, we could probably get a line open for $50-60k. From what I can tell, we’re looking at interest rates in the 8-9% range (my credit score is sitting at around 740) which really beats the 20% or so interest rates we have on cards and personal loans.

Consolidating all of our debt into a HELOC sounds like a great idea in theory. Draw period would bring our monthly payments down from $1000 to $200 and to $300 during the repayment period. Obviously, paying this debt off ASAP would be our goal, so we would be putting the remaining $800 (and more!) towards it monthly, allowing us to successfully pay off our debt in safely three years, possibly even two years depending on how much extra we could apply towards it. This also sounds appealing because if we ever find ourselves needing to pay for other things (medical bills, car bills, anything unexpected), we could just make the minimum payment for a month or two while we handle that.

Basically, I don’t see why we wouldn’t go this route? Does anyone have any other input on our situation? Considering there’s some scare of a recession happening, is now NOT a good time to be doing something like this? Considering a HELOC is a variable rate during the draw period, would it make more sense to lock in a fixed rate to start or might we expect rates to fall? I’d love any and all thoughts so please feel free to chime in.

personalfinance,"Roth Conversion- Married, spouse in Grad School","Background info:

-Location- US,  Illinois
-Me, employed. Income ~130k annual. 
-Wife, in grad school. No income until 2021. 

My wife has 403b and traditional 401k accounts totaling approximately $78k, and we’d like to convert these to Roth while she’s not earning any income. We’ll be phased out from contributing once she starts her new career (medical field) and waiting to convert would obviously result in everything going into a high tax bracket, so I think now is the time to do it.  

I’ve modeled four scenarios using the 2019 federal brackets, each two years in length:

1. Converting entire balance in 2019 as Married filing jointly. 

2. Converting entire balance in 2019 as married filing separately. 

3. Spreading conversion over two years as married filing jointly

4. Spreading conversion over two years as married filing separately

By my calculations, scenario #3 results in the lowest overall tax liability over the next two years. It would also be easier to stomach taking the hit over two years as opposed to all at once. 

Is there anything else that I should be considering in my analysis?  I’ve also considered leaving some of the account in traditional pre tax accounts as tax rates are historically high, but the fact that we won’t have an option to contribute post-tax again is what is driving my thought process.",finance

Should I wait a while until the balance transfer isn't so recent? Is the balance transfer of no concern? I come from a poor background so I don't have family experience in how to best handle these matters without exacerbating the issue. I took a glance at the refinancing options recommended by Nerd Wallet and the College Investor. If I should move forward with refinancing, I'm unclear how to best compare my options.

The APR makes sense to me: dividing it by 365, multiplying it against the number of days and your cycle, then multiply it against the **Balance Subject to Interest Rate** does equal the interest they list.(also accounting for percentage to decimal conversion)

However, I do not know how to calculate the **Balance Subject to Interest Rate**. As an example I'll use one of my simpler statements.

* Previous Balance: $3,665.80
* Purchase and Adjustments: $635.60
* Payments and Other Credits: -$1,000.00
* Fees Charged: $0.00

Leading me to believe that the Balance my interest is charged against should be

3,665.80 + 635.60 - 1,000 + 0.00 = $3,301.40

But the actual **Balance Subject to Interest Rate** = $3,443.65

I talked to them today and apparently this is due to the interest being calculated daily, but I don't really understand what the math would actually look like. If anyone could shed some light on this I would appreciate it.

APR = 17.24% if you need it for the calculation",finance

personalfinance,"Feeling like quitting my job without two weeks notice, shall I?","Hey there all,

I've been working in the restaurant industry for nearing 6 years now. I started as a busser and worked my way to a server position where I've been for 3 years and I have never enjoyed it.

Management has been a revolving door since day one. The company I work for is losing its morals and values, and I no longer feel proud to work there. There have been 50+ employees turned over JUST in the restaurant I work in, in the short time of 6 years. I feel that this should explain itself.

Anyway, at this point, I have my eyes set on a Web Development career. I have received job offers already and feel as though I could really focus on building my portfolio more over the month following my resignation.

My current resume does NOT include my restaurant gig as a reference. I feel as though I'm only putting in my two weeks here as a polite way to say goodbye to people I don't care about much. The restaurant is a bit short-staffed but is it my responsibility to ease that for them? I don't trust the reference, to begin with, even if they praised me. My manager has the worst demeanor and I don't want him speaking on my behalf.

I'm only worried that a future employer, if I were to use the reference, may find that I quit a 6-year job w/o notice but to me, I feel as though it's justified and explainable. If I were the interviewer, especially in software or web development, I'd understand that they were obviously unhappy and capable of making a decision to enhance their future, but hey that's just me!

I have a check of $1100ish that will cover all my bills for the month and leave me with around $400-500 for the month with some buffer. I just moved in with my father, so rent is not a burden at the moment and they are willing to at least help with a month worth of bills and personal finances; I'm 24 and very very lucky to have supportive parents, as such. 

This seems like a good time as ever to shoot me in the foot like this. My friends at work can't leave because of their mortgages and insurance; I have neither.",finance
personalfinance,Can I consolidate my student loans? Is it possible and how should I do it?,"So here’s the situation. 

Last year, my freshman year of college, I took on 5,500$ of federal student loans and 14,000$ of a private loan (I was paying out of state tuition at the time which was about 16k for two semesters plus the cost of living and materials for school.

This year I got married and qualified for the Pell Grant and in state tuition, so the Pell Grant will be able to cover all of my tuition. I qualified this year for about 1k per semester of subsidized loans and about 3.5k per semester of unsubsidized.

(For those of you worrying about me being married young, I am older than the average college sophomore, before starting college I spent some years working and studying on my own, including two years spent abroad doing humanitarian work, hence the late start on college)

I was planning on only taking the 1k of subsidized loans as I do need a little more help but don’t want to significantly increase my debt. However, I made a mistake while accepting my loan awards through FAFSA and accidentally accepted the whole 4.5k per semester. Now I was thinking I could probably just take the 7k of unsubsidized and immediately repay it, but now I’m wondering, what if I used that 7k towards my private student loan?

Pros of doing this: 

The federal loans have a lower interest rate 

The federal loans have loan forgiveness (I’m studying to be a psychiatrist and can work for a federally owned hospital to get loan forgiveness) 

My Brother co-signed my private loan, so it would reduce his debt to income ratio, which he was asking me to do anyway because he’s planning on purchasing a home this year.

Cons of doing this: 

I don’t know if there’s something I’m not considering that would make this a bad move. 

I don’t know if this is legal.

I’m not sure how to even do it. Can I just make a big payment to my private student loan provider? 

Would this cause me to have to start making monthly payments that would otherwise be deferred till after graduation?",finance

personalfinance,Paying off accounts (CC and Student Loans) in full and affect on credit score?,"Hi all,

So, in the past 6 months, I've started making much better financial decisions, decided to get aggressive about paying off my debt, and perhaps most importantly, secured a \~40% raise that has corresponded to a \~0% spending increase. 

I'm in a position to where I've paid a few of my lower balance cards off and I have 2 cards with relatively high balances that will take \~2-3 months to pay in full. In addition to this, I have 2 separate student loans with relatively low interest rates. 

Beyond minimum payments, higher interest accounts are first (i.e. cc's over loans) obviously.

My questions are these:

1. Once I've paid off a cc in full, whats the best thing to actually do with it? Close it? Let it sit? Have one small recurring charge that I have on auto pay each month? I have a cash back and rewards card I use for all my monthly spending and then pay in full now, so I wont be using them regularly.
2. Of the 2 student loans, one is quite large 50k, one is relatively small 4k and with higher (still low relative to cc) interest. I know I should prioritize the one with higher interest. I'd be able to knock this out by mid 2020 fairly comfortably I think, but oddly, my question is if I rush to pay it off, how will this impact my credit score/worthiness? Yes less debt, but also fewer accounts etc., and would it also lower my average account age? 

Sorry if some of this has been discussed ad nauseam, but as always, thankful for any advice!",finance
personalfinance,"Mom Passed, Terminal Father - How to Inherent House and other questions??","So my dad and I live in Washington state. My dad got diagnosed with a terminal stage 4 cancer about a month ago and has anywhere from 3 months - 1.5 years to live. My mom passed earlier this year suddenly and I'm an only child. So everything is boiling down to me from whatever debts, assets, and any other lingering issues my parents had and I can't find too many clear cut tutorials for someone in my position.  

  

So I have a few questions, if even one gets answered, it would be incredibly helpful:  

  

1. My dad currently owes approx. $100,000 on our house to own it. If he passes, how does it get transferred to me so I don't lose it and go homeless? Like are there any quotas I should meet so the state doesn't deem me financially unsustainable to own it? Like a job earning a certain amount, credit score, liquid cash, potential friends/relatives I could add to the mortgage? I'm in between jobs right now as I have to take my dad to 3-5 appointments a week and care for him throughout the day. I also have no credit, so I'm scared the state won't even sign over the papers seeing I'm earning $0.  

  

2. Is there any life insurance policy that would accept my dad? I'm not trying to scam them, I'll be upfront that he's terminal, but any additional money to smooth the transition of his passing and me accepting the financial weight of being a sudden house owner would help.  

  

3. Is there anything my dad should not do before he passes as it could potentially affect me? Not that we are planning to, but if he happens to open up a credit card for medical bills, then passes away in 3 months, could any of that haunt me?  

  

4. Are there any state/federal lesser-known resources to help me when he passes? Like I know of food stamps, state health insurance, and other well known services, but is there anything like I could cash in their SS early? Or get a waiver on the mortgage payment for a month to transition into paying it?  

  

5. Is now a good time or after my dad passes to transfer any bills into my name? Like cable, electricity, phone, etc. Just trying to get the smoothest transition.  

  

Extra info if any of it matters: I'm 24, only child, unmarried, no kids. Currently jobless, not in school, and I have no credit. No savings. Located in Washington state. My parents will both be under 65 before they pass, so I know survivor benefit SS for now is off the table.",finance

investing,America needs a short term recession and a bear market to reenergize the economy and stock market for the long run,"It seems like our Government is doing everything they can to keep the good times going for many more years.  Government Spending, cut interest rates, etc.

But many economists say that America needs a recession and a bear market on occasion to shake the cobwebs out of our economy.  The stock market can't just keep going up forever.  Stock corrections and even bear markets are good for long term stock growth.  Once stock prices go up too much, many people will sell stocks thinking they are overpriced.  Stock Market Corrections and Bear Markets beat down poor companies and thin the herd of bad companies. Eventually, stocks go back up and reach more highs because people think stocks are on sale.

Even recessions can be good for the economy in the long run because it kills off non-performing companies and forces all organizations to be more competitive and innovative while cutting costs.

I think it is time for a good bear market and recession for the long term good of America.

See the four articles below about how a recession can be good and about the benefits of a stock market correction or even a bear market.

personalfinance,Advice needed: What debt would you pay off first?,"The backstory: I am recently married.  My wife has never had any debt. Her parents paid for college and she was smart in her 20s.  I have debt because I'm an idiot and had a good time in my 20s. We are 34/M (me) and 32/F (her).  I have been informed that I will be losing my job come October 31.  I have a part time gig lined up, which will grow into a full time as business allows (hopefully in around 6 months).  We have money saved away and got quite a bit from the wedding. We'd like to use that money to pay off these debts so that we can alleviate debt while I am under employed.  Here's the rub, I think we should pay off different debts than she does and it's causing arguments.

&amp;#x200B;

Debt: 

1. Personal loan that has just under 13k and is a \~$300 payment monthly. Interest rate is \~10% (I believe, but is definitely less than the credit cards)
2. Credit card 1 that has \~$1500 and is a \~$30 monthly payment. Interest rate is higher, but reasonable for a credit card (I know, I know interest is how they make money on my dumb ass).
3. Credit card 2 that has \~$2000 and is \~$40 per month.  Interest is again, reasonable (see above for 'I know I'm a dumbass' statement).

&amp;#x200B;

We are talking about paying it all off, but she wants to start with the 2 credit cards because the interest is higher.  If we can't do it all, I want to pay off the personal loan because the overall obligation, and monthly obligation, are considerably higher.  Especially with losing my full time job, I believe that $70 dollars a month payments while I get back to full time is better than $300.  I know the interest is higher, but given the lower amounts, I think it's better to keep those.

&amp;#x200B;

We would be keeping a minimum of $1000 emergency fund and using the rest of our savings to start paying debt.  In my opinion, if we pay the larger debt off we have $300 'free' (I can't express enough that until debt is completely eliminated, it's not free.  That's why I used the ') money each month.  When I am under employed, the burden will be less, and if we have money left over in the budget we can put that towards the smaller debts to pay them down faster.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, this is biased towards my opinion, because I am writing it, but I have tried to be fair in my explanation.  Please let me know if you have questions that will help you answer my following question: 

&amp;#x200B;

Which debts would you pay off first? The 1 larger dollar amount with lower interest rate or the 2 lower dollar amounts with higher interest rates?",finance

personalfinance,Requesting Advice on allocation of lump sum refund/reimbursement,"I'm aware that I am not already doing things ""correctly"" by this sub, but I have a financial question that I'm trying to parse in my head and I'm conflicted between what my head and my gut say.

My child completed pre-K and is now in K, the pre-K school had required a deposit of one-month's tuition when we signed up \~3 years ago, I got the refund today for $900.  I intend to use it to pay towards one of our several debts, but I'm not sure the ""wisest"" course of action, and I'm asking for recommendations.

Our/My Debt:  
Student Loans: \~$18k outstanding to NelNet, collectively its around 6% interest, we pay $440 a month which is above the minimum requirement  
Consolidated Debt Loan: \~$22k outstanding to Credit Union, interest is 6.25%, we pay just under $500 a month  
Credit Card Debt: \~$6k outstanding on single card, interest is \~16%, some of this was work related and we will be reimbursed \*someday\* by work, probably half is our own doing and we had a brief spell where someone had skimmed our debit card so we relied on the CC to get by and we usually put plane tickets on it because its branded to our usual airline, we pay $400 a month right now (with lump sum payments as reimbursed)  
Car Loan: \~$2500 outstanding to bank, interest is \~8%, we pay $240 a month, when our fully paid off car exploded we bought an older model van in a hurry and made some... ill advised choices, resulting in our POS vehicle that we now enjoy  


My head says to pay off the car (we have a reimbursement coming soon of \~$1600 and that plus my $900 would essentially pay it off), because then we have $240 a month to allocate to the CC to get it closer to paid off.  


My gut says to pay it to the CC because the high-ish interest rate is just costing us money.  


I would greatly appreciate any recommendations.  My job is stable for at least one more year, my wife's job is stable so long as she wants it.  We make decent money by the numbers but given the HCOL area we live in, theres just a limit to how much we can get ahead.  The Consolidated debt loan has been refinanced a few times, and I think I would like to in the nearish future.  I do lurk on the sub and know that there is good reasons to both get out of the high interest rate first and clear out the smaller amounts to free up money to then snowball into the bigger debt.",finance

I'm coming into sooner cash and my intention was to do a slew of home improvements, including building a garage apartment for additional income. 

Initially I was planning on spending the entirety of the cash on it,  but I then thought that perhaps it's better to sink it into the mortgage and then take a home equity loan for them. 

My reasoning is that the interest rates dropped since we purchased, so our mortgage will be less, and still be able to deduct the interest. since the improvement also includes solar panels, we'd get a deduction for that.

personalfinance,Cashing in vested company shares while living abroad and paying student debt.,"Hello, so I have a somewhat unusual tax situation coming up and I would like to get some guidance on the best way to do things, so here it is.   


I worked for a company during my high school and undergrad years, a company that has ESOP(employee stock ownership program) for employees who have been working long enough. I have since left the company and am currently in my last few years of earning a Ph.D., but I worked long enough to be fully vested and I have been separated from the company long enough that I can access these shares now. Meanwhile, I have used student loans a few times in undergrad and while getting my master's. If I were to cash in the ESOP share, I would have enough to pay off all of my student loans before graduating and entering the ""re-payment"" phase. However, I know that these ESOP accounts are classed as retirement accounts meaning I would be taxed a penalty for cashing in on the funds before retirement age (not to mention the extra tax from this cashed in shares being counted as earned income). Some other possibly relevant information, I currently live in a European country and have been here for more than a year. My biggest hope is that I could use my ESOP money to get rid of my student loans before I graduate, so that I can be free of these, but I don't know if it will be worth it if I get taxed so much in the first place. Also, all of the loans are Federal loans, and about half of them are subsidised loans while the other half are not, so I am actively accruing interest one about half of my loans, while the other half will not gain interest until I am graduated.   


So, here are some of the questions I have:

*  Is there any way around the penalty of cashing in on the ESOP early if you use the money to pay back student loans? I know there are benefits tax wise for paying off student loan interest (maybe capital too?) but I am not familiar with that at all.
* Does it maybe make more sense to cash in the ESOP shares partially and pay off the loans that gain interest only at this time and leave the rest for when I am employed after I graduate?  


I will qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion for US taxes this year, but I doubt that is relevant. Also, I am targeting getting responses from people in the US so I am posting now, but it is quite late already where I am, so I may not respond right away, but I would appreciate any advice.",finance

**Plan**

\- I asked for forbearance on federal school loans, which was granted. Due to my low income during school (Graduate Assistant), I qualified for $0 for a year on my IBR. Begin payments of $285 month next August.

\- I took the initial oath of enlistment within the US Army to take advantage of the Service-members Civil Relief Act (SCRA) which caps previously existing loans at 6%. I ship off to basic in mid-January.

\- Applying SCRA to current apartment, and waiting to see if approved for Wells Fargo (currently on Irregular Ready Reserve) and to credit card. Requested Military Deferment to Wells Fargo, not confirmed.

Once I graduate OCS, then I will at $3,188 not include Off-base housing (roughly $1300 untaxed, depending on locale) and food pay (unsure, but untaxed).

\- While in Basic and in OCS, I am hoping to have my family member monitor my finances and pay as much of the credit card off as quickly as she can. Then tackle the private student loans at 2%, and apply for the PSLF and do that for 10 years.

personalfinance,Got notified of FED EX!?! about some fraud but don’t know what the fraud is yet. The anticipation is killing me,"So got a call today from fed ex asking me to confirm validity of some overnighted envelopes sent from “me”. 

I got the ladies info and then I called the main fed ex line to make sure the call was legit. 

Turns out someone used an address linked to me to open up a fed ex account (not my home address but a family members address that is linked to some of my accounts still) They also used my cell phone number when opening the account which is how fed ex got ahold of me. They used a credit card that the last 4 doesn’t match any of my cc numbers (not mine that I know of unless they used my info to open it and I’m not aware of it yet) 

So apparently they opened the account and used my info to send pricey overnighted envelopes to somewhere. It raised a red flag due to the state they shipped from not matching my state of residence and they also said they’ve been seeing a high number of similar situations lately. Fed ex called me. I told them they are fraudulent and asked for more info on what was in the letters. They told me they have to send them to their fraud department and I could call back to “try” to get more info. 

I’m worried about what’s in these letters that they paid a high price to overnight (must be important)

Worried if my socials in there, bank info, etc. Also worried they could be loan applications or if they’re trying to open up credit lines. 

In response I opened a credit karma account (everything looks fine as of now) and I called one of the credit agencies and put a fraud alert on my account. 

What’s next? What further steps should I take to prevent potential fraud ? 

I feel like they have to be up to something seriously damaging to take the time and money to open an account with fed ex in my name with my personal info and pay the price to overnight them.

Any idea what they’re up to?

personalfinance,ELI5: Why is tax-deferment in a traditional IRA beneficial?,"Hello! I am a mid 20's pharmacy intern fairly new to investing. I maxed out my company 401(k) match, which is a 100% match for the first 5% of each paycheck. I also maxed out my Roth IRA contributions each year. After these two investments, I don't fully understand why it is beneficial to contribute anything more to a traditional 401(k) to try and max it out to $19,000 since that is what I have been reading.

At my income right now, I am taxed 22% federal and 8% state (California) which is almost certainly be lower than when I retire as a pharmacist in which I would most likely be taxed 24% federal and 9.3% state. If this is the case, why would I even want to defer my tax payments through a traditional 401(k)? Shouldn't I just pay a lower amount of taxes now rather than pay a higher amount of taxes when I am bumped up to a higher tax bracket later on in life?

personalfinance,Bank says I'm too far ahead of schedule on loan repayment,"I'm just baffled. 
tl;dr bank says I'm repaying wrong / too fast.

I received a letter today, dated Sept 1, 2019, from my bank. The important bit is:

""Recently, your loan was identified as having been paid ahead of schedule, beyond our allowed time frame of 90 days from the current due date. As stated in your signed [Agreement], you may prepay any amount without penalty. However, you are still required to make the regularly scheduled payments. This requirement ensures that the loan stays on schedule to be paid down based on the terms found in the original agreement. It also prevents a large accrual of interest charges, which can be a violation of Federal regulations. As a result, your due date has been adjusted to 11/20/2019.""

My goal is to pay off my car and make good credit history. I have the cash to pay off the loan in full, but someone told me I should keep a loan account open for at least two years to reflect well on my credit.

Therefore, around month 9 of the 4yr loan, I started to make large payments, roughly 2.5x the required payment. Later, I changed my payment strategy, recalling something about split payments reducing the interest you pay, which seems to be true, saving me a few dollars per month. Note that my split payments are each larger than the required monthly payment.

So, what's the bank's problem?

Are they butthurt that I'm costing them interest? They are ok if I make large payments but not split payments? I'm guessing they are interpreting the split payments as regular payments and so they think they are stacking up. 

Should I just pay it off to end the BS, or is there value in keeping the loan account open for that 2-year period?",finance

investing,Surge of inflows into US small-caps stirs hope for sector,"IWM

[https://www.ft.com/content/20f0fb44-d3db-11e9-a0bd-ab8ec6435630](https://www.ft.com/content/20f0fb44-d3db-11e9-a0bd-ab8ec6435630) 

Bargain hunters have piled back into US small-cap stocks, taking advantage of their cheapest relative valuation to their large-cap peers in a decade and a half, as concerns about a recession ease.

In the week ended September 6, investors poured $1.5bn into the biggest exchange traded fund tracking companies with a smaller market capitalisation, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF, for its largest weekly inflow in almost a year.

That followed a $340m inflow in the final days of August, which put an end to four consecutive weeks of net withdrawals — the longest streak of outflows since early 2018.

The rebound comes amid a broader rotation into cheaper equities and away from “defensives” and bond-proxy stocks that built up momentum over a tumultuous summer.

Over the past few months, nervous investors had dumped riskier assets and sought havens such as US Treasuries. This pushed yields on the latter to record lows in August and prompted one indicator of an impending recession to flash its strongest signal since the financial crisis, as the 2-year bond yield exceeded its 10-year equivalent.

The market unease drove the valuation of the Russell 2000 to its lowest relative to large-cap equities since June 2003, according to Jefferies. The investment bank forecast that small-cap stocks would outperform their larger cousins by 6 percentage points over the next year, following a 14 percentage point underperformance over the past 12 months.

“They’re down on their butts,” said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies. “But you get a bit of positive reprieve around growth globally and no recession for the US, and \[small-caps\] are going to do well.”

Repeated headlines about the US-China trade war have contributed to volatility over the summer, as has confusion over the Federal Reserve’s outlook for interest rates.

“We wouldn’t want to be fighting a Fed that is looking to be more accommodative over the coming quarters and into an election year,” said Chris Retzler, manager of the small-cap growth fund at Needham Asset Management.

Lower interest rates have historically been supportive of small-cap equities. Over the past six decades they have risen an average of 28 per cent in the first 12 months after the start of a Fed rate cut cycle, compared with 15 per cent for large-caps, according to Jefferies.

The Fed’s rate cut in July, its first since the financial crisis, and a recent steepening of the yield curve rekindled bullish spirits and has pushed the S&amp;P 500 to within 2 per cent of a record high. Whether it will also be enough to drive the Russell 2000 past its peak of August 2018 remains to be seen. The index is down about 11 per cent from that mark.

Craig Stone, small-cap portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick, said that after a fairly narrow market rally over the past 12 to 18 months, there needs to be a broadening-out of gains for indices to continue their record run. “I think it’s a possibility but, at the end of the day, earnings growth drives returns and we do have to have a better economy for that to happen.”

Profits for small-cap companies are expected to contract 3.5 per cent this year, compared with a 1 per cent rise for large-caps, according to Jefferies figures. In theory, that has already been factored into prices, so if companies’ profit downgrades in the upcoming earnings season are less dire than Wall Street forecasts, small-cap stocks could still move higher.",finance

personalfinance,"Analysis of finances (car loan, mortgage)","Hi everyone, first time posting here so apologies if I ask any obvious questions. I'm thinking of buying a house soon-ish and was wondering if PF has any insights or opinions on my situation.

Here's my current financial situation. I'm projected to earn approximately 150k per year before taxes right now and am maxing out my 401k along with monthly expenses of about 2k, 600$ in food + misc and 1400$ for rent and utilities (yeah I know :/). I have paid off all of my student loans and owe some family members approximately 48k that are fairly flexible with me paying them back at 0% interest (although it weighs on my mind as I dislike owing people money). I have about 26k saved up right now.

I very recently bought a used car for 14k and fully financed it thinking I was going to just pay it all off. The interest rate that I have on that loan is currently 3.79%. I planned it out so that I would have 12k left after paying off the loan and that would be my 6 month's worth of emergency funds. After taxes and taking out the 19k from the 401k, I believe I will have approximately 100k take home pay per year. With monthly expenses adding to approximately 25k and around 10-15k supporting my parents and trips back home to visit them, I'm looking at about saving 50\~60k per year.

From my point of view, the biggest expense that I can affect is my monthly rent. I am thinking that buying a house/condo/townhouse would change my rent from going to oblivion to building equity. Looking at the housing market, I see that prices are going down around me but they still start at around 700k right now, making it fairly tough to crack the 20% down payment required.

My FICO score is around 780-ish and my recent car purchase's credit pull yielded a score of 774. I'm currently thinking of making large monthly payments on the car to pay it off in 12 months so my credit report will show installments to help lower mortgage rates. By the end of next year, I should have close to 100k saved up to make a decent dent on the down payment and proceed with that plan.

I have time to do all this and I would like to maximize my wealth in the smartest way possible so I would love any input of perspectives of people in more advanced stages of their lives and in similar situations. I'm definitely open to scrapping my entire plan and following a different path. Thanks for reading!",finance

Administration looking for ways to take advantage of low rates to reduce debt-servicing costs

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said ‘we think there is some demand’ for a 50-year U.S. bond. 

The Treasury Department is “very seriously considering” issuing a 50-year Treasury bond next year, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday, as the Trump administration looks to take greater advantage of low interest rates to slow soaring borrowing costs.

The Treasury said last month it was once again exploring the possibility of issuing debt with maturities beyond 30 years, after considering and then dropping the idea in 2017.

“We think there is some demand for it,” Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC. “There’s some technology issues we need to make sure we have in place, there’s market issues. But we would do this in a way that if there is demand, it’s something that we would meet.”

Debt-servicing costs are one of the fastest-growing drivers of federal spending, amid large annual federal budget deficits. Interest payments have increased nearly 10% so far this fiscal year, totaling $497.2 billion over the 10-month period through July, roughly $1.6 billion a day, according to the Treasury Department.

President Trump, as part of his pressure campaign on Federal Reserve policy makers, argued on Wednesday that further short-term rate cuts would help lower government borrowing costs.  

Reacting on Twitter to a rate cut by the European Central Bank on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump said of European governments: “They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!”

In Thursday’s move, the ECB cut its key interest rate by 0.1 percentage point, to minus 0.5%.  

The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate in July by a quarter percentage point to its current range between 2% and 2.25%, and officials are set to cut rates again, likely by another quarter point, at their Sept. 17-18 policy meeting.

For the U.S. government, issuing bonds with ultralong maturities holds obvious appeal at a time when interest rates are near historic lows. Wall Street, however, has in the past showed little interest in the idea.

Mr. Mnuchin said he thinks it would be good thing to expand the U.S. government’s borrowing capabilities.

“It’s obviously quite attractive for us to extend and de-risk the U.S. Treasury borrowings, so we’re also looking at extending the weighted average maturity of the Treasury borrowings to de-risk this for the U.S. people,” he said.

Asked whether the government could issue enough long-term debt to make much of a difference in already low borrowing costs, Mr. Mnuchin said the Treasury would look at the difference in yields between 30-year bonds and a potential 50-year bond.

“We would only issue if we thought we could do it at an appropriate spread, but innovation is an important thing,” he said. “If there is market demand, this is something we’re seriously considering.”

Mr. Mnuchin said the Treasury had reached out to investors and would soon begin speaking with foreign governments about the idea.",finance

personalfinance,Using debt snowball but investing into mutual funds to outpace the loan then paying off student loans in the same period?,"So it was recently suggested to me that a mutual fund could outpace the student loans we have to pay off (about 30k at avg 4.7% interest rate).
The idea would be to, instead of using debt snowball to pay loans in three years, pay minimums on the loans and put the rest in mutual funds and then pay off the loans at the end of three years.
I haven't don't the math on it, but it seems like it could possibly check out since mutual funds grow compoundingly and loans don't. This would mean that the mutual fund should generate more than what is needed to pay off the student loan by the three year mark (so double using the money basically). However, I'm leary about doing the mutual fund route for a few reasons: mainly that I don't know much about mutual funds and the fees and taxes associated with them.

Have any of you tried this route for paying off student loans? Is this a bad suggestion and I haven't dug deep enough to find out why? 


Tldr: It was suggested that instead of debt snowball I could use mutual fund to outpace student loan and still pay off loan in same amount of time while having extra money still in the mutual fund. Does this check out?

Edit: thank you for your input, so I've learned that it seems like a good idea of you can predict the market... But since you can't, you can't be sure that mutual funds would actually outpace the loans or not and if they don't, then you've lost money or you will have the loans longer to try to recoup losses.",finance

personalfinance,Any experience with refunds from dentists?,"I'm not sure if this is best asked here or maybe at r/dentistry, but so basically, my dentist charged full price for a procedure I should have been charged at a contracted rate for, which is apparently not unusual in itself, but I had to sort of hound them to get the refund, calling them once a week for more than a month and getting kind of a runaround. During that time different people I spoke to said I could either get it refunded onto whichever credit card I wanted that I'd paid with or a check mailed to my house. Actually, yesterday was when they finally had all the information they needed to refund  me, and the lady I spoke with then told me to expect a check in the mail. Well, this morning I got called back from that same employee, and apparently the financial officer there told her that they can't put a refund onto anything but the card that I paid for the majority of the procedure. 

Unfortunately, that card is one that doesn't have any interest, and I was really hoping to get that refund onto the other card (or as a check I could then use to pay that card with), which has a rather high interest rate.  It was an emergency procedure that I couldn't pay for without that interest-bearing card, so when I found out that they overcharged me I was rather excited to hear I would be getting a refund I could pay a big chunk down onto that card with. :\\

I'm wondering, does anyone else have experience in this situation, or or does anyone maybe work in dentistry billing? Was your dentist also restricted like this when you received a refund? I've never worked with a business where they couldn't refund it onto your choice of card, and I'm not very impressed with the way this office has been handling the billing issues in general, so I'm curious if this is a real/normal restriction or if they're taking me for a ride.",finance

personalfinance,CPA or Tax Attorney for Unfiled Taxes,"So my parents didn't file federal or state taxes between like 2006 and 2012. Regardless of why they never filed those years, they have now been notified that their bank account will be garnished for the tax years between 2006 and 2010 for state taxes. 

They got the initial notice a few months ago showing a judgement against them for like $14k which was calculated as if they paid no taxes. So my dad called the state revenue agency to see what he needed to do for the judgement to be reduced since they paid taxes through the years but just didn't file them. They said he just needed to file for the years that were included in the judgement, so I helped him fill out the paperwork for those years and there ended up only being like $500 of unpaid taxes plus whatever late fees and interest would be calculated. 

Anyways, the original wage garnishment was delayed because the wage garnishment notice was sent to an old employer. Well for some reason my dad never mailed in the returns I helped him fill out (don't ask me why, my parents are a mess), and the judgement has now caught up with them and has been awarded for garnishment straight from their bank account instead of through an employer. 

So as it stands, I think it is bit late for them to just file the returns for those years to have the judgement lowered based on taxes that were actually paid since the garnishment has already been awarded. My question is would it be better for my parents to go to a tax attorney or a cpa under these circumstances? 

My dad has already talked to a tax attorney that says based on the information he gave over the phone they could get the garnishment stopped and the taxes sorted out for a flat rate of $3000 since they haven't actually avoided taxes and just failed to file. I am assuming the tax attorney firm has in house cpa's that would be filing all of the back taxes, and I am not sure if going directly to a cpa could accomplish the same thing without the added expense of the lawyer. If it weren't for the wage garnishment already being put in place I would have just recommended they see a cpa. 

I appreciate any advice anyone has about this and will give any extra info if needed. This is in Ohio if it matters.",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing student loan using both spouse income?,"Hi all, I tried searching if this question has come up before but can't find it. So here is the detail

Wife Student loan: $35,000
Interest rate: approx 6%. I say approx as it's a bunch of small loans some as low as 3% some as high as 7%. All federal loans, some were subsidized. 

We want to refinance it as fixed student loan rates seem very low, I am seeing 3.29% for 5 years. But the wrinkle is my wife job has not been as stable as mine (she is actually not working in the major she studied).
  
Flip side I make a lot more and have been employed for over 10 years (and no student loan thank God I got grants) 

We spoke with one lender and when it got to underwriters they jump the rate to 4.5% saying they are not going to use my income but only my wife's income.  Which seems odd as I am a cosigner and liable for the loan but my income can't help the rate.

personalfinance,"If you're trapped in a high interest debt cycle, talk with a credit union.","I wanted to post my story because it may help someone who feels shackled by high interest debt. 

As the result of a series of poor choices, I ended up with high interest debt (from more than one lender) that left me living barely paycheck-to-paycheck. The total amount of debt wasn't even that large, but the interest rate meant that I was paying about $900/month on a 60K annual salary. It wasn't sustainable at all. 

I wanted to consolidate my loans into one with a lower interest rate, but was having trouble getting a loan because my credit isn't stellar either (which is how I ended up with those high interest rates to begin with). I was raised in a household where money was not really discussed, and where it was a source of stress more often than not. I thought that was just how things were until I began educating myself on budgeting and everything else, via this community and others. I couldn't remember a time when I truly felt relaxed because this was constantly hanging over my head. 

Realizing I could be proactive and take charge of my financial future was the first step. I then decided to get in touch with a credit union to see if I could work with them to get a loan for a lower interest rate. I reached out to one credit union and was declined, but the second credit union I got in touch with worked with me and provided me with a loan consolidating all of my debt that will lower my monthly payment to a manageable $130/month. I will be paying more than this each month to pay it off as quickly as possible. 

I want others to know if you feel trapped there can be options out there for you. I realize I'm luckier than some; I have a full time job and make decent money. Still, when you feel like you've exhausted your options, it can feel hopeless. 

If you are in this situation, I highly recommend seeing if a local credit union will work with you. Even if they are unable to directly help, in my experience they will try to guide you in the right direction. The first credit union I called told me about a different type of loan that I wouldn't have known about if I hadn't called them. Everyone I spoke with at the credit unions was super friendly, too, which made an otherwise stressful situation so much better. I know I'm not completely out of debt yet, but I'm in a much better place and have a solid budget and plan in place to make great choices in the future.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay estimated taxes this year?,"Hello!
I have been doing some reading up on estimated taxes and it's looking to me like I don't technically have to pay them this year and that I can just pay my tax all together during tax season. I'm wanting to double check that I'm reading it all correctly. I'm also wondering if there would be any benefit to going ahead and paying estimated taxes.

I am a newly self-employed independent contractor as of July 1, 2019. Prior to this, I was a student with no job or income. I had zero tax liability for 2018 (I am also a US citizen and I assume I'm on a 12-month tax year?). From my research, this means I would not have a penalty if I did not pay estimated federal taxes this year.

I live and work in Indiana and my research for my state taxes isn't as clear to me. It almost seems like I would need to pay my estimated state taxes even if I am not required to for my federal. Does it look sketchy to pay estimated state taxes but not estimated federal taxes? 

I set money aside for my taxes each time I get paid, so I am prepared to pay estimated payments if need be, but with what I've read I would have to do annualized payments since my income did not begin until July 2019. Does this sound right? It seems to me that it would just be simpler to pay all of my taxes for 2019 all together during tax season and then begin my quarterly estimated payments in 2020.

The U.S. budget gap widened to more than $1 trillion in the first 11 months of the fiscal year, the first time deficits have topped that mark since 2012

WASHINGTON—The U.S. budget gap widened to more than $1 trillion in the first 11 months of the fiscal year, the Treasury Department said Thursday, the first time year-to-date deficits have topped that amount in seven years.

Higher spending on the military, rising interest expenses on government debt and weak revenues early in the fiscal year combined to push the deficit up 19% from October through August, compared with the same period a year earlier. Government spending climbed 7%, to $4.1 trillion, outpacing higher federal tax receipts, which grew 3%, to $3.1 trillion.

That brought the total deficit to $1.07 trillion so far in fiscal 2019, which started Oct. 1, or 4.4% as a share of gross domestic product.

The last time the U.S. recorded a budget gap of that magnitude in the first 11 months of the fiscal year was in August 2012, when the deficit totaled $1.16 trillion, a period when the U.S. was still climbing out of a deep recession. Deficits began to decline soon after amid concerns about rising red ink, after Republicans and Democrats agreed to cut spending and let certain tax cuts expire.

No such agreement is on the horizon now, and forecasters project trillion-dollar annual deficits for decades to come.

A strong economy typically leads to narrower deficits, as rising household income and corporate profits help boost tax collections, while spending on safety-net programs such as unemployment insurance tends to decline.

The U.S. economy has been growing for 10 years as of July, the longest economic expansion on record. Yet annual U.S. deficits are on track to exceed $1 trillion starting this year, due in part to the 2017 tax law, which constrained federal revenue collection last year, and a 2018 budget deal that busted spending caps enacted in 2011.

Senior Treasury officials attributed this year’s higher deficit primarily to a surge in government spending, and emphasized that federal revenues have climbed nearly 7% since May, in large part reflecting a robust economy and low unemployment. Corporate tax revenue in particular has rebounded in recent months, after a period when analysts were unsure why it was running below Congressional Budget Office projections.

Still, revenue growth has continued to lag the broader economy, and is below where forecasters projected it would be prior to the 2017 tax cuts.

Federal spending has continued to climb. The Treasury said Thursday spending on the military and interest costs on government debt each rose 9% from October through August, and Medicare expenses increased 10%.

It’s not yet clear whether the deficit will exceed $1 trillion for the full fiscal year, because the government usually collects more revenue in September than it spends, which could bring the overall figure down. The White House Office of Management and Budget in July projected the deficit would hit $1 trillion by the end of September, while the CBO last month said it expected a total deficit of $960 billion in fiscal 2019.

Rising deficits have led the Treasury to ramp up borrowing in recent years. The government said it expected to borrow more than $1 trillion for the second year in a row in 2019. Government debt held by the public has risen from $14.4 trillion at the start of the Trump administration, to nearly $17 trillion today, a 19% increase.

President Trump and Congress have reached a spending deal that avoids a crisis on the debt ceiling but adds significantly to the federal budget deficit. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains why the new agreement may focus attention on runaway government spending. Photo: AP (Originally published July 24, 2019)
Markets have responded to the increased issuance with a shrug, and interest rates remain at historic lows amid steady demand from investors. Still, a swelling debt load has increased the government’s debt-servicing costs, one of the fastest-growing parts of the budget.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday the government was considering financing options that could reduce borrowing costs, including introducing a 50-year bond and lengthening the maturity of Treasury borrowing.

President Trump, as part of his pressure campaign on Federal Reserve policy makers, argued on Wednesday that further short-term rate cuts would also help lower government borrowing costs.

Reacting on Twitter to a rate cut by the European Central Bank on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump said of European governments: “They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!”

Some economists are skeptical that pushing interest rates to zero, as he called for, would lead to lower interest costs on government debt.

More broadly, annual deficits are projected to more than double as a share of the economy over the coming decades, as a wave of retiring baby boomers pushes up federal spending on retirement and health-care benefits.

CBO last month increased its expectations for deficits over the next decade after Congress and the White House reached a new two-year budget deal that would boost federal spending more than $300 billion above spending caps enacted in 2011.

The deal will add roughly $1.7 trillion to deficits between 2020 and 2029, assuming federal spending continues to rise by the rate of inflation beyond 2021. Much of that increase will be offset, however, by lower-than-expected interest rates, which will reduce the cost of servicing the government’s swelling debt by $1.4 trillion over the next decade, the CBO said.",finance
personalfinance,Drowning in Student Loan debt and can't see a way out,"I'm not sure where to begin, so I'll just put it all out there. I'm at a loss for what to do. I'm currently 180k in student loan debt, mostly to private lenders (Sallie Mae and Discover) but some federal loans as well (more manageable). My parents are cosigners on all of these loans, and help me where they can, but they're struggling too. If they weren't co-signers, I would 100% consider defaulting and either filing for bankruptcy or just accepting that my credit score will suffer, because as it stands it's already pretty bad (mostly because of debt to income ratio).

In terms of my annual income, I make 47k a year, working 50-60 hours a week, paid Bi-monthly (15th and 30th). Which absolutely blows, because at least a week per month, I end up with less than $50 in my bank account while I wait for the next pay cycle. The job is in my field of study, which is good because at least my college degree isn't totally going to waste, but this is a field that is notoriously low paying for lower level employees.  

If I look at my monthly expenses (minus the student loans), it all seems pretty manageable. My rent is about 1350 a month, and I have a car payment of $300. But other than that, the small bills are negligible 

When it comes to the student loans, I really have no idea what to do. I've been denied for most refinancing options, and consolidation efforts, as my debt to income ratio is too high. This is the same reason I haven't been approved for a credit card either (which would help with dealing with the bi-monthly pay cycle). I've spoken to my boss and the higher ups at my company, and while I got a small pay bump after a year, it really hasn't helped the situation much. One of the higher-ups actually told me I should try to extend my line of credit to get by (LOL) 

Does anyone have any help or advice? I'm truly lost and have no idea what to do. At this point, I'd honestly kill myself to escape the loans, but because my parents are cosigners, they'd end up being stuck with the bill, so thats not ideal.

Edit: It's frustrating that I even have to say this, but I understand that I fucked up with taking out this amount of student loans. Don't you think I realize this already? The amount of comments shitting on me for doing so is frustrating and not what I came here for. I came here for advice on how to move forward into the future, not sit here kicking myself for going to an expensive private university that I foolishly thought would push me further into my career by now.",finance

personalfinance,When to buy car outright vs. loan?,"For the past decade+ I’ve balanced frugal with comfort/reliability/safety car-wise: I drive around 300 miles for work each week, in 2006 I bought a Honda Civic new, I still have it at 202k miles, it gets pretty good gas mileage, and is quite reliable and safe and comfortable. But it’s starting to get towards the point where I will need a replacement car in the next couple years. 

I’m looking at a few different cars in the range of $17k to $28k — I’m not looking for recommendations on cars. What I am looking for is advice on whether to pay it outright or to take out a loan. Some facts about me...
* My age is early 40s. 
* I have a full-time job with benefits including retirement plan. 
* My yearly salary is in the $50k’s. 
* I have 3.5 times my yearly salary in my retirement plan and Roth IRA, so not really accessible.
* I have another 4 times my yearly salary in a combination of a high yield savings account (that takes a couple days to get money out of to spend) and other more easily accessible checking/savings. 
* I expect to buy the new car in 1-5 years. 
* I am hoping to buy my first house in 5-10 years. 
* My credit score is currently in the low 800s. 

When I bought my current car, I took out a 5-year loan without penalty for paying off early and paid it in two years. While I could have bought it outright then too, at the time I figured it would help my credit score to get the loan and pay it off, and it would have taken out almost half of my savings. Now I don’t know if I need the credit boost of the loan, and paying outright wouldn’t hurt my savings as much. I can see what the loan interest rates are, I haven’t looked into that yet. 

So my questions...
1) Would the loan help or hurt my credit score much? 
2) Would it potentially make things worse for a mortgage in 5-10 years? 
3) Anything else I should consider regarding paying outright vs getting a loan? 
4) In sum, which do y’all recommend, paying outright or a loan?

Should I put my excess payment towards the loan at the bottom with the highest daily accrued interest (and thus highest monthly accured interest)? 

Loan is $5968, 3.51% interest rate. $9.19 current accrued interest and ~$0.57 per day daily compounded interest.

Or, Should I put my excess payment towards the $3747 loan with the highest interest rate?

Loan is $3747 with a 4.41% interest rate. $7.24 current accrued interest and ~$0.42 per day daily compounded interest.

My thought is if I pay off the loan that has the current highest accrued interest, I will pay less over time in interest. I keep reading that I should put excess payment towards the loan with the highest **interest rate** first. When I think I should be putting excess payment towards the loan with the highest **accrued interest** 

Of course the loan with the highest total accrued interest will change back and forth as time goes on.

Thanks for the help!

personalfinance,Settling medical debt - How will it affect my credit? Is it worth it?,"Hi there folks! 

Without getting too into my life story, I want to preface this post with a small bit of background info. I am a 28 F who grew up without parents, and was raised by a family member who was extremely loving but absolutely horrible at managing money. For context, I had to finish out high school living alone without any family around (my family member lost her job and had to move out-of-state with her sister, and I chose not leave the state since I was 18). 

During ages 18-22  I pretty much worked minimum wage jobs and faffed around irresponsibly. I had no health insurance and never made enough to save any significant amount of money. I ended up going to community college and then University from 22-28, having just finished grad school this May. In August, I passed the national licensing exam for my profession and I am currently looking for a clinical position in a hospital setting. 

In the meantime, I've been working at a local coffee shop making about $1500/month (I know, certainly a small amount to earn each month!). At this point, I'm deeply concerned about my financial wellbeing and want to get my shit together before I get any older. Having had no role models or family to teach me about finances, I feel like I'm totally in the dark. Here's my current situation for all you savvy, brilliant humans:

&amp;#x200B;

My current credit score is \~650. I have $72k in student loan debt which is in deferment until November (I know, terrible move but I was determined to get an education and didn't realize how dumb it is to borrow such insanely large quantities of money until late in my college career). I have about $12k left on my car, which my partner and I share. The remaining debt is medical debt from hospital visits I made during my late teens/early 20's when I was uninsured. One account has been in collections for awhile (total \~$1200); when I called the collection agency, they informed me they had just received another account from 2014 for around $800 that has not yet been reported to the credit bureaus. 

The collection agency told me I could settle both accounts for \~$630. I think after a couple coffee shop paychecks, I will have enough money to settle these medical accounts. However, after some google searching, it seems that settling medical debt for less than the full amount can negatively affect my credit. What gives? The two debts are from 2014 and 2015, though only one has been sent to collections (I believe the other will be sent to collections soon too). 

If settling these accounts will hurt my score, why would I pay them when the negative information is already there and still hurting my score? Also, is there a maximum amount of time that delinquent accounts can be reported? For example, if the debt is from 2014, will negative information eventually drop off? Or can they continue to sell the debt and keep reporting it as new? 

I expect to make around \~45k/yr in an entry-level position, which I hope to secure before the end of the year. Student loans are daunting enough, and I know once my grace period ends my monthly expenses are going to skyrocket. I just want to be smart about how I approach all my debt and eventually have a good credit score. Does anyone have any feedback, advice, criticism, anything that might guide me?

Bitcoin,Technical: Pay-to-contract and Sign-to-contract,"What's this?  I don't make a Technical post for a month and now BitPay is censoring the Hong Kong Free Press?  Shit I'm sorry, it's all my fault for not posting a Technical post regularly!!  Now posting one so that we have a censorship-free Bitcoin universe!

Pay-to-contract and sign-to-contract are actually cryptographic techniques to allow you to embed a commitment in a public key (pay-to-contract) or signature (sign-to-contract).  This commitment  can be revealed independently of the public key / signature without leaking your private key, and the existence of the commitment does not prevent you from using the public key / signature as a normal pubkey/signature for a normal digital signing algorithm.

Both techniques utilize *elliptic curve homomorphism*.  Let's digress into that a little first.

## Elliptic Curve Homomorphism

Let's get an oversimplified view of the maths involved first.

First, we have two ""kinds"" of things we can compute on.

1. One kind is ""scalars"".  These are just very large single numbers.    Traditionally represented by small letters.
2.  The other kind is ""points"".  These are just pairs of large numbers.  Traditionally represented by large letters.

Now, an ""Elliptic Curve"" is just a special kind of curve with particular mathematical properties.  I won't go into those properties, for the very reasonable reason that I don't actually understand them (I'm not a cryptographer, I only play one on reddit!).

If you have an Elliptic Curve, and require that all points you work with are on some Elliptic Curve, then you can do these operations.

1.  Add, subtract, multiply, and divide scalars.  Remember, scalars are just very big numbers.  So those basic mathematical operations still work on big numbers, they're just big numbers.
2.  ""Multiply"" a scalar by a point, resulting in a point.  This is written as a * B, where a is the scalar and B is a point.  This is not just multiplying the scalar to the point coordinates, this is some special Elliptic Curve thing that I don't understand either.
3.  ""Add"" two points together.  This is written as A + B.  Again, this is some special Elliptic Curve thing.

The important part is that if you have:

    A = a * G
    B = b * G
    Q = A + B

Then:

    q = a + b
    Q = q * G

That is, if you add together two points that were each derived from multiplying an arbitarry scalar with the same point (G in the above), you get the same result as adding the scalars together first, then multiplying their sum with the same point will yield the same number.  Or:

    a * G + b * G = (a + b) * G

And because multiplication is just repeated addition, the same concept applies when multiplying:

    a * (b * G) = (a * b) * G = (b * a) * G = b * (a * G)

Something to note in particular is that there are few operations on points.  One operation that's missing is ""dividing"" a point by a point to yield a scalar.  That is, if you have:

    A = a * G

Then, if you know A but don't know the scalar a, you can't do the below:

    a = A / G

You can't get a even if you know both the points A and G.

In Elliptic Curve Cryptography, scalars are used as private keys, while points are used as public keys.  This is particularly useful since if you have a private key (scalar), you can derive a public key (point) from it (by multiplying the scalar with a certain standard point, which we call the ""generator point"", traditionally G).  But there is no reverse operation to get the private key from the public key.

## Commitments

Let's have another mild digression.

Sometimes, you want to ""commit' to something that you want to keep hidden for now.  This is actually important in some games and so on.  For example, if you are paying a game of Twenty Questions, one player must first write the object they are thinking of, then fold or hide it in such a way that what they wrote is not visible.  Then, after the guessing player has asked twenty questions to narrow down what the object is and has revealed what he or she thinks the object being guessed was, the guessee reveals the object by unfodling and showing the paper.

The act of writing down *commits* you to the specific thing you wrote down.  Folding the paper and/or hiding it, err, *hides* what you wrote down.  Later, when you unfold the paper, you *reveal* your commitment.

The above is the analogy to the development of cryptographic commitments.

1.  First you select some thing --- it could be anything, a song, a random number, a promise to deliver products and services, the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.
2.  You *commit* to it by giving it as input to a one-way function.  A one-way function is a function which allows you to get an output from an input, but after you perform that there is no way to reverse it and determine the original input knowing only the final output.  Hash functions like SHA are traditionally used as one-way functions.  As a one-way function, this *hides* your original input.
3.  You give the commitment (the output of the one-way function given your original input) to whoever wants you to commit.
4.  Later, when somebody demands to show what you committed to (for example after playing Twenty Questions), you *reveal* the commitment by giving the original input to the one-way function (i.e. the thing you selected in the first step, which was the thing you wanted to commit to).
5.  Whoever challenged you can *verify* your commitment by feeding your supposed original input to the same one-way function.  If you honestly gave the correct input, then the challenger will get the output that you published above in step 3.

### Salting

Now, sometimes there are only a few possible things you can select from.
For example, instead of Twenty Questions you might be playing a Coin Toss Guess game.

What we'd do would be that, for example, I am the guesser and you the guessee.  You select either ""heads"" or ""tails"" and put it in a commitment which you hand over to me.  Then, I say ""heads"" or ""tails"" and have you reveal your commitment.  If I guessed correctly I win, if not you win.

Unfortunately, if we were to just use a one-way function like an SHA hash function, it would be very trivial for me to win.  All I would need to do would be to try passing ""heads"" and ""tails"" to the one-way function and see which one matches the commitment you gave me.  Then I can very easily find out what your committed value was, winning the game consistently.  In hacking, this can be made easier by making Rainbow Tables, and is precisely the technique used to derive passwords from password databases containing hashes of the passwords.

The way to solve this is to add a *salt*.  This is basically just a large random number that we prepend (or append, order doesn't matter) to the actual value you want to commit to.  This means that not only do I have to feed ""heads"" or ""tails"", I also have to guess the large random number (the salt).  If the possible space of large random numbers is large enough, this prevents me from being able to peek at your committed data.  The salt is sometimes called a *blinding factor*.

## Pay-to-contract

Hiding commitments in pubkeys!

Pay-to-contract allows you to publish a public key, whose private key you can derive, while also being a cryptographic commitment.  In particular, your private key is also used to derive a salt.

The key insight here is to realize that ""one-way function"" is not restricted to hash functions like SHA.  The operation below is an example of a one-way function too:

    h(a) = a * G

This results in a point, but once the point (the output) is known, it is not possible to derive the input (the scalar a above).  This is of course restricted to having the input be a scalar only, instead of an arbitrary-length message, but you can add a hash function (which can accept an arbitrary-length input) and then make its output (a fixed-length scalar) as the scalar to use.

First, pay-to-contract requires you to have a public and private keypair.

    ; p is private key
    P = p * G
    ; P is now public key

Then, you have to select a *contract*.  This is just any arbitrary message containing any arbitrary thing (it could be an object for Twenty Questions, or ""heads"" or ""tails"" for Coin Toss Guessing).  Traditionally, this is symbolized as the small letter s.

In order to have a pay-to-contract public key, you need to compute the below from your public key P (called the *internal public key*; by analogy the private key p is the *internal private key*):

    Q = P + h(P | s) * G

""h()"" is any convenient hash function, which takes anything of arbitrary length, and outputs a scalar, which you can multiply by G.  The syntax ""P | s"" simply means that you are prepending the point P to the contract s.

The cute thing is that P serves as your salt.  Any private key is just an arbitrary random scalar.  Multiplying the private key by the generator results in an arbitrary-seeming point.  That random point is now your salt, which makes this into a genuine bonafide hiding cryptographic commitment!

Now Q is a point, i.e. a public key.  You might be interested in knowing its private key, a scalar.  Suppose you postulate the existence of a scalar q such that:

     Q = q * G

Then you can do the below:

     Q = P + h(P | s) * G
     Q = p * G + h(P | s) * G
     Q = (p + h(P | s)) * G

Then we can conclude that:

     q = p + h(P | s)

Of note is that somebody else cannot learn the private key q unless they already know the private key p.  Knowing the internal public key P is not enough to learn the private key q.  Thus, as long as you are the only one who knows the internal private key p, and you keep it secret, then only you can learn the private key q that can be used to sign with the public key Q (that is also a pay-to-contract commitment).

Now Q is supposed to be a commitment, and once somebody else knows Q, they can challenge you to reveal your committed value, the contract s.  Revealing the pay-to-contract commitment is done by simply giving the internal public key P (which doubles as the salt) and the committed value contract s.

The challenger then simply computes:

    P + h(P | s) * G

And verifies that it matches the Q you gave before.

Some very important properties are:

1.  If you reveal first, then you still remain in sole control of the private key.  This is because revelation only shows the internal public key and the contract, neither of which can be used to learn the internal private key.  So you can reveal and sign in any order you want, without precluding the possibility of performing the other operation in the future.
2.  If you sign with the public key Q first, then you do not need to reveal the internal public key P or the contract s.  You can compute q simply from the internal private key p and the contract s.  You don't even need to pass those in to your signing algorithm, it could just be given the computed q and the message you want to sign!
3.  Anyone verifying your signature using the public key Q is unaware that it is *also* used as a cryptographic commitment.

Another property is going to blow your mind:

1.  You don't have to know the internal private key p in order to create a commitment pay-to-contract public key Q that commits to a contract s you select.

Remember:

    Q = P + h(P | s) * G

The above equation for Q does not require that you know the internal private key p.  All you need to know is the internal public key P.  Since public keys are often revealed publicly, you can use somebody else's public key as the internal public key in a pay-to-contract construction.

Of course, you can't sign for Q (you need to know p to compute the private key q) but this is sometimes an interesting use.

The original proposal for *pay*-to-contract was that a merchant would publish their public key, then a customer would ""order"" by writing the contract s with what they wanted to buy.  Then, the customer would generate the public key Q (committing to s) using the merchant's public key as the internal public key P, then use that in a P2PKH or P2WPKH.  Then the customer would reveal the contract s to the merchant, placing their order, and the merchant would now be able to claim the money.

Another general use for pay-to-contract include publishing a commitment on the blockchain without using an `OP_RETURN` output.  Instead, you just move some of your funds to yourself, using your own public key as the internal public key, then selecting a contract s that commits or indicates what you want to anchor onchain.  This should be the preferred technique rather than `OP_RETURN`.  For example, colored coin implementations over Bitcoin usually used `OP_RETURN`, but the new [RGB colored coin](https://github.com/rgb-org/spec) technique uses pay-to-contract instead, reducing onchain bloat.

### Taproot

Pay-to-contract is also used in the nice new Taproot concept.

Briefly, taproot anchors a Merkle tree of scripts.  The root of this tree is the contract s committed to.  Then, you pay to a SegWit v1 public key, where the public key is the Q pay-to-contract commitment.

When spending a coin paying to a SegWit v1 output with a Taprooted commitment to a set of scripts s, you can do one of two things:

1.  Sign directly with the key.
    If you used Taproot, use the commitment private key q.
2.  Reveal the commitment, then select the script you want to execute in the Merkle tree of scripts (prove the Markle tree path to the script).
    Then satisfy the conditions of the script.

Taproot utilizes the characteristics of pay-to-contract:

1.  If you reveal first, then you still remain in sole control of the private key.
    * This is important if you take the Taproot path and reveal the commitment to the set of scripts s.
      If your transaction gets stalled on the mempool, others can know your commitment details.
      However, revealing the commitment will *not* reveal the internal private key p (which is needed to derive the commitment private key q), so nobody can RBF out your transaction by using the sign-directly path.
2.  If you sign with the public key Q first, then you do not need to reveal the internal public key P or the contract s.
    * This is important for privacy.
      If you are able to sign with the commitment public key, then that automatically hides the fact that you *could* have used an alternate script s instead of the key Q.
3.  Anyone verifying your signature using the public key Q is unaware that it is *also* used as a cryptographic commitment.
    * Again, privacy.  Fullnodes will not know that you had the ability to use an alternate script path.

Taproot is intended to be deployed with the switch to Schnorr-based signatures in SegWit v1.
In particular, Schnorr-based signatures have the following ability that ECDSA cannot do except with much more difficulty:

* It is possible to generate a single public key that cannot be signed, except by the agreement of multiple signers who each contribute part of the public key.
  I.e. this is MuSig, which allows to create an n-of-n signing group that has a single public key.

As public keys can, with Schnorr-based signatures, easily represent an n-of-n signing set, the internal public key P can also actually be a MuSig n-of-n signing set.
This allows for a number of interesting protocols, which have a ""good path"" that will be private if that is taken, but still have fallbacks to ensure proper execution of the protocol and prevent attempts at subverting the protocol.

#### Escrow Under Taproot

Traditionally, escrow is done with a 2-of-3 multisignature script.

However, by use of Taproot and pay-to-contract, it's possible to get more privacy than traditional escrow services.

Suppose we have a buyer, a seller, and an escrow service.
They have keypairs B = b * G, S = s * G, and E = e * G.

The buyer and seller then generate a Taproot output (which the buyer will pay to before the seller sends the product).

The Taproot itself uses an internal public key that is the 2-of-2 MuSig of B and S, i.e. MuSig(B, S).
Then it commits to a pair of possible scripts:

1.  Release to a 2-of-2 MuSig of seller and escrow.
    This path is the ""escrow sides with seller"" path.
2.  Release to a 2-of-2 MuSig of buyer and escrow.
    This path is the ""escrow sides with buyer"" path.

Now of course, the escrow also needs to learn what the transaction was supposed to be about.
So what we do is that the escrow key is actually used as the internal public key of *another* pay-to-contract, this time with the script s containing the details of the transaction.
For example, if the buyer wants to buy some USD, the contract could be ""Purchase of 50 pieces of United States Federal Reserve Green Historical Commemoration papers for 0.357 satoshis"".

This takes advantage of the fact that the committer need not know the private key behind the public key being used in a pay-to-contract commitment.
The actual transaction it is being used for is committed to onchain, because the public key published on the blockchain ultimately commits (via a taproot to a merkle tree to a script containing a MuSig of a public key modified with the committed contract) to the contract between the buyer and seller.

Thus, the cases are:

1.  Buyer and seller are satisfied, and cooperatively create a signature that spends the output to the seller.
    * The escrow service *never learns it could have been an escrow*.
      The details of their transaction remain hidden and private, so the buyer is never embarrassed over being so tacky as to waste their hard money buying USD.
2.  The buyer and seller disagree (the buyer denies having received the goods in proper quality).
    * They contact the escrow, and reveal the existence of the onchain contract, and provide the data needed to validate just what, exactly, the transaction was supposed to be about.
      This includes revealing the ""Purchase of 50 pieces of United States Federal Reserve Green Historical Commemoration papers for 0.357 satoshis"", as well as all the data needed to validate up to that level.
      The escrow then investigates the situation and then decides in favor of one or the other.
      It signs whatever transaction it decides (either giving it to the seller or buyer), and possibly also extracts an escrow fee.

#### Smart Contracts Unchained

Developed by /u/ZmnSCPxj here: https://zmnscpxj.github.io/bitcoin/unchained.html

A logical extension of the above escrow case is to realize that the ""contract"" being given to the escrow service is simply some text that is interpreted by the escrow, and which is then executed by the escrow to determine where the funds should go.

Now, the *language* given in the previous escrow example is English.
But nothing prevents the contract from being written in another language, including a machine-interpretable one.

Smart Contracts Unchained simply makes the escrow service an interpreter for some Smart Contract scripting language.

The cute thing is that there still remains an ""everything good"" path where the participants in the smart contract all agree on what the result is.
In that case, with Taproot, *there is no need to publish the smart contract* --- only the participants know, and nobody else has to.
This is an improvement in not only privacy, but also blockchain size --- the smart contract itself never has to be published onchain, only the commitment to it is (and that is embedded in a public key, which is necessary for basic security on the blockchain anyway!).

## Sign-to-contract

Hiding commitments in signatures!

Sign-to-contract is something like the dual or inverse of pay-to-contract.
Instead of hiding a commitment in the public key, it is hidden in the signature.

Sign-to-contract utilizes the fact that signatures need to have a random scalar r which is then published as the point R = r * G.

Similarly to pay-to-contract, we can have an internal random scalar p and internal point P that is used to compute R:

    R = P + h(P | s) * G

The corresponding random scalar r is:

    r = p + h(P | s)

The signing algorithm then uses the modified scalar r.

This is in fact just the same method of commitment as in pay-to-contract.
The operations of committing and revealing are the same.
The only difference is *where* the commitment is stored.

Importantly, however, is that you *cannot* take somebody else's signature and then create an alternate signature that commits to some s you select.
This is in contrast with pay-to-contract, where you can take somebody else's public key and then create an alternate public key that commits to some s you select.

Sign-to-contract is somewhat newer as a concept than pay-to-contract.
It seems there are not as many applications of pay-to-contract yet.

### Uses

Sign-to-contract can be used, like pay-to-contract, to publish commitments onchain.

The difference is below:

1.  Signatures are attached to transaction inputs.
2.  Public keys are attached to transaction outputs.

One possible use is in a competitor to Open Timestamps.
Open Timestamps currently uses `OP_RETURN` to commit to a Merkle Tree root of commitments aggregated by an Open Timestamps server.

Instead of using such an `OP_RETURN`, individual wallets can publish a timestamped commitment by making a self-paying transaction, embedding the commitment inside the signature for that transaction.
Such a feature can be added to any individual wallet software.
https://blog.eternitywall.com/2018/04/13/sign-to-contract/

This does not require any additional infrastructure (i.e. no aggregating servers like in Open Timestamps).

### R Reuse Concerns

ECDSA and Schnorr-based signature schemes are vulnerable to something called ""R reuse"".

Basically, if the same R is used for different messages (transactions) with the same public key, a third party with both signatures can compute the private key.

This is concerning especially if the signing algorithm is executed in an environment with insufficient entropy.
By complete accident, the environment might yield the same random scalar r in two different runs.
Combined with address reuse (which implies public key reuse) this can leak the private key inadvertently.

For example, most hardware wallets will not have any kind of entropy at all.

The usual solution to this is, instead of selecting an arbitrary random r (which might be impossible in limited environments with no available entropy), is to hash the message and use the hash as the r.

This ensures that if the same public key is used again for a different message, then the random r is also different, preventing reuse at all.

Of course, if you are using sign-to-contract, then you can't use the above ""best practice"".

It seems to me plausible that computing the internal random scalar p using the hash of the message (transaction) should work, then add the commitment on top of that.
However, I'm not an actual cryptographer, I just play one on Reddit.
Maybe /u/apoelstra or /u/pwuille can explain in more detail.

4. Currency diversification - Locking your personal wealth to one currency is risky. Even small deviations can have a significant negative impact - especially over a longer stretch of time. Use a foreign bank account to diversify your currencies and spread risk more efficiently.
5. Maximize your freedom - The more dependent you are on your local bank, the less freedom you have. If one institution can effectively prohibit you from accessing your money then you should think about opening a bank account abroad. This will help to broaden your choices and maximize your freedom.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

I enjoy games with a lot of boss fights and boy this game has a solid variety of bosses and mini-bosses. They made Sebastian much more badass this time around so it feels really satisfying defeating bosses esp on hard mode. Second cool thing is that there are like 4 different villains in this game all of which have their own level structure and style. For example, when you're up against Theodore all these fire type enemies start appearing and the environment is usually engulfed in flames, etc. Plus you have the semi-open world style which gives you a lot of options.

Also, story is way better than I was expecting and game visuals like character models and cutscenes are well done. The music score is really solid also. Just a great game overall. I honestly don't get why its so underrated. Shouldn't this be one of the more popular games? :/",technology
personalfinance,I'm a Freelancer and worried about estimated taxes,"Long time reader, first time poster. I apologize in advance for the long post.

&amp;#x200B;

I became a freelancer in 2017. Prior to that, I always had W-2s and used software to file our taxes. My husband has always had and still does have W-2s. We file jointly. I had an accountant prepare our taxes since becoming a freelancer. He would calculate the estimated quarterly taxes for the next year based upon the previous year's income of both of us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the accountant's calculations of 2017, he said that I was not slated to make enough to pay federal quarterly taxes in 2018. So, I only paid state quarterly estimated taxes. I had a decent year freelancing in 2018 and I reached out to the accountant a few times to ask about adjustments to the quarterly taxes and he estimated that I didn't have to worry about it. So, when it was time to pay 2018 taxes in April, we had a shock when we owed a few thousand dollars. Needless to say, I made a bad choice with that accountant.

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: My accountant recently went to jail for reasons unrelated to accounting and that's why I am here.

&amp;#x200B;

So, for 2019, he calculated the estimated quarterly taxes based on our 2018 income. I have been paying those payments on time all year. For Q4 of this year, I am going to have more income come in and when the time comes, I am not sure if I should pay more than what was calculated or just take the hit next April. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I should pay more estimated when Q4 is due, what is the best way to calculate that? 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I would like to be as accurate as possible with estimated quarterly taxes. I'm just unsure how to correctly calculate it.

&amp;#x200B;

A few other questions:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is it normal to calculate estimated taxes of income of both my husband and I even though he is already paying taxes through his paychecks? Why wouldn't the estimated quarterly taxes only be based solely upon my freelance income? Is it because we file jointly?

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have been putting aside 18% of my income for taxes. I have an Excel spreadsheet that I use to track income every time I receive it and once a month I set aside that amount. Is there a better method to calculate what I need to set aside for taxes?

I make 34K and he makes 90K in engineering, our total gross income coming to 124K. I am currently looking for a higher paying position in my field, while he is getting his M.S. in EE. His income is likely to increase in the next few years, although I'm unsure by how much. We aren't relying on that by any means. Credit scores are about 750. 


We were married in May 2018, moved across country and then my SO began his job August 2018. Since then we have paid down about 45k of higher interest (&gt;6%) student loans, car loan (4.5%) and paying back our parents (0%). We are now contributing ~15% income to retirement accounts. 

Assets:

HYSA: 10k (1.9%)

357: 6k (6%)

Pension: Just opened (3%)

Roth IRA: 1k (7%)

401K: 6k (7%)

Debt: 28k in deferred federal student loans (&lt;4%). Minimum payment is $179.  

Goals to be accomplished in 5 years or less: 

1. Increase emergency fund to 15k

2. Buy a house 350k, with 15-20% down

3. Replace husbands '03 Civic for a used car in cash (~20k)

4. Have our first child 

5. Pay down remaining low interest student loan


After bills, taxes, entertainment and 15% retirement contributions we are able to allocate ~3-4k/mo to a house down payment, debt, and car savings. 

My plan of attack is after bumping up our emergency fund to 15k, we put 3k/mo into our HYSA for our house down payment fund. The remaining 500-1k/mo will go to decreasing our federal student loan. We hold on to my husband's car for as long as it will run or until our first child arrives as I don't feel comfortable having our baby in the car. 

With that said, here is our timeline: 

2021/2022 350k house, w/ ~300k mortgage after down payment and closing costs

2023- Replace car

2023- Baby -&gt; open 529 account

2024- Remaining low interest student loan paid off

personalfinance,New debt months before a potential mortgage impact on credit?,"A recent expense came up right as I started planing for purchasing my first home here at the beginning of the year... (I’m not the best at timing I guess haha...

Options- 
1) apply for a personal loan, relatively low interest rate, would be paid off before too long (12-24 months)
2) drain my savings leaving just a few thousand in savings

Leaning towards the loan but I’m worried how it would impact my credit to take out the new debt. I don’t know how new debt would impact the score. I have good credit (last pulled in 2017 with Experian, 780 at the time. Only positive reporting since then. I did pay off a student loan recently and my score dipped a bit as a result, now at 784 if you can trust credit karma.

What’s reporting - three credit cards paid off every month, 3 student loans cumulative balance under 5k. New loan would be about 5k. Not worried about DTI as I don’t plan on over extending on the new home. Just worried how doubling my installment debt shortly before a mortgage would hurt my score and subsequently the rate on a mortgage. Oldest line, credit card opened in 2012. Newest line, credit card opened on 2017.

personalfinance,How much is too much for mortgage? [NL],"Hi all,

I often see people saying 3x your income for a mortgage is too much. I live in the Netherlands and with housing prices this seems to be quite tricky. Median house price in entire country is €300k but within my area it is difficult to get any house for less than that.

I currently make €58k + €10k OT (not guaranteed) and my partner makes €38k. Without OT we are looking at just under €100k combined which puts any house basically out of range according to reddit. 

Currently our total monthly expenses are around €2500 leaving around ~€3300 in monthly savings. We are 26/27 years old and want children around 30/31 so expect expenses to rise in a few years. We have no debts, ~€50k in investments and €20k in savings.

personalfinance,Student Loan Discharge for Brother in Law,"Hi all, 

My BIL (Brother in Law) recently passed away unexpectedly a month and a half ago and we are trying to take care of the finances. He worked mostly part time and had a lot of debt from debt collectors, IRS, and student loans. My wife is helping her parents with some of these financial concerns as her parents are unfamiliar with this stuff. 

I know that you should never admit to the debt, since it can possibly transfer over to you -  - but we are wondering how to get them discharged? 

My wife called Fedloan, and the representative told her to state that her brother had passed, and they want the loans discharged. I asked her to hold off on sending that letter, as I want to make sure it won't transfer the debt in someway? 

Will a letter like this with the death certificate keep us safe from the debt transferring? Or is there another route we should go?

No debt outside of 1st mortgage.

personalfinance,Advice on getting a car after Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.,"I filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy at the beginning of August, and just had my 341 meeting three days ago. My understanding is that the debt will be discharged and the case closed in 30-60 days.

With all this behind me for the most part, I am trying to figure out how to approach getting a new car. 

I am surrendering my car because the loan was so underwater - still need to contact my lender to arrange the pickup. 

I have received a ton of those mailers from local companies and dealerships offering assistance for people like myself. 

I am aware the interest rates are astronomical at first, but I really don't have many options. I calculated the cost of taking Uber to work and it would be about the same as a car payment + insurance each month.

A lot of these places are stating they approve people for up to $20k. However, I don't want to put myself in a situation where I am spread thin financially due to a high car payment. I'd rather put that extra income away in an emergency fund/savings.

Is it possible to get financing for used cars that are in the $4k-$8k range? 

Does it have to be through a dealership? Or will lenders work with me if I buy from a private party?

Unfortunately I do not have any money to put down. The money I do have will need to go towards insurance, registration, and my first payment.

Lastly, can I purchase a car and get approved for a loan now? Or do I have to wait the 30-60 days until everything is discharged? I've been getting conflicted information on this. Some say you can do it before the 341 meeting, others say after, and some say you have to wait until everything is closed. 

I really need to get a car ASAP as my rear brakes are completely shot and my registration expires next month. I obviously don't want to sink any more money into a car I'll be getting rid of so soon.",finance

personalfinance,Opened a transfer balance credit card and Credit Wise reported my score dropping by 30 points!,"I owed around $3000 on a credit card after unexpected car repairs and was having trouble getting the balance down due to 26% interest rate. I opened a new credit card from Chase with a 0% transfer balance interest rate for 15 months back in July. I made the transfer from one credit account to the other immediately and I now have an alert from Capital One Credit Wise that my debt went from $3000 to $6000 and this caused my credit score to drop 30 points from 750 to 720 and 10% credit utilization to 20%. I expected to lose a few points due to a new hard inquiry, but 30 points is huge and I have not incurred new debt, just transferred it. 

Is Credit Wise really an accurate account of my credit score? If so, can I dispute the amount of debt I have since I only did a transfer? I worked hard to get my credit score back up after I had some money issues about 7 years ago, so this is concerning me.",finance

Use case is long term cash reserves.  I don't plan to use which ever bank this is at for other services like loans or checking or ATM.  Few times I might want to pull some out I'd be fine with a 3 day ACH like Ally has, but I've heard other can be worse which I really don't want.

personalfinance,How Should I Proceed with this Early Warning System Dispute,"Good afternoon, everyone. I'm in central NY and in a bit of a headache-inducing situation.

When I was younger, my mother opened a lot of accounts in my name, most of which I was unaware of, but some that I was. In one instance, for example, she asked if she could open a small card in my name to purchase a Father's Day present that she would pay off in that month and, being like 18, in college, and not paying any of my own bills, I said that was fine. What I was not aware of was that she was maxing out these cards and kitting checks.

Shortly after I graduated, I received a notification from PayPal that there were a small series of checks being sent to me to be deposited in my account that I needed to approve. I called my mom and she said it was for her dog business and that I needed to approve them, so I did, and a little while later my entire bank account (we'll call them Bank A) was drained and I was overdrafted $2300. That was when I discovered she had been kitting checks for a long time using my account as one of them, and that she'd bounced several checked to my account and withdrawn the funds those checks promised.

I didn't want to send my mother to jail, so I didn't get a police report at the time -- I'm still not certain if you can get a police report and be sure that the person won't be prosecuted, nor am I certain whether it's too late to do so even if it were possible. I got a job working security and worked 70+ hour weeks to pay it all off within a month. When I sent the last of the money in, I called Bank A to discuss how to proceed, and was told that they were closing my account due to their policy, but that the balance would be covered. I was sad, becaused I liked Bank A, but I figured that maybe they would reconsider in a while, so I went and opened an account with MtB to use in the meantime.

Three years later, I've been a substitute teacher, finished my certification, finished grad school, and I moved in with my fiancee in an apartment. I've taken all the cards from my mother, changed the passwords, contact info, removed her as authorized users, and reported the cards as lost/stolen to get new numbers for each of them. She no longer has access to any of them, nor has there been any suspicious activity on them (except for after a Capital One breach recently, but that wasn't her!). I have been making the payments on each of them, and paying them down as quickly as I can. There were no missed or late payments on my credit report, so my score is recovering at reached 700 recently.

I went to open a joint banking account with my fiancee and was told that I was flagged with the ""Early Warning System"" and so I could not open a bank account or be added to one. I got my report and called the EWS to find out more, and followed up with Bank A. It turns out that I was reported for that incident and that 0.59 cents were left overdrafted from the account:

~~~

Paid/UnPaid/Settled: Unpaid

Contribution Reason: Checking Account Fraud

~~~

I paid the 0.59, for which I don't know why I never received anything in the mail, and, after a month of calling up and down the Bank A chain (they have a permanent [unless I get a police report] code in their system flagging me as a security risk that they are never allowed to do business with, so the system kept stopping the letters from going out until I got someone to override it), got them to send me a letter stating the following:

""Reference: Requested Standing of Your Bank A Account

Dear XXX, thank you for the full recovery of your charge off account.

We're writing to confirm the standing of the following account with Bank A as of August 21, 2019:

Current balance: $0.00

Date opened: xxx

If you have any questions, please call us at PHONE NUMBER, our mobile shortcut ##### or PHONE NUMBER. We appreciate the opportunity to serve all your financial needs.

Thank you,

Bank A""

I am trying to parse how I can best resolve this issue and what, exactly, I should say in my dispute. Bank A has recouped their loss, so they might not even respond, but I can't know that for sure. I know that Chexsystems deletes negative reports after 5 years and, on the phone with EWS, they told me that they also delete their negative reports after 5 years, but that would be September of 2021, which is a long time to wait. I'm also not sure what else this will affect. Would a bank check it before issuing a mortgage or car loan? Would it mean I have to pay a higher interest rate on a mortgage or car loan as some sort of security risk? I'm reluctant to wait it out and see. What should I be trying to say in the dispute letter I send to the EWS given the details of this situation?

Thank you so much for any advice you can offer on how to resolve this situation!",finance

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 16th, 2019","Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 16th, 2019.

# **Week ahead: The stock market is poised to set a new record if the Federal Reserve delivers  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/13/week-ahead-the-stock-market-is-poised-to-set-a-new-record-if-the-federal-reserve-delivers.html)**
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday, but what it says about its future plans will determine whether stocks continue their run at record highs.
*****
&gt; Tensions around this month’s rates meeting decision are high. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell faces dissent from within the Fed board from some members who don’t believe the economy is weak enough to warrant cutting rates. Two members opposed the last rate cut, and even more could oppose this one.
*****
&gt; The Fed is also under pressure from financial markets that threw a tantrum earlier this summer on concern the Fed was moving too slowly to stave off a recession. On top of that, the Fed faces an unprecedented level of criticism from the White House, with President Donald Trump repeatedly criticizing the Fed board and Powell, himself, for not cutting interest rates fast enough. This week, the president went so far as to call Fed officials “boneheads” and demanded they take the fed funds rate to zero or even a negative level.
*****
&gt; Against this backdrop, the stock market is flirting with new highs, as the Fed joins other central banks to ease policy, in the face of a global economic slowdown. Stocks were higher for the week and on Friday trading less than one percent below July’s all-time highs in the Dow and S&amp;P 500. The Dow ended the week 1.6% higher at 27,219, while the S&amp;P 500 was up just about 1% at 3,007, 21 points away from its all-time high.
*****
&gt; The market was boosted by signs there could be progress in trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, as each side held off on some new tariffs, ahead of formal talks in October.
*****
&gt; “It’s been good news all around for the markets this week. You have thawing of trade tensions. You have more central bank easing, and you have Goldilocks economic data. Investors are thrilled...and that’s why you have markets just fractionally below all-time highs,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; Riding on the Fed
&gt; The Fed stands to disappoint markets if it does not explicitly promise more easing. The Fed could do that in the quarterly projection of interest rate forecasts, which will be issued with its economic projections after the meeting. Fed officials include forecasts for growth and inflation, besides interest rates, which appear in a chart known as the “dot plot.”.
*****
&gt; “The question is will the Fed signal a willingness to keep going with rate cuts, or will they suggest this mid-cycle adjustment is nearing its end. My view is they’re not going to back themselves into a corner, and they’re going to give themselves plenty of room to cut again at some point,” Arone said. “That’s going to be the biggest risk right now. The markets are pricing in a number of rate cuts in the next few quarters and will the Fed deliver on that...That will be a friction point.”
*****
&gt; U.S. data in the past week has been largely better-than-expected, with August’s retail sales up 0.4%, continuing a stronger trend, on the back of improved auto sales. The dilemma for the Fed, however, could be the fact that both producer and consumer level inflation picked up in August, with core CPI reaching 2.4%, its highest year over year growth pace since 2008. That is well above the Fed’s 2% target, but the Fed prefers to watch PCE inflation, which is running at about 1.6%.
*****
&gt; On the calendar in the coming week is Empire State manufacturing Monday; industrial production Tuesday; housing starts Wednesday, and existing home sales and the Philadelphia Fed survey Thursday. But it’s the Fed that will resonate more with markets.
*****
&gt; “We they think they’ll cut 25 [basis points]. We think it will be a pretty even split between half the committee looking for one more cut and the rest looking for no action,” said Kevin Cummins, senior economist at NatWest Markets. The Fed shaved the fed funds target rate range by a quarter point, to 2.00 to 2.25% in July.
*****
&gt; Some strategists haves said the more dissents, the more it would add to increased market volatility, since the Fed outlook becomes much more uncertain if Fed officials are not more uniformly supporting policy actions.
*****
&gt; Cummins said he expects the Fed’s post-meeting statement to reflect slightly softer economic activity in July, and it will likely mentioning that the labor market may be just “solid,” instead of “strong” and that job gains have moderated.
*****
&gt; “That leaves the door open for more [rate cuts]. The dot plot shows another cut by the end of the year. You could make the case they’ll pause in October if things remain the same,” he said, adding they could also resume in December.
*****
&gt; Calmer markets
&gt; The Fed faces much calmer markets than it would have in August, when trade tensions increased with Trump’s tweet threatening more tariffs on China. Stocks have been rising as bond yields come off August lows, and traders are now pricing in a 25 basis point cut this week and one more for this year and another next year.
*****
&gt; As Treasury yields fell to record and multi-year lows in August, the futures market had priced as many as three more Fed rate cuts fort his year. Since then the 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, has rebounded to 1.90%— more than 45 basis points off its low.
*****
&gt; The more than 30 basis points move in the 10-year yield in the past week, was the largest weekly move since November, 2016.
*****
&gt; Trade developments could also move markets in the coming week, just as they have in the past week. Analyst say the market is most vulnerable if there’s a negative surprise. Trump’s tweet on trade Aug. 1, threatening more tariffs on China, created a new round of turbulence in markets.
*****
&gt; “It’s kind of ironic. Without the U.S. China trade conflict, the Fed wouldn’t be cutting rates at all, and yet President Trump continues to bash them to cut rates,” Arone said.
*****
&gt; Arone said the bigger overriding driver for the market is in fact the trade negotiations, and he said the markets may be too optimistic in expectations for a trade deal.
*****
&gt; “There’s an inherent kind of risk to the markets if in fact, tensions escalate again,” he said.

# Long-Term Treasury ETF (TLT) Has 2nd Biggest Weekly Drop Ever

&gt; Outside of equities, we saw a massive move higher in Treasury yields this week and a massive drop in Treasury bond prices. For the 20+ year Treasury ETF (TLT), this week's 6.34% drop was its second worst week on record since it began trading back in 2002.

&gt; Below is a look at TLT's historical weekly percentage change, and we also show how TLT has performed in the weeks and months following one-week drops of more than 5% like we saw this week. As shown in the table, TLT has normally continued lower for a while following big down weeks.

# S&amp;P 500 Nearing ATHs But Individual Sectors Not So Much

&gt; The past week has been a solid run for the US equity market as a whole. The S&amp;P 500 continues to edge ever closer to prior all-time highs; opening today within half a percent of this level. As shown in the chart below, on average across all sectors, though, it is a little bit less optimistic. The average sector is still 6.5% below record highs. Excluding energy, which is by far the furthest (in terms of price and time) from its all-time high, the average across sectors jumps up to 3.6%. Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only sectors within 1% of their highs while the Tech sector is not far behind only 1.5% away.

# Betting Markets and the Election

&gt; One way to keep track of the evolving Presidential primaries and general election news is the website electionbettingodds.com which shows what the betting market is predicting for upcoming election outcomes. In the charts below, we show the current probabilities of a primary and general election win for each of the various candidates (officially announced and otherwise) with a 1% or higher chance of winning. Elizabeth Warren now has a commanding lead in the Democrats' primary with a 34.9% chance of victory with Biden and Sanders in second and third.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091319-Election1u.png))**

&gt; Where things get more interesting is to figure out which candidates have the best chance of winning the general election assuming they win their primary. For example, President Trump's odds of winning his primary are 88.1%, but his odds of winning the general election for the Presidency are priced at 43.7%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091319-Election2u.png))**

&gt; By dividing that 43.7% by the 88.1% chance of primary victory we can get to a 49.6% general election pricing assuming the candidate wins their primary. This conditional probability probably shouldn't be taken too seriously, but it's got some interesting results. Among candidates polling over 5%, Beto O'Rourke has the highest odds (80%) of a general election win if he takes the primary while other Democratic hopefuls Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders are priced at 60%+ odds. Biden's general election odds are at 55% if he wins the primary, while Warren -- the current front runner -- is at 49.9%. Notably, although Trump is close at 49.6%, no Republican has a conditional priced probability over 50% to win the general.

&gt; All of that said, these conditional relationships can be very unstable and are complicated to arbitrage, so we probably shouldn't place too much faith in the detail of their message, but it's still interesting to see that markets are implicitly optimistic about the electability of a candidate like Sanders or Yang relative to more mainstream candidates like Warren, Harris, or Biden.

# Copper Unconsolidated

&gt; In last night's Closer, we noted the recent price action of copper. Over the past several months, copper had been consistently moving lower in a solid downtrend, but that downtrend has been broken this week. Finishing up about 1% in yesterday's session, copper had its first close above resistance which would suggest a further move higher. We're seeing additional gains today as the commodity continues to break out. Over the next few weeks, copper bulls will look for a series of higher highs and higher lows that would eventually form a new uptrend.

The fact that there are more than 20 stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that are up over 20% already this week is notable in itself. Even crazier, though, is that when you look at the share prices of these stocks, all but seven have current share prices of less than $5 per share even after their gains this week, and the average share price of the 20 stocks listed is just $7.42. Also, as we noted in an earlier post, it's not as if there are tons of stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 trading below $5 per share. Heading into today, there were only 55 and 54 of them were up on the week.

&gt; Turning to the list of losers so far this week, while there are more than 20 stocks that are up over 20%, not a single stock in the index is down 20% and only eight are down more than 10%. Besides the fact that the stocks listed below are down so far this week and the ones above are up, the other major and pretty consistent difference between the two lists is their share prices. As of today, the average price of the 20 biggest losers so far this week is $135.74 which is more than 18 times the average share price of the biggest week to date winners.

# Throw It All Out the Window

&gt; It's time to throw all those financial ""mumbo jumbo"" ratios out the window. That's right. You can take your P/E, P/B, P/S ratios and send them out packing with EV/EBITDA and the PEG ratio. While you're at it, why don't you free up some space and toss out all those finance textbooks you bought in college and grad school. None of it matters. At least not this week where making money in the market has been as simple as ""buy low and sell high.""

&gt; Through yesterday's close, the S&amp;P 1500, which is comprised of large-caps (S&amp;P 500), mid-caps (S&amp;P 400), and small-caps (S&amp;P 600), was up just under 1% on the week. The average week to date performance of individual stocks in the index, however, was a much more impressive gain of 5%. By far the biggest gains have come from the stocks with the lowest share prices. Coming into the week, there were 55 stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that had share prices of less than $5, and through Wednesday's close, they were up an average of 21% with 54 of 55 in the black. 21%!!!! Coming into today, there were also seven stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that were already up over 40% this week, and guess what? They all came into the week with share prices below $5.

&gt; Looking at the performance of individual stocks this week shows that share prices appear to have been a key driver of performance. In the chart below, we grouped stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 based on their share prices as of last Friday and then calculated the average performance of the stocks in each group so far this week (through Wednesday's close). While stocks with share prices of less than $5 per share were up an average of 20.8%, the performance of stocks priced between $5 and $10 per share were up a still impressive 10.9%. What's even crazier about this chart is the fact that as you move out to the right (higher share prices), average performance consistently weakens to the point where stocks with high share prices ($100+) have only gained an average of 0.1% so far this week. Who needs Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMAZN) and Chipotle (CMG) when you could have had JC Penney (JCP), Dean Foods (DF), or Mallinckrodt (MNK). If these high priced stocks know what's good for them, they better start announcing 10-1 splits pronto! (That was a joke.)

&gt; In all seriousness, the performance numbers listed below further illustrate this week's massive rotation out of momentum strategies, where stocks and sectors that had been leading have been sold off while those that had lagged or been written off for dead have seen some buying interest or at least an easing of selling pressure. All the textbooks and financial ratios in the world may provide comfort to analysts and investors, but they don't help at all when the momentum tide turns.

# Small Cap Surge

&gt; Small caps have been serial underperformers versus the large-cap S&amp;P 500 over the last 12+ months, but they're having their day in the sun this week. Not only has the small-cap Russell 2,000 risen more than 1% for three consecutive trading days to start the week, but the index has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than one percentage point on each of the last three days.

&gt; If this is the start of a longer-term small cap resurgence, there is certainly a lot of runway left. Below is a chart of the ratio between the S&amp;P 500 and the Russell 2,000 over the last 15 years. When the line is rising, the S&amp;P is outperforming the Russell. When the line is falling, the Russell is outperforming the S&amp;P.

&gt; As you can see in the chart, the S&amp;P has been outperforming the Russell for the last year, and the ratio got extended to the very top of its 15-year range at the start of September. Since peaking earlier this month, however, the ratio has fallen dramatically as small caps have started to outperform. Even after the recent small-cap outperformance, the ratio remains well above its long-term average.

# Time For Gold To Shine?

&gt; “The higher the base, the higher in space,” is an old technical analysis saying.

&gt; Gold is up 18% year-to-date (as of 9/10/2019), poised for its best year since 2010, when it gained 30%. We see many reasons why this rally may have legs.

&gt; Last year’s action was rare: The S&amp;P 500 Index, 10-year U.S. Treasuries, and gold were all lower. Going back to 1971, when gold was officially removed from the gold standard, last year was the first year that all three assets were lower in a calendar year. Now in 2019, all three assets are up significantly, quite a difference from last year!

&gt; Gold and stocks have trended the same way: Since 1980, stocks and gold both have risen in 19 of those 39 years, and both have fallen in only four years. Somewhat surprisingly, both were up more than 10% in eight of those years. Gold might be viewed as “defensive,” but history shows there can be times when both gold and stocks have had nice gains together.

&gt; “Gold is breaking out to new highs after doing nothing for years,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Concerns over the global slowdown, $17 trillion in negative yielding debt, inverted yield curves, and central banks stepping up their gold purchases have all pushed the yellow metal out of a picture-perfect base.”

&gt; Technicals support a rally: As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold completed a nice-looking six-year saucer bottom and broke out above previous resistance. As the quote at the start of the blog noted, when things base for years, the potential move can be quite explosive.

&gt; A well-deserved pullback may present an opportunity for suitable investors to add exposure in appropriate strategies.

# S&amp;P 500 up 13 of last 16 September option expiration weeks

&gt; September’s option expiration week is up 62.2% of the time for S&amp;P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 56.8% of the time and 59.5% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last sixteen years, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September’s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&amp;P 500 has been down six of the last seven since.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,"Investment options for ~€200,000 bank loan","Hello everyone,

I brought an apartment a few years ago, and now I have an opportunity to get an 200k EUR extension on the mortgage for \~2% interest. It will bump up the monthly payment from 900 to around 1800 in the next 15 years, which is still within what I can afford with my current salary.

Now the question is what should I invest in with the money, I have a few ideas in mind:

1/ Buy another apartment and rent it out The return in my area considering the overheads is around 6%, I should be able to handle the landlord duty with my SO. My main concern is locking too much money in local real estate, since I am planning to move in 2 years.

2/ Buy index fund

I already have around 150k invested in a few vangard ETF, mostly a 3 way split between SPX500, DEV Europe, WORLD HIGH DIV. I can take the money and add it to those fund slowly in 1-2 years

personalfinance,Should I dump 2/3rds of my savings on student loans?,"I graduated college in 2012 with $26k in student loans. 7 years later, I still owe $14,644 with an interest rate at 4.875%.  I recently increased my monthly payment from the minimum of $120 a month to $300 a month - I'll have my loan paid off in April 2024 and my servicer will have gotten more than $1,700 in interest from me.

To be honest, I'm sick of looking at this debt. I have $9,100 in my savings account which gives me 1.88% APY. Doing the math, it makes more sense to dump much of my savings onto the loan as it'd save me more money that what I'm making with the savings account. 

What I'm thinking about doing is dumping $6,100 from my savings onto the loan, which brings the loan balance down to about $8,544. I'll have $3,000 left in my savings as an emergency fund. I'll then increase my monthly payment to $900 a month which will get my loan paid off around July 2020 (this also leaves my with just over $100 a month extra after all my expenses like food, rent, car insurance, etc). My servicer will only get about $200 in interest from me by then.

After the loan is paid off, assuming I don't get a raise between now and then, I'll have my student loan completely paid off which means I'll have $1,000 extra per month toward whatever I want - but I can easily get my savings built back up to what it was after months

I've also considered other places to put my money that would earn me more, but I haven't come across anything with low risk and would yield greater than 4.875%. 

There's definitely an emotional element to this - letting go of $6,100 is tough. Maybe I'm seeking emotional support from r/personalfinance but I'm also looking for a sanity check. After typing all this out, I feel like I know what I need to do - but I'd love some thoughts on this plan.

personalfinance,Financial engineering to reduce student loan interest,"I'm trying to do some fancy financial maneuvers here and am wondering if I'm missing anything. 

So, I'm in the process of refinancing my loans, which is great, but I want to get these loans off my plate. So I was browsing nerd wallet and their ratings of rewards credit cards which gave me an idea. One card, for example, has a 3% cash back program in addition to a 15-month no APR period. What if, I paid for a few small chunks, say 5k, of the debt at a time. Got the 3% cash back($150 in my pocket), made some payments on the main loans, then paid off the card before the interest would kick in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, I'd be paying no interest on fractions of the loan, and getting the cash back reward with should significantly reduce the overall/average interest rate that I'd be paying throughout the lifetime of the loan.

My salary alone is 68k/yr

&amp;#x200B;

After taxes, benefits for the family and a 5% 401K contribution my take home income is $1589 paid every 2 weeks.  This equates to $3178 per month (with a third payment happening twice per year).  I just started at this new job too so I probably can't expect a promotion or pay increase anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

This leaves $358 for living expenses (food, gas, baby stuff, house/car repairs and maint., etc.)  It's simply not enough.  I've been taking from my savings every month since he's been born and money is running out fast.  The credit card debt and Honda payment makes me think it can be consolidated, but i know absolutely nothing about debt consolidation and I am very afraid of being ripped off.  The Honda is in my wife's name and she got that loan an a high interest rate because she had no established credit at the time, but that was 4 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I need high speed internet at my house for work so I'm not sure I can cancel that.  I guess the easiest thing to do is to sell the Honda since we don't really need it and the payment is high.  But I would still need more help beyond that to loosen the grip.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone give me any advice?  Is debt consolidation the right way to go? If so, how to I differentiate between a good deal and a bad deal?  Are there any other obvious ways to get this number under control?

I’ve got about 500 additional dollars to spare / month which would equal the 6k that you are allowed to contribute to a Roth in 2019.

If I contribute the additional amount to student loan, that would increase my monthly payment to 2600 which would mean that I could refinance and pay over a 10 year period (right now at 15) dropping my interest rate to around 4.7%.

personalfinance,High Student Loan Payment Help,"I am graduating school this December with about $81,000 in student loan debt ($50k private, $30k US federal). My weighted average interest rate is 7.9%. According to the federal student aid counseling calculator my monthly payment will be about $1,000.

Fortunately, I have a job in my field of study starting January. My salary is $44,000/year after-taxes. I am currently living with my parents paying $100/month rent. I have a car with no loan, but it's 10+ years old with over 200k miles. I will be doing a lot of driving for my new job so I'll need a new car soon.

My parents couldn't help pay for any of my school or living expenses. I have been working all throughout college, but only have $3,000 saved due to high living expenses- mainly insane college town rent and insurance. Because of some issues with my car and other un-budgeted expenses over the last 4 years, I have $5k in credit card debt at 19% APR.

I feel buried in debt. My parents have mentioned they will want me to pay more rent come January, but they will be understanding if I need to pay less to pay-off loans. My hours will be 50+ per week, so there's not really room for a part-time job.

My federal payments don't start until June, which makes my monthly payment about $700/month. I currently plan on paying $1,750/month towards the credit card debt until it's paid-off. After gas and bare minimums I plan on saving as much as possible.

Does anyone have any other budgeting advice? Or any experience with student loan refinancing/consolidation? I'm not sure if I can get a better interest rate, my credit score is 750. Soon I'll have to apply for a car loan as well. My parents cannot help with the payments and I'd never ask them to.

personalfinance,I need help creating a budget i can stick with,"Heres my situation: Ive had trouble holding jobs in the past for more than a few months at a time. I finally found a job that I feel I can stick with long term. Basically, I've been there since May and havent saved anything. Im justifying it in my mind because I went so long without a job that there are a lot of things I went without, so that's where most of my money has gone. Along with car repairs, rent, and food.

So, with that being said, here is my income and monthly expenses. My goal is to save six months rent to get my own apartment, and to save up for a newer vehicle so I can spend less on maintenance (currently driving a 28 year old car.) Possibly an emergency fund as well.

I make $13 an hour, and work 120 hours every 2 weeks usually. Accounting for overtime pay, my checks are about $1500, twice a month. When we are fully staffed, I work 40 hours a week. This has only happened one pay period since I started. An 80 hour pay period, I make about 900 per check. I want to take into account the possibility of smaller checks when getting an apartment. I know that I should only spend 30% on rent, so that may be difficult when taking into account the smaller pay checks.

My expenses are as follows: 

Rent (and dinner, included in rent cost) $300

Phone $45

Gas $75

Car Insurance $75

Studio time $150 twice a month (this is temporary, only 2 sessions left)

Food $200 

Vaping ~$40

Netflix $10

Xbox Live $10

Credit card $10

Gym membership $21

That brings my total monthly expenses to about $1076

I have a secured credit card to build my credit with a $200 limit. I use it if I run out of money between paydays, but I pay it off before the due date and make sure I have less than a 30% balance when the bill is due. 

As for debt, I got a car from a car lot in 2017. I was hit by an uninsured/unlicensed driver and the car was totalled. I did not pursue legal actions against the driver (dumb, i know.) After the initial payment, I have not made another payment or even acknowledged their attempts at collecting the debt. The balance on that loan is $8,000 dollars. After being sold to a collection agency, I have not been contacted at all regarding the loan, but it does show on my credit report as a derogatory mark. After getting the secured credit card, my score has gone from 514 to 590 within a couple months.

Ive lived off $400 a month before, so I know I can do it again. I just need help visualizing how I can do that. Ill save $500 for the first week after payday, but by the time I get paid again I'm back at $0.

personalfinance,Student Loan Help - Aggressively Pay Off or Save for the Tax Bomb?,"Long story short, today, my student loans are at about $113,306 principal and $8,750 unpaid interest. Since 2016 I have been enrolled in the PAYE program and have seen my total loan balance hover around $121,000 without making much of an impact, in fact climbing slightly. I need help deciding if I should be focusing on paying off as much as I can each month (and if so, which loan do I tackle first) or if I should pay the minimum PAYE monthly payment and save for the inevitable “tax bomb.” Below are some details on my private loans, some credit card debt I have, and the federal loans I’m having the most trouble with. Any help or wisdom would be much appreciated as I try to navigate this crazy, lonely world of crippling student loan debt!!

**Private Loans**

Almost one year ago, I consolidated my private loans into one through CommonBond which I will pay off by April 2028. The total balance of this loan is currently $27,039 and I pay $334 per month.

**Credit Card Debt**

I also have a good amount of credit card debt I’ve built up over the years. In 2017, I reconsolidated most of it into a loan through UNFCU where I have a current balance of $3,740 and pay $245 a month. This loan will be paid off by January 2021.

In addition, I have about $5,400 across various credit cards that I am paying off aggressively each month. I have been prioritizing this debt before my student loans.

It’s also worth mentioning I’ve been working on building up my credit score which is currently around 742 (from around 675 one year ago!).

**Federal Loans**

I enrolled in the PAYE program for my federal loans in 2016 and have been enrolled since. Loan details are provided below.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Loan #**|Loan Type|Principal Balance|Unpaid Interest|Interest Rate (all fixed rate) |Repayment Term|Monthly Payment|

|**TOTALS**||**$113,306.35**|**$17,004.26** |||**$422.48**|

Of most importance, I’ve been putting an extra $150 towards these loans each month. For several months, I had the total spread out among each loan but last month I tried putting the entire extra $150 to Loan #7 to see the impact it might have. Truth be told, I’m not sure what is the smartest move for allocating the extra money each month. Should I target the highest amount of unpaid interest? The highest principal? Some combination of both.

I also wonder if it’s worth paying the extra money or not. For the past several years, the total principal + interest I owe has not budged from \~$121,000 despite having already paid thousands, in fact is still going up slightly. It is frustrating as I don’t have that much free income and feel that it’s being wasted attempting to solve my loan issue. I’m aware that when these loans are forgiven after 20 years of payments, I will be faced with a large “tax bomb.” Part of me thinks it might make more sense to pay the minimum PAYE monthly payments and save the extra $150 per month to tackle the inevitable tax bomb.

HELP!

Another thing I’m uncertain of is my “repayment term” for each loan. As of today, I have made 33 payments to each of my loans. However, on the fedloan website each loan has a different number of months listed for “repayment term,” ranging 130 – 144 months (see table above). Where does this come from and is this how many more payments before each will be forgiven?

* Private Loans (four) - $1800/m (13% apr) ($54,000 total) (holy fucking shit we fucked ourselves with irresponsibility #1)
* Credit Cards (seven) - $1300 (22%) ($50,000 total) (holy fucking shit we fucked ourselves with irresponsibility #2)

**Debt: $231,000, min monthly payments $4,190**

* House - $1,250/m (owe $160k, worth $200k)

**Debt with house: $391,000, min monthly payments with house $5,440**

**The bills:**

* Electric $200 (average)
* Water $90
* Cell phone $120
* Internet &amp; Cable $190
* Car Insurance $160
* Gas	$110
* Food $800 (family of four) (edit: also includes all household consumables like toilet paper, etc)
* Auto fuel $40

Total bills: **$1,710**

**Net:**

**$7,450 - $5,440 - $1,710 = -$300**

We're adding to our credit card debt monthly and that assumes no unexpected expenses, co-pays, etc.

I work full time from home. My wife is raising our kids. (Edit: youngest is special needs and we’re trying to keep him home with her as long as possible before sending him off to school, however we talked today and are looking at working some opposite shifts). Our oldest is in grade school our youngest starts kindergarten next year. My wife has a four year degree as do I. I do some moonlighting which brings in about $400/m currently at a rate of $30/hour (not included above in my income total) and I am hoping to expand that to about $1000/m if I can find an additional 2-3 clients to work with nights/evenings. Even with a more robust moonlighting roster we will be adding debt when any 'unexpected' bills come up during the year (car repairs, etc).

What do I do? I know I can work at Target (or the equivalent) for $13/h on nights/weekends. That would bring in about $800/m after taxes I believe. I am actively reaching out to prospects and consider $30/h to be the low end of my rate ($50-75 is my goal). My wife can work half days next year after kid goes to school.

I've sold every toy I own; no gaming systems, hobbies, etc. I only own my laptop for work. My wife has about $2000 of remaining hobby/collection things we are selling. We've been selling off random things for $5-10 at a time as we clear out our basement, find old kid toys, some furniture pieces.

Tell me I'm missing something, there is a strategy to follow, or I am somehow (currently) being stupid/irresponsible. I am all ears and my feelings cannot be hurt.

Edit also we own one small car, paid off, worth about $6k",finance

personalfinance,Decreasing Emergency Fund,"I just want to preface this by saying I am EXTREMELY fortunate to be in such a unique financial situation. I am very lucky to be so secure. 
I wanted to get opinions on decreasing my emergency fund to contribute to a taxable account. My HYSA with Citizens Access has dropped again in the last 4 months to 2.0% So i felt now would be a good time to look at pulling some out. 

Main Details:
Only Debt is Mortgage $2100 a month

Bills:
Re-occurring obligatory monthly bills (daycare, car insurance, mortgage, Internet, etc): $4300
We spend around another $1000 on discretionary spending : grocery, entertainment, home depot haha, etc

So the $30,000 would cover about 7 months of obligatory spending (of course cell phone, internet, etc isn’t a necessity if the SHTF like that).



Net Monthly household income (after all 401k &amp; Roth contributions, but before bills):
$8100 ($2100 wife’s)

I currently have a taxable account with a 70/30 split of Stock &amp; Tax exempt bonds. 
I’m thinking of pulling $10-$15,000 out of the Emergency fun and investing in a Total Stock or s&amp;p 500 fund. I’m justifying this all in my head by saying that I really don’t plan to use this money ever, but if I did it would be years down the road. And i should throw it in the stock market. If I do that though I wasn’t sure if I should do it in one fell swoop or break the investments up in chunks over a few months to spread some risk.

My monthly bills are  Mortgage/Common Charges/Light/Gas/Cable/Internet/Cell Phone/Condo Insurance/Car Insurance/charity. Rounded this is $2400 per month. I rent out a room in my home and that is what I use for spending money, food, clothing and entertainment.  


After taxes, insurance, fsa and 401k I take home $3700.00 Once bills are paid I have $1300 left per month and I put $500.00 in savings leaving me with $800. I had been using the $800.00 to pay student loans but I finished with them now.    
What do I do with the $800 now.  I only get 2% interest on my saving so I what something that does better than that.   
Do I use it to paydown my mortgage? My interest rate is 3.8 percent. I owe around $280,000 but real-estate in my area has gone up a lot and its worth about $650,000 based on sales of units like mine in my building and I am not planning on moving right now but this is not my forever home(I hope).

personalfinance,"Paying for grad school, loans vs investments","I just applied to grad school, which will start in June 2020 (assuming I am accepted). The program will take two years full time, going year round and cost about 20k. 

I am weighing the options of taking out loans to pay for it vs using my currently invested money. Federal grad loan interest rates are currently sitting at 6.08%, and my investments (typical 3 fund index portfolio) have returned about 2.3% since January (so not great). I have about 4k in a HYSA earmarked specifically for college. I have ~13k in a Roth IRA, ~13k in a taxable brokerage account, and ~5k in a 401k. I also have a 6 month emergency fund and I am planning to work part time to cover living expenses. 

If I were to use my 4k earmarked for college and the 13k in the taxable account I could almost pay for all of school without loans. Is that the best option? If so, should I take the 13k out of the market now or take it out as I need it? It’s hard to say what the market will do, so the safest option would be to pull it all out but I could also lose out doing that. Other possible large expenses include a wedding and a new vehicle (mine *should* last through grad school but it is getting up in years and miles). Wedding will likely be after grad school but soon after. 

Also, should I redirect the money I have going into my Roth and 401k to saving for college instead? I feel like it’s a bit late to make much of a difference but it may help cover the last 3k I need.

I recently graduated from my graduate program in the last year and now have a steady job with a lot of opportunities in the coming months. That does come paired with a nice income for the first time in my life, but I want to be proactive and use it in a pragmatic way.

27 year old male. Work in healthcare.

Currently my debt liabilities include:

Student Debt

$127,300 total to date. Paid off $7,000 already. Interest rate varies for the individual loans, but $50000 of it is at a fixed rate of 6.3%. The remainder is divided up with varying interest rates ranging from 3.6% to 5.8%. The average is 5.4%. Note that only $4,000 is at that low 3.6% interest rate.

Monthly payment is currently $1380. I've been paying $2,000 towards it at the moment.

Car Loan

I had my 8 year old college beater die on me suddenly before starting work. Got a precertified used car for around $19,000 with &lt;40,000 miles. Loan rate wasn't great at this time as I was still broke and didn't have much of a down payment. My loan was around $18,000 about 7 months ago. Currently it is at $13,800 around 6.5% fixed. Looking to refinance that was well with a credit unionMonthly payment is currently $380. I've been paying $500 towards it and any extra money I come into.

Currently my assets include:

Income ranging from $106,000 to $120,000 per year before taxes. I expect that to increase by 30%  next year if things go well. Benefits include 401K, but no matching for 12 month, and health insurance.

I am following a strict living budget and allocating the monthly amounts specified above towards my loans, $500 for emergency savings, $1,000 for my wedding, and $500 for a Roth IRA.

My current concern is student loan refinancing. I have no interest in loan repayment so that detriment doesn't concern me as I am not eligible for it anyways. I've been looking at Sofi for refinancing and consolidating both loans into $127,000 with a fixed rate of 4.5% with 5 years repayment. Monthly payment of roughly $2400. That is very doable for me if I budget accordingly. I would also then only pay roughly $5,000 per year in interest and can write off $3,500 of that in taxes. Would that be my best course of action at this point? Any other recommendations? I appreciate your time.",finance
Forex,Technical Strategy for High Impact News Trading,"After my [1:20 RR buys on EURUSD after the ECB event](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/d373rf/looks_like_a_good_buy_fading_ecb_news_on_eurusd/), I got a lot of questions about news trading. 

These buys were a slight adaption of a strategy I have that is only for trading news events. I've attached a write up of the strategies engagement rules and risk controls to explain things I do and do not do in news events (If I trade them at all). 

  


# News Momentum Follow / Fade  

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategy Objective** 

To find opportunities where high RR trades can be achieved in short periods of time, due to increased volatility in the market after news events. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategy Method**

The strategy is fully technical analysis based, but uses a trigger of strong moves on high impact news events to filter for trading opportunities. The news events have to be important (interest rates etc). Price action has to make a consistent move in the first 10 minutes (no whipsaw ranges).  

The strategy will define areas before the news event where price might breakout in a trend, or reverse after a trend correction. These areas will be marked in, if there is strong momentum into these areas after the news event, the strategy will place limit orders to enter at strong RR prices. 

When the news is against the trend, we are looking to fade it from key retrace areas. When it’s with the trend, we look for continuations after breakouts. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategy Engagement Rules**

There must be high impact, scheduled news. This will usually only be interest rate decisions, although there will be some exceptions to this. 

The pairs on watch lists must have overall trending conditions on larger charts, and support/resistance zones taken from these charts. 

No action can be taken before the news event, or in the 10 minutes after the news event. 

Market entries are not permitted. Limit orders must be used to reduce slippage risks. 

Strong moves are required. Over 100 pips in the first 15 minute close. 

A brief period of consolidation has to follow the initial spike. Even using limits, orders are not placed while price has strong momentum. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategy Risks** 

The obvious risks for this strategy are volatility and execution. It deals with these in multiple ways. Since entries are made after the news and during consolidation with limit orders, slippage on entries is not a problem. The main threat is slippage on stops. These will usually be 50 pips or so, so are unlikely to massively rack up larger losses in slips. Fills on profitable exits should be fine. These will usually take a few hours at least, and liquidity will have returned to normal.

The added volatility can add some more possible variance, but this is balanced out by good entries being able to get 1:10 RR trades in only hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategy Trading Frequency and Duration** 

This strategy will usually only trade on a few occasions per month. It’s trading activity will be centralised around the times there are interest rate decisions from major central banks. Losing trades will usually be complete in under 4 hours. Winning trades 12 - 18 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Position Structure** 

Positions for this strategy will be opened in block of five trades. These will be limit orders spaced out evenly in a grid formation in a possible reversal zone. All positions will be of equal size and use the same amount of pips in stops, but have different profit targets at various RR points. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Money Management** 

This strategy uses the same amount of risk in all net positions. 

Stop losses are applied when opening all trades to cap risk. 

This can be as low as 0.1%, or even lower (on suitable funds). 

No more than 1 losing trade allowed on one day. 

No more than 4 losing trades allowed in one week.",finance

personalfinance,Employer matches 401k contributions up to 5%...but of what?,"I know this will end up being a question for my HR department, but I want to go in there more informed than I am now. And maybe someone can clear this up for me beforehand.

Salary is ~110k/yr. Employer's policy on the website is:

  - &lt;employer&gt; matches your 401(k) contributions (pre-tax and Roth post-tax combined) dollar-for-dollar up to the first 5% of your &lt;employer&gt; pay (subject to the annual limits specified by federal law).

  - &lt;employer&gt; only contributes a match during months in which you have made a contribution

(I'm doing pre-tax only.) I set my contribution percentage so that it finishes well before the end of the year. My 9/15 paycheck topped out my contribution at $19k already for the year with a final $64. The employer matched that $64, so I guess they've also finished for the year. (Not to mention I can't contribute in any other months, so they won't either, according to policy.)

Employer contributed $4,346.68 for the year, which is 5% of only an $87k salary.

I don't understand this on two levels. 

1. Why aren't they contributing a total of around $5500, i.e. 5% of $110k?

2. In the first month, when I contribute $1200 (or whatever), why don't they also contribute $1200 (""dollar for dollar"")? Transaction history shows me contributing $1200, them contributing $250.

It *seems* like they are assuming I'm going to get exactly up to $19k over the course of the year and they are going to spread their match out over the year as well. But would they be that dumb? Why don't they just contribute ""dollar for dollar""?

Edit: OK, so maybe I figured it out. They are contributing up to 5% *of that paycheck* each time, not *of my total pay*. Isn't that both much harder to use and also contra the ""dollar for dollar"" policy?",finance

personalfinance,I have no idea what I'm doing with my finances.,"Title is pretty self-explanatory and I'm in need of some guidance. Maybe someone here could shine a light down a path? Here is a breakdown of my finances, bills, debt, etc. I am 30 year old male, single, no kids.

*earnings* 

Just started a new job. It is hourly, and I'm making $25/hr with incentives and overtime available every week. Gross pay the last three paychecks has averaged around $3,300. 

Company offers matching 401k (I am contributing 7%). They also offer a Roth IRA (I am contributing 5%). 

*bills* 

$210 car payment a month. 

$90 insurance. 

$80 cell phone. 

$30 gym membership.

I still owe $6k on the car at a 3.8% interest rate. Car was purchased new in 2017. 

*debt* 

I owe 65k in student loans. Still in my grace period and have not had to start making payments on. They are technically three separate loans, each with an 8.5% interest rate. One loan is 23k, one is 22k, and the other is 19k. 

I recently moved back in with my parents after living out of state for the last six years due to my father's recent medical issues. No rent, no mortgage, etc. That said, I am currently looking at homes in the 75k-100k price range (""looking"" as in ""going on realtor.com and seeing what's out there""). 

My economic goals are to be debt free (student loans and car) and to purchase a house. 

I guess I'm wondering if I should pay off my car in full now and start attacking my student loans before I exit my grace period? Paying off the car in full would leave me around 6k as a security fund with my remaining bills at $200 (insurance, cell phone, gym). 

I've heard that paying off your car in full early can screw with your credit score? I'm currently hovering around 740 and have been told my score would be higher but I dont have much credit history. I guess that would be a deterrent to paying off the car note early - an opportunity to make payments, establish history, bolster my score for when I am more actively looking to purchase a home. 

I guess I just need some general advice. I'm making the most money I've ever made but am unsure if I need to contribute to a 401k when trying to get out of debt? Should I use that 6k to pay off my car and just start hurling all of that into my student loans instead? (Avalanche v. Snowball?) 

Any help, insight, experience would be most welcomed. Thanks, y'all.

**EDIT** 

Here is some more general info that others have requested. 

My net pay averages around $2k. I get paid bi-weekly. I take $1k from every check and put it directly into savings. 

Because I live at home and care for my father, my cost of living is relatively low. No rent, no mortgage. I contribute around $100 in groceries every week (for 3 people). I rarely go out to eat (less than $50 a week). I don't do much for myself in terms of entertainment. Dont drink. A ""night out"" for me is usually a $3 cup of coffee and a pack of American Spirits ($9) at a coffee shop. I live in the midwest so everything here is cheap.",finance

personalfinance,Can a Perkins Loan just disappear?,"So this is a fairly convoluted story so I apologise in advance...

My freshman year I was at a university and took out federal loans and specifically a Perkins Loan of $2000. I transfered my sophomore year to another university where I had other Perkins loans. 

Since I transfered, every year I've received a letter from ACS (now Conduent) saying I owed $2000 but I deffered them since I was still in school. Now I've graduated and am organizing what I owe, and I have not received anything from them. Usually I have received a letter from them by now.

To make things even weirder, I have no record of this loan existing on my credit score! My credit card breaks all of them down and every perkins and Stafford loan is there but not this one. Also, when I go on the conduent website they have no record of my info when I try to make an account. 

The only thing I can think of is this loan somehow turned into a Stafford loan. I noticed that for the year I was at the first university I have 3 Stafford loans, one being $2000, compared to 2 from other years. I don't even know if this is possible, but it's the only thing I can think of.

I will be calling both the loan provider and my original school tomorrow but I need some closure now because it's really bugging me!!

TL;DR: took our Perkins Loan but can't find any record of it existing. What do I do?",finance

I plan on moving back with my parents so I can stay at home and work. I want stop paying for rent and reduce my expenses. I want allocate all the expense money to paying off my debt. $550 for rent, $260 for food, $180 on gas hopping to reduce this too. I was debating on whether I should sell my car or keep the car. If I sell it thou I would be losing $9k. So it's not worth it atm. It's a 2018 kia Rio EX. Got it on a good deal (.99 interest, 15 free oil change, tires).From what I believed in atm. Sales people are deceptive.

That's my plan. As for the long run I want jump into real estate and more. I just want a fast way of reducing all my expense so I can start as fast as possible. I want to save up too 40% or more of my income if possible. I am already saving up a few more. I have a Questrade direct investing account open. With a few stocks ETFs from BlackRock and vanguard and a few stocks. I have them through my TFSA. I am planning on closing my RBc to keep my tangerine open for daily chequing and saving. I have my BMO open and that's where I do all my expenses and receive my paycheck and my car loan. BMO because they can waive your fee once you have $3k in your account. RBC requires a lot. To have a bundle which I don't with them to be able to waive my fees. BMO and tangerine are my banks for  now.

I have a mastercard with Roger Fido. Best Mastercard at a point in time. Cant close it now because it would impact my credit score. I do have another one with BMO and its 11% interest rate. That's the preferred Mastercard. I had the student SPC with 21% interest which I switched to lower my interest rate. I plan on opening up one with tangerine. So in the future I could close either the BMO one or the Roger's Fido one.

Looking for some suggestions and ideas to help reduce my debt quicker, stocks to look into, ways to do things different, books to read, business idea, videos or podcasts to listen too. 

I want look into real estate and open a club in the future. Right now I am trying to open an investment club or group with friends that I can trust to fund money quickly. Interest fee. Suggestions.

personalfinance,Roth 403(b) versus traditional 403(b),"For a little background, I’m 25, single with no kids, and just got a full time job where my gross salary is $90K. 

Debt: student loans (35K at a 6% interest rate, and am 1 year into paying them off at $400 monthly- standard plan, so 9 years left)

No credit card debt, and my car is paid off. 

I can comfortably pay all my bills and still have money left to create an emergency fund. I currently have 3 months of living expenses saved but would like to up it to 6 months now that I’m getting paychecks from the new job.

My employer contributes 7% of my salary to either the traditional or Roth accounts,  but I want to max out my personal contribution too.

I live alone and have a car but don’t have that many expenses so I only need about 25K a year to live, including paying my loans.

Before this I worked part time and my salary was way lower, so I’ve never had the option to save for retirement before.


I have a few questions-

Which account would be better in my situation, the traditional or the Roth 403B? 
Should I be making extra payments on my student loans now that I have the new job? Planning on double payments (800 a month) so far but could maybe pay more than that if I didn’t max out the 403B.
Is it better to max out the 403B or pay my student loans off as quickly as possible?

personalfinance,Help - migrant to USA needs advice on everything,"I have just moved to the USA at the age of 34. Back home interest rates were high and I left my money (US$48,000) in a savings account accruing about 4%. I have a managed retirement fund which I cannot do much with (state mandated) but it will grow nicely on its own.

Anyway, I moved here and there are so many paths to take regarding my money and interest rates are so low there's no point having any sitting long term.

Here are my finances:

* Salary (pre-tax): $150,000
* 401k contributions: work matches 4% of first 8% of my pay
* Opted for Roth 401k, current balance \~$1,000 (I'm only just starting!)
* Current savings: $48,000
* Emergency fund: $8,000
* Budgeted savings contribution: $32,000
* No debt
* Retirement fund back home: $60,000 (untouchable until I am retirement age).

My bank (large multinational) wants me to invest the $48,000 in their investment program. They estimate 7-8% return with a 1.5% fee. I am growing the emergency fund to two month's salary (currently at my last income level) - $16,000.

My questions:

1. What should I do with my money? Does the bank's investment seem like a good use? I think the fees are lower once my investment hits $100,000.
2. Did I choose well with the Roth 401k? Co-workers all do it this way but I was on the fence about when to pay the tax.
3. Should I open an IRA too? Roth IRA?
4. Is there going to be a bust soon? It seems to me like the world's economy is cyclical and everyone is always ranting about a recession etc. I am not an expert in money, to be honest before this job I never had a lot of it.

Thanks in advance for any advice. I am looking long term here - at least 55 to retire. I am not looking at early financial independence just yet.",finance

personalfinance,The importance of bonds on aggregate performance:,"Bonds DO serve a tremendous purpose in your portfolio.

As an aside, I am young and I enjoy risks. Well, being that I have a somewhat competent understanding of the market, I would want to be in 100% equities, right? Well, it’s more complicated than that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*How do bonds make money?*

Bonds are debt. It’s a loan by which you provide capital now in exchange for more capital returned down the road. 

 [https://imgur.com/a/APcV0Al](https://imgur.com/a/APcV0Al)

&amp;#x200B;

**Bond Convexity:**

Back in the 1980s when bonds were paying upwards of 10%, they looked attractive. Nowadays, we are in an environment with record low interest rates that are even negative in some situations. So, what’s the point of having bonds in the portfolio at all?

*The effect of convexity on returns:*

Theoretically, a 30-year bond with a negative interest rate experiences 2x the gains of that with a 10% IR even if the underlying rates change -1%. It doesn’t make sense, does it?

It’s absolutely true, and it’s due to something called bond convexity. Bond convexity basically means that the sensitivity of a bond to interest rate changes is not constant. It’s also not linearly related to rates. In fact, it *accelerates* as rates drop, and the amount of acceleration depends on how much time is left on the bond. The duration listed in the fund description is not wrong by any means, but like glancing at the speedometer while your car accelerates down the highway, it’s simply a snapshot of an ever-moving target that follows a much more complex set of mathematical rules than you realize.

To understand bond convexity, let’s use the same 1% rate change sensitivity measured by duration but map the real-world results over every interest rate for a variety of different bond maturities. When looking at this chart, keep in mind that this is NOT the results of a backtest. It’s a fundamental equation for how bonds work.

 [https://imgur.com/a/6K1SSGW](https://imgur.com/a/6K1SSGW)

In plain terms, bond convexity measures the curvature of the lines. Here you can see that while the line for 5-year bonds is relatively flat at all different starting interest rates, the convexity effect gets more and more pronounced the longer the maturity of the bond. 30-year bonds are especially sensitive to rate changes at the low end of the scale, and even with negative interest rates can experience massive gains with only small declines in rates.

But this chart is only for capital appreciation, so let’s combine it with the first one we discussed earlier and look at the total return including the interest payment.

 [https://imgur.com/a/5GAzW9a](https://imgur.com/a/5GAzW9a)

To me, this is where it starts to get really interesting. All lines show the total return of a bond with a 1% drop in rates. Look at the total return of a 30-year bond at a 10% interest rate and compare it to one with a -1% interest rate. Would you have guessed that result? How might that affect how you think about the role of long term bonds in a portfolio?

 [https://imgur.com/a/vy23wWj](https://imgur.com/a/vy23wWj)

So, what’s the point of this? Because of convexity, bonds have more income at low or negative IR than people realize.

**How do we apply this knowledge?**

The Fed is currently taking a patient, wait and see approach with IRs. Will rates go higher? Lower? I couldn’t tell you. But if you’re worried about unequal risk, know that at the most volatile maturities, the risk is asymmetrical and weighted to the upside. Building on this idea, it’s best to have a different basket of maturities in your portfolio. For example, since the volatility of 30yr maturities is higher than short term bills, the high beta of an uncorrelated asset to stocks is a very desirable characteristic and is a big part of how they work.

**Again, how do bonds fit into my portfolio?**

Well, let me start again by giving you an example using drawdowns. You have $100,000 to invest and you put it into a total stock market fund. If the market drops 50%, [you now need a 100% gain](https://imgur.com/a/NL8xpVS) just to break even. Because of the high equity exposure, this has historically been achievable in 7-12 years (again, you could just use the rule of 72).

 [https://imgur.com/a/z1djQJa](https://imgur.com/a/z1djQJa)

Let’s take another example. We will start with the same $100,000, but this time we only lose 15% of our portfolio. We would only need 17.76% gain to break even in this example rather than the 100% gain in the first example.

We could argue about portfolio theory and asset allocation until we’re blue in the face, and no one portfolio fits all. The question comes down is it worth sacrificing some potential upside to protect yourself on the downside. The answer is most definitely. Ray Dalio built the “all weather portfolio” which does just this. His portfolio is constructed of 30% stocks, 55% bonds, 7.5% commodities, and 7.5% gold. Seems AWFULLY conservative, right? Well, his average return was 5.3% and was only negative 27% of the time. Well, if he didn’t outperform the inflation-adjusted return of SPX (8%), how did he beat the market? Because he protected himself on the downside, he was able to recover from losses much faster than most investors, [thus boosting his CAGR.](https://imgur.com/a/YUWtn6i)

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

Every portfolio has a tradeoff as there is no such thing as a free lunch. If your goal is income, be weighted more toward bonds than you are equities.

As a final example: I am very young. I am 20 years old and plan on retiring in 45 years (hopefully earlier, but let’s not plan on that). I want $500k and let’s say all I can do is fund an IRA (6000). If I am 100% stock, it’ll take me [between 16 and 28 years to do that](https://imgur.com/a/jzeG2AJ).

If I switch up my allocation to 55% stocks, it cuts down the volatility and [increases the probability that I will hit my goal sooner.](https://imgur.com/a/QA3IN3G)

personalfinance,"Started medical school, parents helping pay half of cost, best way to save money with the plan of paying all the interest after 4 years?","I've been a long time lurker of the subreddit, hopefully someone can offer some advice on my situation now.

**Background**

So I started medical school a month ago and want to make sure I figure all my loan information straight so I don't run into too much trouble at the end of 4 years. I am 23yo. Currently, the tuition is split into 3 'quarters', with about $20k due each trimester. I have also signed up with my school to pay monthly rather than a bulk sum at the beginning of the trimester. In addition, at the moment my parents are covering part of the cost, so I've only had to take unsubsidized loans and no GRAD Plus loans. For the August-October time period, I have $13.5k in loans approved, at a 6.080% interest rate. Starting next August, my parents will probably not be able to continue helping as much with tuition, and I'll request an additional $6.5k at 7.080%. By the end of school, I'll have around $210k in loans most likely. I have no loans from undergraduate, I payed it all through scholarships.

In terms of expenses, I'm lucky to have my parents helping me out with rent, utilities, gas, and food. I get ~$400 from them to budget on everything except rent, which they fully pay. So far, I've stayed well under the $400/month, cooking at home and not spending much. I sustained this throughout college so I have no worries I'll be able to maintain this spending limit. In the past, I also engaged in investing activities including options (Wheel strategies) as well as futures trading. From those, I've got about $25k in savings. However, I no longer have the same risk tolerance with these huge loans, so I'm looking at ways to save my money while being able to minimize the effective interest rate on the loans. 

**Plan**

I don't have to pay a penny of interest until 6 months after graduation in 2023, when it all capitalizes, so my plan is to put aside the money I would have paid in interest in a separate account to ensure I will have it after 4 years, and potentially purchasing longer term CDs and bonds to minimize my risk and hopefully lower the effective (not sure if I'm using the right terminology here, apologies) interest rate. I am thinking of putting a significant amount of the $25k in these safe holdings so as not to have it sitting around in a savings account at 0.4% only. In terms of emergency, once again I'm lucky enough to live 40 minutes from my parents that I don't have a need to have a large emergency fund, at least for the time being.

**Question**

My question is is this the best way to go about my loans, and if it is, is this the best way to save the money or would I end up wasting more on fees to nullify any gain I might get with so small a fund. I don't want to put it in the broad market just because I 100% need to have all the money at the end of 4 years to pay the interest, I don't have time to weather a potential downturn when that deadline hits.",finance
personalfinance,Should I take out a 401k loan to pay off my car?,"I know this is generally considered a bad idea. The main reason I'm considering it is so my car can be paid off immediately (instead of an estimated 8-9 months) and I can stop paying for ""full collision coverage"" insurance. The insurance costs me about $200 a month, and I estimate I could get that bill down to $70-$100 once the car is no longer being financed. 

I still owe about $2350 on my car, with a pretty low interest rate (I think it's like 2.97% or something). The monthly payment is $277 and with my other bills I can't reasonably afford to pay much more, if any, toward it to pay it off faster. I'm considering a 401k loan of $2750 at 6.25% APR, which would let me immediately pay off the car and change my insurance plan ASAP.

Part of the reason I want to go through with this plan is my current budget is very tight, leaving me close to no money for an emergency fund, or for making payments above the minimum on credit card debts. Optimistically, paying off the car and lowering my insurance premiums might come to nearly $400 a month saved. Even if I start putting $300/month into the 401k loan that's still $100/month of extra liquidity to insulate me against unforeseen expenses, etc.

In case anyone asks, I've already cut my unnecessary spending almost entirely. I'm not looking for advice on frugality, just on the wisdom of this repayment strategy in particular.

personalfinance,"Total beginner, where do I start (US, NL)","I want to start understanding a lot more about finance, how to prepare for the future, how to understand investments, stock markets, etc.

A bit of a background:

* \~ 30 years old
* Living in the Netherlands as an expat, where my [30% ruling](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/living/take-care-of-official-matters/highly-skilled-migrants/thirty-percent-ruling) ends December 2020.
* I have my own house, with a linear mortgage of 2.24% interest rate that started last year. House value was €570K. Fixed interest rate is 10 years.
* No savings account. (BTW, Dutch banks are going to have a negative interest rate on these next year)
* Have some stocks from my company, some are vested, some are to be vested over the following years.
* Invested some money in a trade with family, they gained 20% profit, I reinvested them in another trade.
* Responsible for my family of five members, my wife is a housewife taking care of our children.
* Already on a pension plan that my employer and I contribute to.
* No life insurance.

My main questions are:

1. What do you suggest for me to have the basics that could allow me to understand as much as possible about managing my personal finance, so what to read, what to study, things that are relative to my status and my country of living.
2. How can I know what to invest how much and when? I'm not talking about predictions, just what are the basics for taking such decisions?
3. Should I sell all my stocks from my company and invest in ETFs?
4. Should I get a life insurance?

The goal is for me to have enough support for me and my family in case things go wrong in the future, enough for my pension so that I could live a nice life somewhere, probably middle east or Turkey, not looking to become an expert and not looking to have a fortune.

personalfinance,What to do when a rental property reaches maximal depreciation at 27.5 years?,"I’ve been fortunate to own a rental property for over 20 years.  Now though I’m approaching my limit for property depreciation on rental income for taxes. 

Short of a 1031 exchange to a completely different rental - is there something else I could do to maintain the depreciation option?

Some thoughts:
(1) Gift or Sell to a trust that I manage for $1 - I know I’ll have to be responsible for the fed gift tax - but honestly I’m nowhere near that limit with this 
   - in this case would the trust be able to continue depreciation because they are now a “new” owner?

(2) as above - but then buy the property back for $1 - do I count as a brand new owner?

EDIT:  thanks to all that answered.  Totally forgot the depreciation only goes to the initial investment - which would have been $0 or $1.",finance
personalfinance,"Take 10k equity as cash, or take a cheaper house?","Hi y'all, first timer here and just now getting to the point in my life where financial decisions beyond ""don't buy that, you have to buy food"" are coming into play, and I could really use some help.

I am currently looking at buying a house, in which I have 10k in equity built up already. I am very amicable with the owners, who have said I can either purchase the house for the value less the equity, which comes out to 50 bucks less a month in mortgage, or they can cut me a check after buying the house at value, in which case I have 10k with no idea what to do with it.

To just throw it into an account the account would need a crazy high interest rate to beat 600/year in growth, but I know nothing about actual investments other than making sure to put as much as I can into my company retirement fund and be matched. 

- I can afford the mortgage either way; 50 bucks a month is no longer a make or break for me thankfully.
- I have 2k in creditcard debt I've been paying off, that after buying the house I will be able to pay off in 4 months if I do not use money from the 10k
- I have about 30k in student loan debt that I pay about 300 a month on right now. 

Right now the best option I can see is to take the 10k and chunk my student loan debt by a third, which by scratchy math should save me 100 dollars a month and seriously accelerate me paying that off, but I have also never had options to explore with a decent amount of money, and figured I would come by here and see if anyone had suggestions for me to look into on a 10k investment, or if taking the house cheaper would be a good option as well.

personalfinance,"Insane Interest Rate, Need To Refinance","A little background -
I've always bought my cars cash, but in the summer of 2017 the transmission on my '05 GrandAm died. I hated the car anyway, but it was paid for. I couldn't afford to fix it and I was newly married with two part time jobs. (It actually died on my way to work.) We weren't budgeting as well back then, and my brother and my new husband convinced my I had no choice but to finance something. We went to Carmax of all places, and I bought a 2007 Hyundai Sonata SE for $9,088.00 

Unfortunately, with hardly anything to put down and no credit history, I got the worst deal. Financed through Santander with a 28.6% interest rate on a 6 year loan... (Worst mistake of my life.)

My husband bought a Jeep in February of the same year and cosigned on my car that July after we were married but with his recent purchase and only decent credit to begin with, it clearly didn't help much.

We're planning on growing our family soon (we lost of firstborn in June of this year, stillborn.) I want to pay my car off as soon as possibly because we owe less on mine than we do on his Jeep, but the Hyundai comes out of my income and I want to homeschool in the future. I know after looking at the budget that I can pay it off by next October if I save and pay it off at one time. I would like to refinance, however, and lower my interest rate and lower my payment so I can save up a little faster and not pay such a ridiculous amount on interest

QUESTION: where is the best place to refinance for a lower rate, considering I owe more than the car is worth right now? 

I previously spoke to our local credit union (TVA) and they wouldn't refinance more than the car's worth so I would have to pay the difference. (At the time, it was about $3k but that's been about a year or so ago.) My current plan is to do that around tax refund season and save up in the meantime, but if I can go through someone else and not have to spend more money and lower that ridiculous rate sooner, I'd like to do it sooner! 

(My credit score is currently over 720 if that helps. And I'd probably refinance only in my name instead of co-signing.)",finance

I put an offer in on a house on Friday, offer accepted. My offer was $125,500. I need to supply a fridge, washer and dryer. 


I fucked up my credit a little while back. Im down to a median of 660. Conventional loans don’t sound like they are in my favor because of the higher interest rate. I didn’t think I’d have a sufficient amount to put down on the house but my parents just told me they will gift me $10k. My mom would like this all to go towards my mortgage/down payment/closing cost. 


Considering I’d be getting an FHA loan, I can only put down 3.5%. I’m expecting closing costs to be around $5k. As of now, I can cover the 3.5% down payment but I might need help with my closing costs so I don’t eat away at my emergency fund. My mom said to either buy my needed appliances and/or put the rest of the money I don’t use towards my first down payment. 

Between all my accounts (emergency, savings and checking) I have $7,100. I have already paid $1k towards the down payment. My inspection will be $225. Id also like to blow the house with insulation when I get the keys and that’s estimated to be about $500. 


My questions are:
- should I consider a conventional loan now that I have 10k to play with? 


- would it be a good idea to put a fat first mortgage payment down after I use whatever I need for closing? Will that change my monthly payment?


- I suspect I’ll be putting the appliances on a CC and paying it off within 3-4 months. Would it be a better idea to use part of that 10k to pay for appliances? Or put it towards my down payment and use a CC for appliances?

My wife and I are late 20's, got married a month ago. Our relationship is solid, we've been together for 8 years and I completely trust her.  We are both full time employed, plus she's about to start a part time job. She is a school counselor, and has student loans from grad school to the tune of about 65k at an interest rate of about 6.1%. She has made 37 qualifying payments per her last statement. I am very distrustful of the PSLF program. When her loans were transferred from Navient to Fedloan they arbitrarily reset her payments to 0, and we wound up getting a congressmen involved to resolve the situation. I'm debating if it's worth it paying off her loans ourselves, and what might be the best way to do so. I'm not averse to taking out loans or scared of debt, but the PSLF program is a train wreck subject to change depending on which way the political winds are blowing.

Interest free card 2: 6.8k, interest free until 10/2020, minimum of $85/month

We used the credit cards to finance some desperately needed work on our house.

personalfinance,Can one use a wash sale of stock originally obtained through an ISO to extract unclaimed AMT credits during a year with low regular income?,"Hi personalfinance! I’ve got a pretty weird tax situation that I’d appreciate an informed second opinion on.
 
The situation:

I have some shares of stock obtained through an ISO offer from a prior employer.
I exercised the options all at once in 2017, and the large influx of cash on top of some other factors left me with a very high AMT bill (fortunately just about all of it generated an AMT credit as well, most of which is still in carry-forward).
I have made $0 in other income this year (aside from a small sale of this same stock I made earlier this year) and I’m now trying to figure out how to best take maximum tax advantage of the low income for this year (which isn’t likely to continue in the future).

My hypothesis:

Because my tax payment in 2017 generated an AMT credit, I think it is possible to increase the cost basis for some of the shares (useful as it will decrease the net gain when I do eventually sell those shares) and extract some money out of the AMT credit without paying any additional tax by doing a wash-sale of the maximum amount of shares that will not trigger AMT for tax year 2019 (possible because of the high AMT exemption).

Here’s an example to illustrate what I mean:
(Note that for this example/question, I'm asking only about federal taxes, no consideration to state/local required)

Assuming

- Shares: 5000

- Date Exercised: 1/1/2017 (specific date not relevant, just assume all shares are long term cap gains eligible)

- Current share price: $150

- Original ISO strike price: $7.50

- FMV on exercise date: $75

- Unclaimed ATM Credit for 2019: $50,000 (I’m aware this number may not be plausible but it’s not critical to the question, just assume it’s larger than the tax lability for the sale)

- 2019 AMT Exemption: $71,700

- 2019 other income: $0


Then

- The maximum amount of shares that can be sold without any AMT liability would be 956 ( AMT exemption / ( current price - exercise FMV)).

- The regular long-term capital gain on a sale of 956 shares would be $136,230.

- The regular tax liability for 2019 assuming no other income would be ~$11-12k, and because AMT liability is 0 in this case, I would be able to apply the maximum possible credit and reduce my actual taxes owed to $0.


My question(s):

-  Is my understanding of the effect of doing this correct? I have a decent familiarity with the AMT part of the tax code but there is very little specific information available on wash sales in the context of AMT. Will the cost basis be adjusted as I expect, and will I be able to apply the credit to my potential tax bill as I'm expecting?

- Is this a good idea? I don't want to sell the stock now, so the only other option is to do nothing. My impression is that doing this would be beneficial because my otherwise low income in 2019 allows me to claim an unusually large portion of my yet-unclaimed AMT credits, something my typical other income partially or entirely prevents. I’m aware AMT is designed to eventually levy the same taxes, but the money is much more useful to me in my hands than in the government’s, and it may take many years for the credit to be fully utilized.",finance

personalfinance,Balance Transfer Credit Card to Snowball Debt,"Hello PF,

First post here, would love some advice.

I currently have about $10,000 in credit card debt (1 Capital One Card) at 25% interest rate from being unemployed for a period of time.  I do not have a problem over spending, currently have a small emergency fund and am planning on snow ball payments (about $1,000 a month) to get rid of this debt.

I wanted to know what credit card is suggested for a balance transfer as I need:

1. A card that has a limit of or close to $10,000 to transfer the debt to (I have good credit and no other credit cards. Own my car and never been late on a payment)
2. A card that has a low or 0 balance transfer rate, at least for the first few days so I can transfer the balance.
3. A card with 0 interest rate for at least 10 months to pay debt in full without interest. 
4. A card without a balance transfer limit, or a limit that's close to $10,000
4. Rewards would be nice, but are not necessary.

Any recommendations helpful. 

Is a balance transfer card the best move or maybe a loan? 

I'm really concerned about the credit limit of cards as it is (so far) the only thing I can't look up and is fairly variable.


The cards I am looking at currently are:


* a. Discover It Cash Back (looking online seems credit limit is ~$3,000?)

* b. Amex Everday Credit Limit (Max balance transfer $5,000)

* c. HSBC Cash Rewards Mastercard (Lot of negatives reviews on usability, customer service and getting rewards)

* d. Chase Slate (Reviews say very low credit limit given. ~$1000)

Most of the negatives or reviews posted above are from user reviews on NerdWallet, not sure how neutral that website is. 

Again any help appreciated, want to jump on this and get my credit right ASAP!

personalfinance,Recession on the Horizon?,"I might get a lot of flak for this but I am willing to take it in this case.

There has been a lot of recession talk off late. There are quite a few things which are being called precursors to a downturn -

\- US-China trade tensions

\- Lofty corporate debt

\- Rise of negative yields in Europe

\- Possibility of a hard Brexit

\- Last but not the least - the inverted yield curve

I have done a little reading in this context and I still don't see any of these factors causing a downturn apart from corrections like we saw towards the end of 2018.

\- The Fed just cut rates in August

\- Unemployment in US is down

\- Consumer spending and inflation looks good

\- Companies are generally reporting profits despite woes of the trade skirmish.

Here is some of my thoughts -

This is the first time people are consciously looking at the yield curve as a recession predictor since it was first found in the 80s. All the negative yields in EU are probably causing people there to gobble up the 10 year US treasury bills pushing its yield downward. Don't these circumstances rule out the yield curve as a true predictor? Since people are now actively looking at it and taking decisions based on it, it shouldn't be a true predictor like it was as the factors influencing it were purely market based and not investor behavior based. As far as I can see, we aren't in a situation like last time when people were trading CDO's on the market. Are we really at a point where a recession is on the horizon just because the yield curve says so?

I also look at it in another way. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that we can only truly know the velocity or position of a particle. As soon as we shine light on it, it has already displaced a little. On a similar note, as soon as ordinary investors discovered the yield curve and actively started taking decisions based on its shape, we don't really know whether it truly depicts the nature of the market anymore.

TLDR: Is the yield curve inversion really indicating a Recession on the horizon or is it not a useful indicator anymore?",finance

personalfinance,Lost $2500 of my tax return due to it being deposited into the wrong bank account...wondering if it’s at all possible to get back,"Alrighty so first things first, if this belongs in another sub, let me know and I will put it there. But anyway here’s what happened. Back in early 2017(aka this was my 2016 tax return) I filed my taxes like normal and put in my direct deposit info and all that (I use turbo tax btw). So a couple weeks later I’m assuming my return should be hitting my account soon but does not. Another couple weeks go by, still nothing. So at this point I start trying to see if something is up, the IRS has a website called where’s my refund where you basically put in your info and it’ll tell you your refund status. Well I hopped on there and it says it’s been deposited. But I sure as hell hadn’t seen it yet! 

The total amount was like 5k federal and $500 state that I was owed back. So now I’m trying to figure out where this money went, called turbo tax they give me the typical blah blah blah call the IRS blah blah blah. So I call the IRS(which for those of you that have also had the great misfortune of having to call them you know it’s a HUGE pain in the ass). Finally got someone on the other end, ask them why this happened, they just tell me to make sure the numbers in my return match the numbers on my bank account. Which I obviously had already done but went ahead and did again(there is more to this later). I tell them it matches up and they tell me to take my return to my bank and have them verify it as well. So I do that, bank verifies that I put the correct account numbers in when I filed. 

So I call the IRS back and tell them(after another hour on hold lol), and they basically just tell me that as far as they’re concerned they sent the money out and there’s nothing that can be done on their end. So I go to back to the bank and tell them that, and they say well there’s nothing we can do either, we don’t have the money and have no idea where it’s at. So I call the IRS yet again, and if I recall, several more times(this was over 2 years ago so I’m trying to get everything as close as I can remember). Finally they say well we’ll run a probe to find out where this money actually went, they tell me it’ll take 90 days, and it’s already been several months by this point. So finally after the 90 days goes by they tell me that the money was deposited into an account at my bank(this is a small local bank with only a few branches, the money was deposited into an account with the actual physical bank I go to). 

At this point I’m extremely confused as to what the hell happened, and also figured I’d go ahead and call the Ohio tax people and maybe they’d have an idea what happened since I hadn’t gotten my Ohio return back either. Well low and behold I start talking to this guy there and he actually had me read the direct deposit account number to him over the phone. Low and behold IT WAS THE WRONG DAMN NUMBER. I had switched two digits at the very end of the number. I couldn’t believe it, I swear I checked it 3 or 4 times before I submitted it on turbo tax, and at least that many again when I was checking to make sure I put the right number down after I didn’t get my return. EVEN THE BANK VERIFIED THIS NUMBER. So basically what happened was the bank put my federal and state return into the wrong account. 

So when I go tell the bank that this is what happened, they look up the account and find that yes, the money did go into it. Also they find that the account only had a balance of $3014. Aka 2500 less than my full refund was for because the person had spent it. So they freeze the account and tell me to call the IRS and see what we should do. Can’t remember exactly what the IRS said but what happened afterwards is the bank withdrew the $3014, sent it to the IRS, and the IRS sent it to me in a physical check in the mail. But now I’m still $2500 short and both the bank and the IRS are telling me that they can’t do anything and that I need to talk to the other one. This goes on for months of me calling the IRS weekly and talking to the bank whenever I was there and getting absolutely nowhere. Finally I kind of just gave up. Well earlier today I was thinking about all that and it was pissing me off that it happened the way it did so I figured I’d ask and see if there was anything that could be done to get the rest of my money back, or whether I should just forget it. 

That was pretty long so here’s the TLDR

-$5500 dollar tax return filed in 2017 through turbo tax for 2016 tax year

-several weeks go by and I still haven’t got a direct deposit with my return

-get on the site https://www.irs.gov/refunds to find out where my refund is

-site says it was direct deposited a couple weeks before

-call IRS they tell me to check my account numbers I put on the return, I do and I also take it to bank and they check it

-account number is WRONG somehow both I and the bank missed this multiple times

-I found out the account that it went into, and also that only $3014 of the 5500 is in the account

-I get $3014 back in a check after the bank sent the money from that account to IRS who sent it to me

-months go by of me trying to get the rest back to no avail, I pretty much just gave up



Also- I am quite aware that I was the one who put the wrong account number on my return, and also that this was over 2 years ago so there may be nothing to be done here. But my thought is that the bank should never have put a tax return into an account that didn’t match the name on the return in the first place?? Also they verified the numbers after I had them check which gave whoever got the money months more time to spend it. Also I’ve read some stories on here of banks taking care of losses people had due to things that were entirely their fault(scams and such) and was curious as to whether I should try to go higher up the levels in my bank and try to get this back. I might even keep them as a bank if they fix it, if not I am definitely going to a new bank, they were incredibly unhelpful throughout the entire process and everyone should have a bank they can trust to do everything in there power to fix situations like these.

personalfinance,Need help with repayment strategy!,"Hi all, thanks for taking the time.

I have recently taken control of my spending after making some very dumb mistakes in the past. I have set a budget and am very motivated to get out of debt. Here's my situation:

$8900 personal loan @ 24% I took out to pay off CC debt. 

$3000 CC debt @ 18%

I stupidly took out a loan at a higher interest rate than my CC to pay them off. Frankly I just wanted/needed to cut the card and get out of it.

After doing this, I came across the idea of doing balance transfer cards to avoid interest.

So, I applied and was approved today to a discover balance transfer card that has 0% interest for 18mos with a $7400 limit.

As well, I was approved for a Citi balance transfer card with 0% interest for 21mos with a $1500 limit.

I can put $1000/mo toward debt repayment. This might seem like a dumb question, but how should I structure my balance transfers so I can pay the least amount of interest? 

My goal is to be debt free by August 2020 since I will likely be starting a PhD program. I have 2 months between now and then when I will get an ""extra"" paycheck that month because I am paid bi-weekly, so that should accelerate the process significantly. As well as my tax return in April.

I make about 2200/mo so I have significantly cut my expenses down to get to where I can do $1000/mo.

personalfinance,"Think I Should Have Filed Taxes Last Year, Questions About Self-Employment","Okay so this is going to sound extremely harebrained on my part, bear with me. 

I started working for someone last year as a typist/research assistant and I made around $1,071 from it, no other income besides a school stipend for staffing that as far as I know doesn't count as income (pls let me know if I'm mistaken, if I am, it was a $1200 stipend roughly). Here's the harebrained part: I didn't file taxes this year for the money I made, and I also didn't know I needed to pay quarterly taxes as a sole proprietorship/self-employed person. I hadn't even really registered in my head that that's what I was until a week ago. This year I've made around 7200 dollars so far, same work. Most of the money I've made from this job I have in savings, so I can afford a hit. I have a few questions. 

How bad are the penalties going to be for me when I call up the IRS and tell them I goofed? Is there any way to get those lessened or waived? Around what amount am I going to be expected to pay? I'm also slightly disoriented at how to catch up on these quarterly payments I'm supposed to be doing. 

I live in California, I'm 22, I'm a dependent, live at home, spent no money on this job, have no kids, am a full-time college student if that gives any more context.

I want to turn this financial mishap into a more favorable one: 

* I could refinance the car and get a better interest rate with my credit compared to my father's. Plus I want to get the car in my name since I've been paying it off for a year to build credit.

* Have my father voluntarily repo the car and I shop for a better deal. Since my dad is about to retire very soon and his credit is awful that it would take a decade to get it anywhere remotely average I thought this wouldn't be such a bad thing.

* Or just aggressively pay it off post orthognatic surgery when money's not tight and stick with it?

personalfinance,Paying an accountant for tax consultation,"Im a self-employed dual citizen (US/CA) and would like to pay an accountant for an hour of their time to ask them tax questions. Either in person (Windsor / Detroit area) or over the phone (In person may be better as I will have their undivided attention, although phone should be fine).

Questions will mostly revolve around self-employment income and how its affected in different scenarios on both sides of the border (federally, provincially, state-wise) and how I can lower my tax liabilities. I also have questions regarding different US states and how how residing in each will affect my tax liabilities. My main inquiry is how I can structure myself to pay the absolute lowest taxes possible for my income, and which state/province may offer me this opportunity - including what business tax structures I should take advantage of. I also have general questions on RRSPs, healthcare and real estate, etc.

Because I need someone to think through different tax scenarios and suggest what structures they feel would be best for my business I need someone who is both inquisitive and experienced with Canadian and US taxes.

Does anyone have any suggestions on accountants / firms that could provide such service or where I should look? Are their certain firms I should look to avoid?

The advice of this accountant will influence life changes I make such as moving states / countries so im being picky about finding an experienced individual with an in depth understanding of US/CA/state taxes who can help formulate creative solutions.

personalfinance,Is it possible to do anything after being lied to from signing up at a gym?,"Alright, not sure where to really start... so this might be all over the place.

But here goes: I've recently found out that my gym membership expired, which was very confusing to me because what I signed up for (or thought I signed up for) was a 3 year deal for about $500. That was what the guy who first signed me up and I agreed on.

After talking with another guy today about my membership, and actually being shown the papers *that wasn't shown to me at all from the first guy*... I've found out that what I really did sign up for was only 18 months for about $600. Which wasn't a fucking deal at all (~$33 a month). I thought it was weird because about 3 months after signing up, I was billed an extra $100, and then an extra $50. Turns out, the plan that I've signed up for was supposed to be $600, and the extra $50 is an annual maintenance fee. I was told $500, no info about anything else. Luckily, I've got the $100 waived off (which I had no idea about anyways), so it ended up being around $27 a month for 1 1/2 years (excluding the annual fee).

The problem here was that I wasn't shown any bits of paper when I've signed up with the first guy. Nothing. And I understand that is where my mistake comes in. I should've asked to look at the papers, and I shouldn't have just signed so willingly. But here's the thing. I wasn't given any papers, I wasn't sent any emails, I wasn't given a receipt, and now that I was shown the papers that was supposed to be shown to me before, the initials within these documents were not written by me. I don't remember if I put my initials down for things, I might've, but on these documents, it's definitely not my writing. I know for a fact I do not write my initials like this. Not these squiggly ass letters for my names.

I know that it might be too late to do anything. Hell, it's been a year and a half. I had to figure it out otherwise the people at the front desk would just keep telling my membership expired, and of course, if I signed up for the proper one, it shouldn't be saying that.

The guy that signed me up got fired though. Probably about 3 months after I've signed up because I remembered having to ask about the ""extra fees"". Turns out this guy knew damn well what he was fucking doing. I'm not sure the exact reasons for why he's gotten fired... but I wouldn't be surprised if this is one of them.

Anyways... this time I've actually signed up for 3 years like what I originally intended... Got the paper documents, receipts, and the guy actually showing me the screen and the whole process of signing me up. Showed my membership expiration date along with information about the annual fees...

But the first guy straight up lied to me about what I was signing up for. I'm not angry or fed up over it, just a bit surprised and wondering if there's anything I can really do. I totally understand if I'm unable to do anything though. There was no way to prove that we both agreed on $500, since everything else was just written down on paper. I mean, the guy's fired and gone, and perhaps I did give him permission to sign and list down my initials, but I think the bigger concern was just me not actually physically being shown the papers and being informed of what I had to pay. I simply thought these random fees were hidden fees when they were apart of the contract.

Anyways, this was just a lesson well-learned. Shady people everywhere, you can never be too careful when it comes to making a decent payment.",finance

investing,People borrow money to start a new business others invest in the stock market with borrowed money,"Most of my friends and relatives who are wealthy got that way by taking serious risks.  They worked 16 hours a day 7 days a week using borrowed money to get a business off the ground.  Many times the business failed and they were on the hook for lots of borrowed money that did not bear fruit.

Historically the stock market is up 75% percent of the years.  And up 90% of five year periods.  Very few new small businesses that get started by an individual have such great odds.  With the stock market, if you have starting capital you are rewarded for other people's hard work and innovation.  You are investing in the ideas and efforts of people all over the world.  So far that investment has been successful for millions of people.

So, instead of investing borrowed money in your own business with a less than 50-50 chance of making a profit in the first year, why not invest your borrowed money in the stock market and play the 75% chance odds that you will come ahead in a typical year?  And earn your money passively vs through hard work?

**What got me thinking about it was an offer from my credit card.  They offered me a 1.99% interest rate on a credit card convenience check for one year with a 2% one-time fee.   I thought I would write a check for $10,000 pay the $200 fee and $200 in interest for the year.  Put it in the 60-40 Mutual Fund that has a 75-year record of profit 85% of the years and hope for the best.  I suspect the most I could lose with this investment is 20% ($2000) in a really terrible bear market, plus the $400 in fees.  While a typical one year gain will be 7% which would give me a profit of $660.00 ($700-$40 in fees and interest.)**

Ron Paul is warning negative interest rates will crush the global economy.

The former Republican congressman from Texas believes the U.S. won’t be the exception.

“We will join the rest of them and go to total negative rates in hopes that that will be the solution,” he told CNBC’s “Futures Now” on Thursday. “We’ve never had as many currencies in negative interest rates. $17 trillion worth of bonds [are] in negative interest rates. It’s never existed before. And, that’s a bubble. So, we’re in the biggest bond bubble in history, and it’s going to burst.”

Paul, a former presidential candidate and vocal libertarian known for his economic and stock market bubble warnings, contends the Federal Reserve’s policies are powerless in this environment. He doesn’t believe this week’s Fed meeting will provide any kind of relief and cutting rates will not be the answer.

“You can’t predict exactly where the creation of credit goes,” said Paul. “We have a ton of inflation with all that QE [quantitative easing]. And, every time you lower interest rates below market levels and create new credit, that’s a bubble.”

Paul has been waving the red flag for years, warning that a once in a lifetime market drop of 50% or more will strike stocks. With bonds yielding negative rates now in focus, he suggests the danger is ballooning to unseen levels.

Yet, he’s unsure of the timing of a collapse.

“You don’t know this precise time. But you know it can happen,” he said. “How do you sell a bond that pays a negative rate? Who’s going to jump up and down?”

Flashback October 2018

But what a difference a year makes.

Paul was worried about the other extreme last October — when the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield rallied to seven year highs and hit 3.26%, creating inflation jitters.

“It can be pretty well validated by looking at monetary history that when you inflate the currency, distort interest rates and live beyond your means and spend too much, there has to be an adjustment,” Paul told “Futures Now” last October. “We have the biggest bubble in the history of mankind.”

On Friday, the 10-year yield closed at 1.9%, its highest level since August 2.

So, why is Paul still warning an epic bond bubble will burst an create chaos if rates are no longer above 3%?

According to Paul, central banks which drastically lower interest rates destroy the pricing mechanism in financial markets.

“I don’t think anything even existed coming close to what we’re facing today,” Paul said.",finance

The loan company I'm going through offers the same rates on all three loan terms, but you pay fewer points/get more credits if you go with the shorter loan term. As far as I can tell, the only benefit of the shorter loan term is the slightly smaller closing costs (the 20 year loans only differ from the 30 year loans by a couple hundred dollars). Is there anything else that I'm missing? Assuming the same interest rate, if I pay the same amount monthly on both loans (with extra principal payments on the 30 year loan to make up the difference), the only difference would be the couple hundred in closing costs, correct? Am I missing any other benefits to the shorter loan terms? A couple hundred bucks seems like it's worth the payoff flexibility of the longer loan term.

My main question is, I know that the interest rates are low right now, and housing prices are high.  My original idea was to wait until the market comes down and buy when the prices are low, but I'm also hearing that if you do that, the interest rates just rise to compensate for it, and you end up in a wash anyway.  How do I figure out when is the right time to buy?

I have an emergency fund setup that would last me 6-12 months and I rotate $10k of it in 4 week T-Bills for the federal tax advantage on the interest.

My account for home renovations will be getting tapped fairly frequently (Yearly or so until I finish some short-term goals) so I am going to leave it in my High-Yield Savings with Ally. My next Vehicle savings on the other hand is currently sitting at over $3k in just \~9 months and I contribue $250-$300 on average a month to this account. I feel like I am leaving a ton of money on the table since I won't need a new vehicle for 5-10 years. I understand a 5-10 year investment account isn't a guarantee however I feel like it is long-term enough if I do a 50/50 split in a bond index and S&amp;P index fund with low fees that I'll have significantly better returns.

What is everyone's thoughts on how to handle saving for a goal 5-10 years out? If I were to switch to investing should I open a personal investment account with Fidelity where my 401k and IRA are or open an investment account with Ally where my savings is? Right now Ally has a 1.9% APY and market average on a conservative basis is 4-5%. Using a compound interest calculator we are looking at a $1000+ loss in interest potential.

I have financed $19,839 over 72 months. ~$400/mo payment. 

I make $110k/yr and only have student loan debt - my monthly nut is &lt; 30% before my car expenses.

I don't drive often, it's a 2019 Nissan Sentra and I have decent insurance rates. I have a protected garage. I want to retain value and pay off or trade in ASAP so I can try to recoup some of the loss I drove away on.... (rolled of the lot with 5 miles).

I can talk about the stupidity that brought me to this decision but I'd rather know about what the best behaviors are from here on out. 

Should I Turo my car out to pay for the loan? Should I Uber to make the payment? Should I double up payments? Should I sell now?

I can't find the right answer.

Thanks friends. Will edit post if needed.

Interest rate is around 11% because I had shit credit... dealer talked me into a new vehicle because they said I could qualify for a higher loan, even though they denied me for a pre-owned at $10k (the original car I wanted)

personalfinance,Debating refi 4.375 to 3.375 with or without rolling in fees and scholarship curveball.,"I'm having a hard time factoring in whether or how to refi our mortgage.

We are 5.5 years into our original mortgage for 276k at 4.375%.1378 monthly p&amp;i

Options are to refi or not and whether to roll in fees.

3.375% on 250k (and pay fees upfront)
1105 monthly p&amp;i for 30 year total of 397,637

3.375 on 255k (fees rolled in)
1127 monthly p&amp;i for 30 year total of 405,590

(fees are actually around 3600, this is a mortgage broker, we shopped around minimally but an online lender and Chase who has the current mortgage were the same or higher and couldn't touch this broker's rate)

So I understand the concept of dividing our 3800 in fees by 273 or 251 to see that in a little over a year we'll have saved that. But what about the extra interest in taking out a new 30 year mortgage? We were not offered the option of a 25 year mortgage, just reminded we could apply more to principal to lower overall interest paid and effectively pay off in 25 years or less....but of course we could do that with our current mortgage and effectively lower overall interest paid. 

The amount of our mandatory p&amp;i is a factor because academic scholarships we benefit from every year take into account our monthly obligations (not a personal commitment to pay down mortgage).
Taxes are insane, over 10k a year and rising. My interest in lowering the rate beyond saving overall interest is the safety net of a low minimum payment as taxes increase.

With such a low interest rate it feels like a better option to invest rather than make overpayments, which makes rolling in the fees look like a better option. And our long term goals would be to buy more property before paying off a mortgage with such a low rate.

The curve ball is we benefit from academic scholarships that take into consideration monthly obligations (like housing whether it is rent or the minimum owed on a monthly mortgage) and assets like savings, but not principal in a home. We are thankful for this help and our intentions are honest, but just like certain financial decisions can be made with tax benefits in mind, the criteria  of this scholarship effects how we address our mortgage.",finance

personalfinance,Incorrect Tax Withholdings - taxes withheld in wrong state... Witheld in CA instead of Washington D.C. W2-C issued. Help?,"Hi all - I am in need of some help.

All of my 2018 taxes were incorrectly withheld in California rather than Washington D.C. by my employer. I filed an extension back in April 2018, have since received a W2-C, and have a few questions to make sure I am handling the situation properly in time for the fast approach October 15 deadline. Seeking advice.

&amp;#x200B;

In Feb 2018, I moved to Washington D.C. and started working at a new job in Reston, VA. (I had lived in CA for Jan 2018, but did NOT work in CA in 2018 seeing as I had recently quit jobs in Sept 2017 before moving to D.C.)

**All of my 2018 taxes were originally wrongfully withheld in CA for 2018 (even though I earned $0 in CA for 2018) rather than correctly withheld to reflect my residence in Washington D.C. My original W2 depicted all state taxes going towards CA.**

I didn’t realize that my taxes were incorrectly withheld until after my company issued my W2... in April I ended up filing a federal and state extension and writing D.C. a large check to cover the taxes I estimated I owed them (plus some in case I owed late fees etc.).

After getting in touch with my HR department and explaining the situation, my company ended up issuing me a W2-C so that my tax information correctly says my state wages should be going to Washington D.C. and that $0 should be going to CA, and that’s where we're currently at.

I’ve been trying to sort this through turbo tax, but it’s not quite playing out exactly as I thought it would seeing as I have a W2-C and wrote a check to D.C when I filed for an extension.

Now I’m thinking I need to do this all through paper forms to best sort it out...

Any advice for the specific forms and/or process to sort this all out?

Everything was fine and good, but now, over two weeks later, we receive a call that our financing wasn’t approved at the interest rate that we signed for, and that we’d need to sign a new contract at a higher rate.

personalfinance,Developing a sustainable strategy for increasing your savings rate.,"tl;dr: If you want to be better at saving money, I suggest quitting budgeting/tracking your expenses, and instead taking specific actions that will lead to good, long term spending habits.

I see a lot of people here struggling to save their hard earned cash. IMO, a lot of this is the result of well-intentioned but ultimately poor advice that says one should focus on budgeting and tracking expenses diligently. I want to share my own system for saving, which focuses instead on habit creation and serves me pretty well. By sharing, I hope it might help someone out there who is struggling to save. 

For background, I’m 23yo with a $63k salary. On average I save 60% of my net ($52k) income.

First, before implementing a system for saving, you should make sure you’ve taken the one-time actions that will save you money without having to change your lifestyle. Plenty has been written elsewhere on all these things, so I won’t go into detail. Google is your best friend here.

**One-time Actions to Save**

(1) Cancel any TV subscriptions you don’t watch, or change you’re cable package so that it only has the essentials. Normally I would take a harder stance on this and tell you to cancel your cable altogether, but I promised in the above paragraph that I wouldn’t make you change your lifestyle :)

(2) Clean up your cell phone bill. Shop around for smaller providers in your area that are more affordable than the big, well established ones. Or, have a look at your current bill and make sure you aren’t paying for services that you’re not using.

(3) Negotiate your salary. (Okay, so this isn’t strictly a savings tactic, but it can certainly raise your bottom line with minimal time invested).

(4) Many others that are particular to your own life.

**And if you’re in debt:**

(5) Call your credit card company and negotiate a lower interest rate.

(6) If you have a student loan, look into setting up automatic repayments. Some offer a small rate reduction for doing so.

(7) If you have multiple student loans, look into consolidating them to pay less overall in interest.

**Developing the Saving Habit**

Now that you’ve taken care of the one-offs, you’re in a good spot to start focusing on creating long-term habits for saving. At this point, you might want to set a goal like: “I want to save X dollars per month,” or create a budget that is inflexible and restrictive in all kinds of ways. You already know that your goal is to save as much money as possible, so there’s no point in doing this. You want to save your money. Good. Now focus on the specific actions that will get you there:

(1) Review your expenses from the last few months. Note any recurring expenses that are not essential which you could conceivably cut out. For me, some of these expenses include:

* Meals (eating out).
* Coffee
* Snacks
* Books
* Transportation (when I could really be walking).

(2) Take the expenses you’ve identified, and identify the ones you are willing to live without. The more the better. Note these in some kind of journal or note pad on your phone, ideally one that also has a calendar.

(3) Now stop looking at your expenses. Sign out of your online banking or file your bank statement away. You don’t need to be looking at them. Stop.

(4) Take the expenses you identified in (2) and resolve not to purchase them anymore (or infrequently) by doing the following:

* For smaller ticket items (coffee, snacks, public transport): When you get an impulse to purchase them, don’t do it. Every time you succeed in doing so, write the item and $ amount down in your easy-to-access journal. At the end of each day, week, month, or year, tally all these savings up and transfer the total into your savings account. Congratulations, this is money that you would not otherwise have had, and you’ve just rewarded this good behaviour each time you write the saving down, or make the transfer to your savings account.
* For larger items (books, clothes, toys, etc.): When you desire a purchase, don’t do it. Unless it’s absolutely necessary, write the name of the item down in your journal/calendar one month later than the current date. At that day, you will be reminded of the item and can then judge whether you still want/“need” the item, or whether your desire to purchase it was impulse. If you still think you really need it, knock yourself out. If you don’t buy it, record it in your savings log as in the previous bullet point.

(5) Stop looking at your bank statement. Seriously, don’t obsess over your expenses. By taking the actions in (4), you’ll be exercising impulse control and rewarding good spending behaviours, both of which will come more easily to you as you continue to do them. When you look at your bank statement, you only allow yourself to see the expenses, the negative side of the picture for any keen penny pincher. You don’t see all those hard earned dollar bills that you’ve saved. In the longer term, frequent observation of your transactions turns into a negative association with your personal finances as opposed to a positive one that pats you on the back for your good work.

(One note here: please continue to poke around your account infrequently to make sure you’re in a good financial position and there aren’t any unexpected or fraudulent charges. The point is to stop obsessing over your finances, not to avoid all safety precautions.)

I could go on and on about the many reasons I think this strategy trumps the traditional “set a budget and track your progress” advice. I want this post to be as practical as possible, so I won’t go into any detail about these reasons, but in general it’s far more effective to take actions that reward good spending habits than to fixate on the negative outcomes. Your relationship with your personal finances should feel more like the one a (good) pet owner has with their pet and less like a nurse trying to shove pills down your throat.",finance

personalfinance,Which Credit Card Should I Pay Off First?,"Hi all,

Long story short, I've made a series of bad decisions (bad spending habits, loaning someone a lot of money, and not having enough income to support myself). I'm 19, have had a credit score (though not long credit history, of course) of about 726 at it's highest, and it's now sitting in the 610 range. Which, I promised myself I wouldn't have bad credit lol.

Anyway, I've quickly realized my horrible mistakes and know that I am going to need a good credit score. I have four cards that are maxed out. 

The lowest (and least concerning to me) is my Google Store card. It has a balance of about $1000, which has a normal interest rate of 29.99%, but I have special financing at 0% for 24 months, and would not be charged any interest at all even if I make only the minimum payments until it is paid off.

The second lowest is my Amazon card, which I spend some monthly on (maybe $50) and I use for my hygiene and hair care products. It has a balance of about $1400 and has an APR of 28.24%.

The second highest is my Capital One Platinum, which has a balance of about $2550, $50 over the limit and has an APR of 25.99%.

The highest is my PayPal, mostly because they let me keep increasing my limit through cash advances, and my series of bad decisions. It has a balance of about $5770, $170 over the limit and an APR of 26.24%.

So, the way I see it, I have two options for eliminating the debt.

Option 1, and the one I think would be smartest in terms of interest, is by making the minimum payment on each card, except for PayPal, which I would put every bit of money I could into. And then work my way down in terms of which one has the highest balance, with the Google Store card last due to its lack of interest.

Option 2, make the minimum payment on each card, except for Amazon, which I would put every bit of money I could into. And work my way up going from the lowest balance card to the highest. This would let me put the minimum payment of each card (after I pay each off) and tack that onto the payment of the next card. Though, still leaving the Google Store card last due to its lack of interest.

Personally, I think I'm going to do option one, making $500 payments to PayPal until it is paid off (and using an online calculator, it would still take 14 months to pay off...). Though, of course I'm posting this for advice, so please feel free! Thank you for taking the time to read this!",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,Savings account. Don’t know what one for long term savings.,"Okay so I am starting a new job next week and just needing to provide a bank account. 


So what I wanna do is have a $100 float in my everyday transaction account and then $200 per week into an expense account so that everything there can be auto debited and then my savings account which is everything after everything else. 
All accounts have $0 fees 



Okay so I’m doing this online and would rather have the accounts with the same bank for convenience. I know if I look around there will be better banks for this but I don’t care. 



option A. Everyday banking account without impacting interest rate. Earn bonus interest for the first four months. 0.11% variable plus 2.00% bonus. 
Then I’m assuming it goes back to 0.11%



Option B: 0.11% variable rate plus 1.75% WITH one deposit before 2nd last banking day of the month and no withdrawals. If there’s a withdrawal I’ll still get the 0.11% for the month. 



Now Personally I believe Option B would be better for long term such as saving up for a car and all of that. And option A for my auto debit account. And a normal everyday account for my $100 float like food and all that.


Edit: I am Australian and our Superannuation ( our version of 401k ) is given to us by our employer. So nothing will be added to that might at a later date.",finance
personalfinance,"23 y/o college student looking to move out with a friend. Is it even doable, and how do I figure out how much I can reasonably afford?","I am a junior in college currently, and I live at home, go to school full time, and work part time (around 20 hrs a week during the semester, 11.50/hr with a scheduled .25 raise coming up in a couple months). i don’t *love* living with my parents, but it works out fairly well and I don’t pay rent and I’m allowed to have my cat here so I can’t complain.

My friend’s home life has recently taken a turn for the worse. Her father is very hostile and controlling, more than usual, and he has been physically abusive in the past, so she is looking to get out ASAP. She works full time for $12 an hour.  Her options for renting on her own are very limited, and I’ve wanted to move out but couldn’t afford to live on my own and didn’t think it was worth the hassle and risk of trying to find a roommate, so I told her if it helps her expand her search I would be willing to rent a 2br with her. 

There is a 2 bedroom that allows pets and would be an ideal location for both of us but it is I believe $965 a month. If we were to divide rent evenly it would be about $100 over 1/3 of my monthly income, but all utilities except electric are included. At this point my only major monthly expense is my car payment which is $193. I do need a few thousand in savings at any given time to pay for tuition not covered by fafsa/scholarships, but I also have low debt right now, I think I still have less than $10k in federal loans which I think is pretty good. I don’t keep a formal budget currently but I’m good at putting money away in my savings and leaving it there, and don’t spend much money on going out or buying clothes or anything. I am also still on my parents health insurance and my mother is paying for my car insurance while I am in school. 

Would renting this apartment sound feasible? I’m going to talk with my parents and see their opinion as well before committing to anything. But in addition to helping my friend out I’d really love to finally have my own place.",finance

personalfinance,Bank loan for repaying student loan? (UK),"My first post in r/personalfinance as I have just graduated uni and starting my career as an engineer next week and would like to finally start really getting on top of my finance. 

As per, I have accrued some £38k in student loans (4 year uni + interest). I was rather unpleasantly surprised that the student loan has annual interest in excess of 6% (guess I should've known that before but better late than never right?).

Since engineering usually pays more than the average, I expect to be paying off the student loan in full at some point. However, the 6%+ interest makes me want to pay that back as quick as possible as currently I am losing over £2k in interest annually. 
Hence I was thinking perhaps it is better to somehow get a bank loan with lower annual interest rate to pay off the student loan with a lump sum.

I am wondering if my chain of thought is correct? With a bank loan I have the disadvantage that I will definitely have to pay back each month whereas at my current salary I don't pay anything towards my student loan for at least next 6 month (first performance review). I have been planning to make voluntary payments to pay off the student loan anyway so I feel like going with a bank loan would make sense. Also, I've never taken a loan from a bank, is there even a way to get a loan for this occasion? Any advice welcome!",finance

personalfinance,Should I defer my private student loans?,"I recently consolidated 3 private student loans, with variable interest rates as high as 10.5%, into one loan at 6.43%. This has helped to drop my monthly payments considerably from ~$800 to $465 and allowed me much more flexibility for my short/long-term planning, however I still have the option to defer for the next 3 months while I am completing my Master's degree. Once I finish my degree, there's a decent chance that I may have to take a slight pay cut in order to find an entry-level job in my field as I've been working full-time in an unrelated field for the past 3 years ($46,000 to $40,000). 

I have a fair number of expenses upcoming in the next 6 months related to wedding/bachelor party plans (2 bachelor parties and 3 weddings that will require travel/lodging expenses for which I'm planning to save ~$2,500). I currently have $1,300 saved away for these purposes.

I will also need to buy a used car in the next 6 months as my old pick-up has around 280,000 miles and will likely need significant repairs just about any day now. I have done some searching and am keeping my budget below $11,000 with monthly payments around $200 and insurance around $150. I currently have $1,000 set aside for a down payment and hope to add to this number in the next few months.

Current monthly take home pay: **$2,900**

Average monthly living expenses: **$2,000**

Current emergency fund: **$3,000**

Travel fund: **$1,300** of $2,500 goal

Car payment: **$1,000** of $1,500 goal

My question is, would it be worth it to take the hit from 3 months of interest in order to more aggressively build up my savings accounts in order to prepare for these anticipated expenses and a potential pay cut? I'm also considering making interest only payments while the loan is in deferment to keep the monthly payments from ballooning.

EDIT: The total loan is **$47,000**",finance

personalfinance,Would another Credit Card help my situation?,"I’ve been trying to raise my credit score, so that when the time comes to buy a house, or whatever the case maybe, I’d like to be considered credit worthy for good rates and whatnot. 

My current score (according to mint) is 644. I have one credit card currently, that I’ve never missed a payment, or carried a balance on, as well as a car loan, which I’m actually a bit ahead of, payment wise. I used to have a secured credit card, but once I got the unsecured credit card, I never used the secured card, so I cancelled it. Looking back, I DEFINITELY shouldn’t have cancelled it, just due to my age of credit. 

I previously had a car loan that had a VERY high interest rate, in the ballpark of 17% due to my lack of credit history, and recently refinanced it through my bank to a (admittedly still high) 6.99% interest rate. 

My major issue with why my credit score is so low, is that I have two derogatory marks on my credit history, due to my mother. When I was about 18, she had me sign my name to the cable account, and for a rental instrument for my little sister. My mom told me that she was going to pay these bills, and if she couldn’t pay for it, she’d tell me so I could help out, since I was living with her rent free. I didn’t think that was too bad at the time, so I went ahead and signed for it. 

Then, she unfortunately passed away about 3, almost 4 years ago. I never put any thought towards my credit or whatever debt might’ve ended up in my name, until I tried getting a car about a year ago, since they obviously pulled my credit report and I discovered that they are affecting my score. 

Here’s the entire point of the title of this post; when I pay off those debts (that I’ve currently never made a payment on) I assume those will count against me as a late payment and then ruin my current, 100% on-time payment rate. If I were to pay them both off, according to my calculations, that 100% would drop to about 97.3%, which (again, according to Mint) would be in the “poor” range. I assume that’d also wreck my credit score. 

Would it make sense to get another credit card to have more payments made, to make the impact of the late payments, a bit lighter? Or, am I just overthinking this whole thing entirely, and should I just pay them off, and deal with the lowered credit age and on-time payment rate for now?",finance

personalfinance,20 Y/O in a pickle,"Hello r/personalfinance,

This is my first post on this subreddit so hello everyone! Let me explain my situation real quickly.

I am a college student at my local community college, transferring to a university in Philadelphia next year, I do not have any student loans as I received grants to go to college due to my families income. As we all know cold weather is quickly approaching here in Pennsylvania and my only vehicle is a 2017 Suzuki V-strom 650 Motorcycle, my truck that I had paid in full and in my name recently bit the dust and I had it sent to the scrap yard from rust damage. I am in need of a car and I came on here to get opinions on what I should do. I found a very nice used Hyundai Sonata at my local used car dealership and I talked them down to $4,125 out-the-door price if I choose to buy it.

The issue however is that I am very weary of getting another loan, here is a rundown of my financial situation.

LIABILITIES;

\~$6,000 loan for my motorcycle; Payment- $121.14 / Mo. | Insurance- $56.56 / Mo.

I just paid off my credit card of \~$600 so that is out of the way for now, 

ASSETS;

I have about $800 in cash right now

Since I was 18 I have been building my credit so I have a fairly nice 730 credit score right now, never missed any payments on anything.

JOB;

I have 2 jobs,

I am a federal work study student at my college, paid bi weekly \~$190

My second job however is the real money maker, I am a photographer at a studio and can earn anywhere between $70-$200 a day depending on what we are doing, however my schedule fluctuates drastically. Typically I can work this job about 1-3 times a week, but it is honestly being bottlenecked by me working at my first job. I know I need to get another job that pays more but I also dont want to lose my school job because I am able to sit here and do my homework and I sort of have a upper hand on alot of things because I know all the faculty and they treat me as one of them in a sense.

personalfinance,HELOC in addition to refinance? Which first? Other options?,"Sorry, this is a throw-away account because I'm embarrassed to be in this situation.

Last month I started looking into refinancing, since interest rates are much lower than when I purchased my home two-and-a-half years ago. It's a drop from 4.5% on a 30-year, to 3.5% for a 20-year, or 3.625% for a 30-year.

We had two unexpected home repairs. One was a month or so ago, and zapped some savings. It was about $5900.

We have another now that will be about $7900. I've got $750 in savings. This new one will need to go on a credit card. I could probably pay it off in a few months. I use this card as a debit and pay the balance off every month and get the points, so I normally never pay interest on it. My credit score is great, in the 860's. Other than the mortgage, which is about $198,000 on a $260,000 value house, and a $20,000 auto loan, I am debt free. Our monthly expenses allow us to save about $1500 a month, which goes into an interest bearing savings account.

My other half has about $18,000 in credit card debt. He's started on baby steps and started chipping away.

I'm considering some type of consolidation of his debt, and the new debt that will be incurred from the home repair. We also have the ability to aggressively repay that debt, likely within two or three years.

I'm considering a HELOC to get rid of the higher interest loans my other half has, and the newly incurred debt of about $6800 for the home repair. The payments he was making to all of those cards, would be used to pay down the HELOC as soon as possible.

I'm really seeking advice as to the best options.",finance

Student loans in her field (public health) come at a very high interest rates, generally over 7%.

personalfinance,I never paid my taxes and am now having my wages garnished by the IRS.,"First time poster, and am in need of some major guidance. As the title suggests, I failed to file my taxes this past season, happen to owe the IRS quite a bit of money, and don't know where to start. I'm in my 20's, work as a server, and could use some help.

I'm not going to dive too deep into the reason this all happened, but here's a quick recap of whats going on. About a year ago I began dealing with some mental health issues, and couldn't bring myself to keep up with the amount of work needed to pay bills. My fix to that problem was making a change through payroll to become \*federally tax exempt\*, which obviously created larger paychecks, allowing me to work less and less, yet still keep up with monthly bills. I know, this was a terrible decision, but I honestly didn't care at all at the time, due to my mental health status.

I began working towards a healthier daily life, but kept this situation on the back-burner until last week, when the IRS finally bit back. I saw that a large amount of money, nearly emptying my checking and savings account, had been withdrawn for ""legal action"" from my BOA accounts. I moved some time ago, but never changed my mailing address, allowing me to continue to avoid problems such as this. My guess is that I've received letters from the IRS since, which they've gotten no response, causing them to begin garnishing my wages. 

So now, I've began trying to fix this on my own, but have ran into some difficulties. I made an account on the IRS's website to set up a payment plan, but I need to know what I owe first, which I have no idea. I've called multiple numbers given by their website, but feel like I've been running in circles. I'm starting to feel discouraged, but know that I HAVE to get this fixed.

\- Do I need to file these back taxes before beginning anything else?

\- If not, who should I be calling within the IRS for help?

\- Would I be better off consulting with a private company for help?",finance
investing,How does the fed “inject” money into the economy?,"I’ve tried Googling this but can’t come up with a satisfactory answer. Most articles I’ve read simply say “large banks buy money from the Federal Reserve’s banks”. But how does a private bank *buy* money?

Hypothetically, let’s say I own a bank. People have stored $10 billion in my bank. I invest their money in the market, loan it out to others, etc. as my business.

I want more money, so I can make bigger loans. How do I purchase more money with money? How can I purchase money at all? Wouldn’t I just be trading a dollar for a new dollar? Or does the fed subsidize private banks by giving them money at a discount? In which case, how do I get in on that racket?

Thanks.",finance

Bitcoin,53 Bullish Reasons,"Credit for this list goes to Murad Mahmudov

1. Global trust in government institutions, banks, and mass media companies is at multi-decade lows.
2. Studies show that trust between people (interpersonal trust) is eroding and is near all-time lows, too.
3. Trust between nations is diminishing, too.
4. Global debt levels are at all-time highs, and up 50% up since the global financial crisis of 2008.
5. If you add unfunded liabilities, and other ""off-the-books"" government obligations (social security, healthcare obligations, etc.) to the debt number, the picture is even worse.
6. USD 15 trillion in negative-yielding debt around the world.
7. Meantime, global central banks are in rate-cutting frenzy at the moment, as negative rates are going deeper into the negative zone.
8. Normalization of Modern Monetary Theory and other economic schools of thought advocating for ""unorthodox"" monetary policy.
9. Wealth inequality in the English-speaking world is at 100-year highs, and near multi-decade highs in other countries and a growing number of people are realizing that fiat money, central banking, and easy monetary policies may have had something to do with it.
10. Wealth and income inequality is one of the factors fueling the rise of populist leaders and politicians around the globe, both on the right and the left.
11. Populist and radical politicians are more likely to both sharply increase and reduce taxation, engage in aggressive monetary policies or confiscating assets, and bitcoin gives the 1% an asset that is far more resilient to seizure by the 99%.
12. Central banks' demand for gold is at multidecade highs
13. While still the biggest share, the dollar's share of global currency reserve is slowly declining.
14. The era of bank secrecy is coming to an end as Switzerland and other traditional private banking havens start sharing account data with tax authorities of dozens of other countries.
15. Mass-surveillance, both financial and non-financial, is on the rapid rise.
16. Attempts to ban the usage of cash are on the rise.
17. Sanctions and weaponization of large international settlement networks around the world.
18. Bitcoin is slowly starting to be increasingly frequently mentioned next to the term ""safe haven."" (However, Mahmudov believes it still will take some time until Bitcoin becomes a real safe haven).
19. Demographics. The non-tech savvy older generations are gradually passing while the tech-savvy younger generations become adults.  
20. Internet penetration continues to grow steadily around the world.
21. Smartphone penetration continues to grow globally.
22. The proportion of time that people are spending online continues to grow.
23. Continued financialization of Bitcoin, as slowly and steadily, bitcoin is starting to appeal to traditional investors.
24. Bitcoin core and layer 1 improvements are steadily improving regardless of the bitcoin price action.
25. The development of various Bitcoin layer 2 technologies continues.
26. Numerous Lightning Network improvements and features are in the works (Submarine Swaps, Atomic Swaps, Dual-funded channels, Sphinx, Neutrino, Eltoo, etc.).
27. The entire ecosystem of Lightning-related infrastructure, products, and services are expanding.
28. Bitcoin hash rate, or the computing power of the network, has hit new all-time highs last week.
29. The Bitcoin hash rate distribution is improving.
30. Existing Bitcoin privacy solutions are being improved and new solutions are being developed.
31. Bitcoin custody solution improvements.
32. The growing number of non-monetary Bitcoin use-cases.
33. More and more people are simply coming to the realization that Bitcoin is superior to previous money products across the majority of dimensions.
34. Bitcoin infrastructure and everything around it is growing very rapidly.
35. Bitcoin memes are growing strong.
36. More stores accepting bitcoin as payment.
37. Growth in Bitcoin literature.
38. Growth in Bitcoin educational courses.
39. The rising number of Bitcoin-only entrepreneurs and businesses.
40. More and more traditional finance and global macro people are slowly joining in recommending BTC as a part of one's portfolio.
41. Bitcoin stock-to-flow ratio. Since bitcoins are going to be increasingly more difficult to produce, their limited supply and growing demand are meant to produce higher price valuation.
42. Global bitcoin penetration in terms of capital still remains small relative to the total addressable market. Bitcoin is still super young, especially in terms of the percentage of the global monetary base.
43. Superior Bitcoin Sharpe ratio. Bitcoin has been giving a significantly higher risk-adjusted return compared with other major asset classes.  
44. Uncorrelated nature. Bitcoin is extremely uncorrelated to other asset classes.
45. Better than any remittance solution, especially when it comes to international transfers to sanctioned or other disadvantaged regions.
46. Destruction of the ICOs and altcoins. It's much better for the newcomers in the space when they can choose from fewer digital assets as they enter the crypto market.
47. A steady reduction in Bitcoin volatility, as it is one of the most important things if bitcoins are to be treated as money.
48. Onchain metrics: dormancy. On-chain analytics show that large BTC holders aren't selling their holdings nor moving their coins despite the price movements.
49. The number of addresses holding 1, 0.1 or 0.01 BTC are steadily growing.
50. BTC realized price just reached all-time highs last month and continues to have a very sharp upward momentum.
51. Log-log analysis which uses logarithmic price and logarithmic time shows that bitcoin price will keep on growing, albeit at a slower rate but with less volatility.
52. Bitcoin price has had higher monthly price lows every month this year, except for February, and this trend is likely to continue in the future.
53. Bitcoin's self-reinforcing effects. Bitcoin's design contains many loops that are feeding it to make it increasingly stronger.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Public service loan forgiveness,"Hello all, 

I want to ask the internet community as if this is a good decision. I am in the public service sector and make about $95k with only $58k that is taxable. I am single and on a REPAYE timeline for my federal unsubsidized loan of about $70k at $5.75%. If I utilize the PSLF it would equal only $45k in 120 payments.

My financial status is $32k in Roth IRA, $44k in Vanguard ETFs, and $10k in Roth tsp.

As this is my first year in the government, I plan on contributing $19k/yr into the govt 401k and $6k/yr into a Roth Ira.

My question is would it be better to continue with my current plan of doing the PSLF on the REPAYE plan and contributing to a 401k and IRA? Or should I forget the PSLF and attempt to pay back my student loans sooner by liquidating my Vanguard funds and put the $25k i would have placed in 401k + ira towards the loan?",finance
personalfinance,Calculating interest given only the dollar amounts involved?,"Hi,

I recently got a letter from my state revenue department saying I messed up my tax return for 2015. It said the amount owed was $730.00, and I also now must pay $191.51 in interest on that amount.

I am kind of astounded that the value could be so high, so I'd like to calculate what interest rate the equates to.

If we take the start of the period as April 15, 2016 and the date of the notification letter as the end (Sept. 4, 2019), that's 1,237 days or 3.38 years.

If I google on calculators to estimate interest rates, they only talk about generalized periods and rates ... I can't find any where you ""back calculate"" based on the actual values involved, while plugging in a time period.

Can anyone help here? I will dust off the old exponential equations if no one can help. But I'd rather find a calculator I can use, laugh.

I guess I'm looking for the APR (annualized percentage rate).

personalfinance,"(US) 25, car payment, student loan payments, I need to reevaluate myself because I'm making no progress","I'm nearly 25 and I've dug myself a hole, and I know I'm going to be going at this for a while. I graduated college in an engineering field 3 years ago, and have made a marginal dent in my student loans but they're still pretty significant. I live at home with my parents and make $200 rent payment each month.


I have a job in an engineering office, I make $55,000± a year before taxes. The pay seems decent for the area I'm in. The job is stable, I can work unrestricted overtime but after 8 hours I often get really drained out and have had enough of sitting in an office. If I get the chance to go in the field, I try to make the most of it by working at-least an extra bit to try to get some OT when I can but its always minimal and doesn't amount to much.


I've also made some other dumb mistakes. I got into a certified pre owned truck payment on a Silverado in 2017, I've paid about $10k on the truck and owe $23,000± on and the truck currently KBB's for $26.5±k. I thought in the long run I think the truck would be worth it as I've taken investment in getting it oil undercoated to preserve it (I live in a snow state where salt is used). I have two sets of tires and rims too because its cheaper and easier for me to rotate my own tires.


I also have a motorcycle that I'm trying to sell. I think that because its getting towards winter its not going to sell. But likely will sell in the spring time, I can get $5k on the motorcycle for certain.


I have pretty significant student loan debt, but I'd say I've done about $30k worth of damage to them. I can see progress, but its slow. I have refinanced the private loans to get a lower interest rate, currently 

Student Loans

$64,230 - Private @ 6.84% interest

$21,180 - Federal @ 3.15-6.55% interest (most @ 4.41% interest)



Each month this is what I currently spend each month

$1000 on private student loans [$880 minimum payment]

$291 on federal student loans [$291 minimum payment]

$45 Phone

$15 Spotify

$220± Gas (some months its $150, some it can be $250)

$35 Motorcycle Insurance (Liability)

$80 Truck insurance (Full coverage) [$481 in 6 month blocks]

$505 truck payment

$200 Rent

$200 food

Whatever is left I try to save, sometimes I buy stupid shit so some months I don't end up saving anything.


That being said, I have $10k saved in my saving account. I also have a Health Savings account which currently has $7.5K in it. I am getting some dental work done. This can all be covered by the HSA and the HSA money can only be used for medical related expenses like doctor/dentist visits.


Credit score is great, 730-750 last I knew. I've never missed a payment, I'm just not making much progress.


Not sure if this is important, but can't hurt. I have no dependents, I'm single, and I don't foresee myself having kids anytime soon (right now I don't think I'll ever want kids, but that I could be convinced if I ever found the right person, but I'm not going to seek somebody out just have them). I also don't have a time restriction to move out, only my sanity which is really growing thin because I feel like I'm the only one I know still living at home.


Please don't berate me over my mistakes, I know I made mistakes but I want to get past that and just get to the best way to stabilize myself and try to get out of here someday.


What I think I should do is sell my motorcycle and use that money to get a truck (I need a truck). The biggest problem I'm going to have is finding something that is not a rust bucket. This state is getting worse on cracking down on rusty and vehicles with check engine lights. Sell my truck to get rid of that monthly payment. I'm at a point where I feel $10k is enough of a safety net and I should start dumping everything on my private student loan.

economy,what happens if the federal reserve cuts interest rates?,"is the interest rate that Trump's always complaining about the federal funds rate? is that a number that's just set or do they buy/sell securities in order to alter that number?

I assume that the Fed has been buying and selling government bonds since its conception, so is quantitative easing just buying on a greater scale? Are they buying different kinds of government bonds (longer term maybe)?

Large banking institutions face the risk of failure if interest rates in Europe continue to stay negative, Simon Baptist, global chief economist of the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC.

European banks have struggled for years in a persistently low interest rate environment. Low interest rates hurt lenders' profits as they narrow the margin that banks can earn.

""If interest rates stay below zero, they're certainly not all going to be able to be profitable, running as they are today, in 10 years time,"" Baptist said.

""There's either going to have to be consolidation ... maybe some bank failures, or some really radical changes in business models,"" he added.",finance

Problem is, it cost me a ton to get where I am. I am turning 34 this year and have very little in the way of retirement. I have student loans just over $500k with a rate of about 6.4% interest all through the federal loan services.

I want to make sure I pump my retirement heavily. But I also want to be free of this debt as quickly as possible. I could do the loan repayment programs like REPAYE or PAYE (currently enrolled in REPAYE while in residency) but these programs make the debt last for 20-25 years and then I will need to pay taxes on whatever is forgiven. That’s a lot! 

I simply don’t trust the PSLF program enough to put my eggs in that basket. 

The traditional 10yr payment plan is doable, but even still id like to be out from under that more quickly.

personalfinance,War On Pay Secrecy - Need Advice,"I don’t know if this would be the right place to put this, but I’ve been stressing out about this situation for the past couple days and I’m hoping someone out there knows enough to guide me a bit through the rough spots.

So I’ve done my fair share of research on the Labor Relations Act of 1935, which states that employees are legally allowed to disclose their personal salary to other coworkers whether it be at or outside of work. It’s a federal law meant to protect employees from employers that are actively trying to rip off their workers by keeping them in the dark about their going-rate for their position. This law cannot be overwritten by any corporate policy or signed contract, meaning that even if an employee signs the right away, it wouldn’t hold up in a court of law.

Last week, we had two new contractors added to my department and their starting salary is 4K a year more than what I was just raised two a few weeks ago. Granted, I’ve only been working with this company for about 6 or 7 weeks, but they don’t have any other specific experience or qualifications more than I do and we share the exact same workload and responsibilities. I brought this up to my employer (contract recruiter) and asked if there was a way to increase my title and earning wages given that I was at the bottom of my department. I got an email back saying they were “disappointed” that I was sharing my pay rate with other contractors when I signed a contract saying it was strictly confidential. Like I said, I did the research; it’s an illegal policy and would never hold up.

At the end, they added, “that being said, you must speak with the (company paying for contract) employees as they are the ones who set the titles and ask how you can take on more responsibility. So I brought it up to my supervisor that I wanted to discuss pay rates and titles with him. Instead of replying, he went to every other contractor and asked who’d been talking about their pay rates, then continuing to tell them “you shouldn’t be talking about your pay” (again, so illegal).

I fully expect this to come to a head in a meeting where they get all the contractors together and state, “from here on out, no one will talk about their pay.” To which, I’m fully prepared to rebut.

My question is, in the event that I might be given the opportunity to discuss my pay rate (in the event they don’t fire me and I file a complaint with the department of labor), what do I settle for? What happens if they tell me they are unwilling to increase my wages? Do I ask for less responsibility? If they are, again, unwilling to give me less responsibility, do I threaten to walk away? Where’s my leverage and how can I use it to the best of my ability?

Looking for any/all input from those versed in the world of solar power. Moreover, looking for suggestions or novel ideas that might get me closer to where I want to be. Have not yet heard back from Tesla. Appreciate any guidance!

&amp;#x200B;

What I wrote in the other post (to save you all from clicking on the above link):

&amp;#x200B;

*Heads up - IANAE, nor do I comprehend much more than the extreme basics about the world of electricity - to include how solar panel installations work. Bit of a read, please bear with me and my ignorance!*

*My wife and I just bought a condo/townhome in Orange County, and as we're rather environmentally-inclined, we thought it'd be great to get solar panels installed at some point - we've got a Model 3, electrical appliances, eco-friendly cleaning/hygiene supplies, and now a heat pump with air blower versus a gas-fed furnace. Eventually, we'll replace our remaining ICE vehicle with an EV, and one day replace our water-heater with an electrical one.*

*Fast-forward to the Tesla solar rental announcement - we thought that was an awesome, accessible way (read: we spent too much on renovations and can't afford an outright purchase ATM) to get solar power, with net metering through SCE.*

*I did plenty of research, read some other accounts of the rental systems, then called up Tesla and asked a litany of questions, and got excited - ended up reserving a medium-sized system order. Upon their request, I sent Tesla a list of HOA requirements before having any installation approved (basic solar site survey results, explanation of how to connect the system to service meter, assumption of liability for damages, etc.).*

*We are lawyers, so we did our homework with the Solar Rights Act and recent addendums - thankfully the HOA did not fight us, and has seemed fairly accommodating. After some days of hearing nothing, I followed-up with Tesla.*

*Much to my surprise, it was Tesla, not the HOA, which delivered some unfortunate news - they stated:*

&gt;*Unfortunately your project has been disqualified for solar installation by our design/engineering team, as we would need to place equipment on your neighbors home due to location of electrical main panel and meter. My apologies for any inconvenience this might have caused.*

*I expressed surprise, referenced a Solar Rights Act allowance of installation of solar system hardware on common areas (I contested the notion that the service meter was on some other condo unit owner's property). Followed this up with pictures showing the service meters to be in an attached shed adjacent to someone else's property, and even confirmed with our HOA that this was considered a ""common area"" and not the property of any owner. I also mentioned to Tesla that the HOA seems to even be implicitly assuming that such an installation would occur since they'd asked for how the solar panel system will be connected to the service meter.*

*My Tesla Advisor's response was to forward this all to the design team and they followed it up asking to get a picture of the circuit breaker box in our garage - I optimistically complied.*

*A bit later, they followed up with the following:*

&gt;*If we cannot install all of our equipment on the customer’s property only, the project would be a DQ. The only way an exception to this policy could be requested would be if the customer was moving forward with a Cash agreement and if Tesla’s Legal team reviewed and provided their approval. Solar access laws do not give homeowners permission to install equipment on other homeowners’ properties (customer indicated they thought solar access laws would help in this situation.) Please let me know if they’d like to proceed with purchasing the system and I will submit to the Tesla Legal team for review.If we can install in a manner that does not require us to place equipment on a neighbor’s home or common area, this can proceed normally with HOA written approval + Solar PV System Ownership Acknowledgement form signed/notarized by HOA.*

*I found this e-mail a bit confusing on several fronts, so I more or less 1) reiterated my previous comments and how such a policy would automatically disqualify any condo/townhome/MDU without individual service meters per unit, 2) emphasized that the service meter is on a common area, 3) asked what was meant by ""cash agreement"" (and suggested that if they meant purchase, we wouldn't be interested, but would be happy to take on the ""normal"" liabilities assumed by a purchaser, while keeping a rental order in place, and 4) asked if this was all a moot point, as if the entire system could be installed (directly into our garage circuit breaker panel?) then that would be great. Concluded with how we're extremely interested in having a solar system setup, and are open to ideas.*

*My Tesla Advisor responded saying he'd forward this all to the design team. I have not heard anything since (but do expect to hear something today). This seems more like a policy choice on Tesla's end (regarding the main service meter and the common area installation) and not a legal one (ironic to see companies/tech slower than the law, for once). So this brings several questions to mind, and the point of this post:*

* *Likelihood that Tesla will find some magic to make it work?*
* *Recommendations for suggestions to Tesla to make it work?*
* *If no luck with Tesla, any alternative company suggestions for renting/leasing a solar panel system? While it would be great to reduce our electrical bill, we're also just wanting to do our part in utilizing alternative energy sources where possible.*
* *Any other thoughts or suggestions or enlightenment as to my own confusions?*

personalfinance,Credit debt lowering credit score,"I’ve been out of work for almost a year, due to a medical issue that is now resolved. I’ve finally found a new job and I start on Monday. 

My husband makes a decent wage, but that just covers our bills, none of the incidentals of life with two kids. For the past year, I’ve been wracking up credit card debt to the tune of over 30k and depleting savings at the same time. We’re basically maxed on all the credit cards and out of savings, which is dragging down our credit scores, like someone filled them with concrete. We are home owners but only for about 9 years, so we don’t have that kind of equity built up yet. There is also a car loan. 

The interest rates on 2 of the cards is high, 22% and 25%. The third card, and lowest balance, is still an introductory rate of 0% but only for a few more months. 

My plan is to put most of my new checks into paying off those cards and also a small amount into savings, because we need a safety net. I’m planning to use the debt snowball and pay off the cards one at a time and then use that amount to pay the next and so forth, until they’re all gone. Today, I was looking for some kind of a consolidation loan and I got turned down for two, because my credit usage is too high and my score too low. 

So, the big question after all that is does anyone have suggestions for anywhere that would work with me to get something that would reduce that interest? I don’t even need zero, I’d be real happy in the low teens, because anything is better than what I’ve got. 

TLDR: That feeling when your credit score is low because you have too much credit card debt, but no one will let you have a lower rate loan so you can actually pay off the debt to raise your score",finance

personalfinance,Could use some advice regarding my current job situation.,"To keep things short, I work for a company that sells products to customers in-store. I make minimum wage (roughly $280 a week), with a nice little chunk of comission attached (roughly 90 paid bi-weekly). I am essentially working full time hours, although technically I'm a part time employee, because they keep me right at 39 hours.

Now, I'm married, but my wife is disabled and cannot work. And so far, I've been able to pay the bills because this job has me traveling around my region to assist at stores where they are understaffed. With this comes a good chunk of travel pay, basically an extra $138 (or more depending on the distance traveled) each day I travel. 

Lately however, the travel pay hasn't been being paid out to me in a timely fashion. It usually takes just a week to process and gets paid out on the next week's paycheck. Following some internal restructuring, I'm now having weeks where I'll have filed it a week in advance, but the pay won't process in the timely fashion I've come to expect and budget around.

This job has me traveling two hours to and from job sites on travel days, and I'm at my wit's end. We're essentially living paycheck-to-paycheck now. I have no savings, we needed to divert the money we were starting to build up there into paying our bills. 

I don't want to leave us in the lurch by quitting this job, but at the same time, we can't live on just minimum wage and the hours and travel prevents me from having the time I need to find something new. It doesnt help that the area I live in doesnt have the greatest job market, finding a job that pays what I need it to will likely take a while.

I'm just hitting a point where I feel like I can't keep doing this, but I don't want to make things worse on us by quitting before I've lined something else up. What should I do?",finance

My girlfriend and I are looking to purchase a home for around 75,000 in CT.  It needs work, sure, but we're pretty handy and have a substantial family tree of craftsmen who would help us renovate properly.    


I have never taken out a home loan or personal loan, so I am unsure which I should go for.  I'd like to borrow 100k to purchase and renovate.  Would this be smarter under a home loan or personal loan situation?   


Am I even able to take a home loan out and use some of the money for improvements or is it strictly for purchasing power?    


My credit score is fairly decent hovering around 750 with the intent of working hard to improve before beginning this process.  What would a realistic interest rate be?  I've read a good interest rate could be as low as 5%, but not sure if that's only applicable to golden child credit history.

Bitcoin,"The Global Debt Bubble Exceeds $240 Trillion; If It Pops, How Will the Bitcoin (BTC) Market React?","[https://cryptoiq.co/the-global-debt-bubble-exceeds-240-trillion-if-it-pops-how-will-the-bitcoin-btc-market-react/](https://cryptoiq.co/the-global-debt-bubble-exceeds-240-trillion-if-it-pops-how-will-the-bitcoin-btc-market-react/)

As of April, the global debt bubble had reached [$243 trillion](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-22/cataclysmic-243-trillion-global-debt-bomb-will-explode-impoverishing-everyone), which is apparently three times the global GDP. This is in addition to $750 trillion of derivatives, and adding this to the debt total means there is around [$1 quadrillion of financial obligations globally](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-04-16/global-debt-bubble-hits-new-all-time-high-one-quadrillion-reasons-buy-gold). 

To imagine this number, if you stacked a quadrillion dollar bills, it would be 67,866,160 miles high, enough to stretch to the Moon and back [140 times!](https://www.ehd.org/science_technology_largenumbers.php) 

The question we’re looking at here is what will happen to the Bitcoin (BTC) market if all of these debts and derivatives begin to default?

The [2008 Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) is an example of what happens when massive debt bubbles pop. Essentially, the banks were providing mortgages to anyone who wanted them, and then these risky mortgages were grouped into sub-prime mortgage securities.

As these securities began to default. it caused a chain reaction leading to the collapse of numerous banks and corporations that were holding the securities. This lead to even more defaults and so on. 

The Great Recession was only halted by the Fed printing trillions of dollars, leading to fiat inflation, but not enough inflation to collapse major global fiat currencies. This event coincided with the launch of Bitcoin (BTC) since Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to create a decentralized currency that could not be printed at will. 

It seems the current global debt bubble is actually a continuation of the Great Recession. The money printing that was used to bail out the economy never stopped, and currently, banks and corporations can obtain essentially free money because of suppressed interest rates. 

[Michael Krieger from Liberty Blitzkreig](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-05-13/gold-bitcoin-gigantic-global-debt-bubble) describes the situation succinctly:

&gt;“While we’re on the topic of bubbles, it seems the truly gigantic bubble in the world isn’t Bitcoin, but rather the global debt market. This leviathan now stands at around $233 trillion, or 318 percent of global GDP. Even more troubling, an estimated $11 trillion of government debt now trades at negative yields. This means whoever is buying this paper is doing so despite the fact they are guaranteed to lose money on the “investment.” Much of this buying has been propelled by central banks that can print their own currency and buy debt indiscriminately. This is not characteristic of a healthy financial system (particularly so many years into a global recovery), but rather a zombie one that’s been artificially propped up since the financial crisis.”

As Krieger says, negative-yielding debt is soaring, meaning someone can borrow money and pay back less than they borrowed. Further, [junk bond rates are approaching zero](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/global-debt-bubble-enters-its-blow-stage) despite their risk. This situation may represent one last grasp for cash before the bubble pops. 

In the situation that debts begin to default en masse, it would look quite similar to the Great Recession at first, with banks and corporations going bankrupt, leading to a debt default chain reaction. Except this time, central banks would have little to no room to drop interest rates to stimulate the economy, and money printing would likely be the only alternative to stop the crash. 

If the global debt bubble pops, and central banks decide to print money to bail out corporations and banks that are “too big to fail,” it could lead to fiat inflation and, in the worst case scenario, fiat hyperinflation. 

If that happens, Bitcoin (BTC) would be in a prime position to rally. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is decentralized and has a fixed supply that will eventually reach 21 million coins, so Bitcoin (BTC) would be one of the only currencies in the world not being printed. If fiat inflation happens Bitcoin’s (BTC) price would automatically rise, since Bitcoin (BTC) is pegged relative to fiat. Further, Bitcoin (BTC) would be a safe haven for people to protect themselves against rapidly devaluating currency. This could cause a rally all by itself since the price of Bitcoin (BTC) would rise as people seek shelter in it, making Bitcoin (BTC) one of the only profitable investment options in the world, causing even more people to buy Bitcoin (BTC).

Conversely, it is also possible that if the global debt bubble pops and the economy collapses that Bitcoin (BTC) will initially crash too, since people will have to cash out of their Bitcoin (BTC) investments in order to pay for food and rent after losing big on their stock investments or losing their jobs. 

The scenarios described in this article involve plenty of ifs, and this is all merely speculation, but it is certainly something to think about considering the historically bad debt situation worldwide.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Lump Sum Debt Service - Free Cash Going Forward or Attack High Interest Rates?,"I have a conundrum that I can't seem to get my head around. Currently I am looking at paying down a portion of about $20k in credit card debt (Average of 25% interest) with a $3,000 lump sum from equity in a car I'm selling. At the same time I have a personal loan with a balance of ~$2,000 at a rate of 8%.

My current minimum payments on the cards are around $500-$600 per month. The personal loan payment is around $300 per month. In my mind attacking the $20k high interest balances with the lump sum seems to be the best strategy, but I also think that freeing up the extra $300 per month by paying off the loan to make additional payments on the cards may be a better long term solution. I will start kicking in an extra $300/month on the credit card debt by getting rid of the car payment.

Future plans: My credit score isn't great, somewhere in the mid 600's. I don't think my chances of opening a new credit card and transferring the debt are good. I think in a few months with car payment gone, my income/debt ratio will look much better, so I may apply for balance transfer cards then. The car payment was around $300/month as well that I can now go after credit card debt with as well. Issues with credit score - balances are too high, age of credit accounts (oldest is about 7 years).",finance

Quick breakdown:

1. Student Loans are $19,000 @ 5.53% (10 years),
2. Car Loan is $15,500 @ 4.49% (6 years)

I'd appreciate any input on whether or not there is more to consider outside of just the interest rates.

personalfinance,Calculating One-Time Refinance Costs,"I currently have a 30 year mortgage that I'm 2 years into with an outstanding balance of $204k at 4.25% interest, my current mortgage provider is local - the recent downward trend in interest rates has me looking at refinancing.  Just looking at [https://www.bankrate.com](https://www.bankrate.com) it appears that there are refinance offers as low as 3.5% for 30 year's with 0 points - but I have a few questions about this:

1) Do the 'Upfront Costs' mentioned on the page include all costs associated with refinancing or is it literally just the fee charged by the lender, and then I would have to pay additional for anything that comes up such as appraisal and etc?

2) Are there any potential problems with switching to one of these 'no name' lenders that are online only?

3) I'm assuming I would make back the cost of refinancing in approximately one year in terms of overall savings - once the Refi is done I would take half of my monthly payment savings and apply it to the payment as extra.  So if currently I pay $1,374 ($1,074 required + 300 extra I do every month) after the refinance I would pay the same plus add \~$120, so $1,594 a month - over the life of the new loan I believe I would save a few tens of thousands of dollars in interest, but would anyone mind double checking my math?",finance

I am currently going through a home purchase; we were originally scheduled to close this past Tuesday; however, through the process we discovered that the current homeowners had filed bankruptcy and it is now delaying the closing by an undetermined amount of time (possibly October 1st but it has not been confirmed).

Our mortgage rate is set to expire this Friday and we have an option to request a rate extension (at a cost that we will most likely try and have the sellers pay because the closing date move is all on them). However, I'm curious if it would be more beneficial for us to allow the rate to expire and go back out to market with the fed rate decreasing by .25% today. 

We currently have a rate of 3.75% with credit scores around 750 and are putting down 20% on the home purchase. What would be best for us to do, and are there hidden costs going back out to market that I am not anticipating?

personalfinance,"CP2000 no confirmation letter, is this normal?","I received a CP2000 regarding my 2016 taxes towards the end of 2018. It was sent to an old address and I never got the notice. I only knew that I had been issued a CP2000 when my 2018 state refund had been levied and I got a notice from the state of AZ. The total additional 2016 taxes proposed were about $8,000.00

At that point I tracked down the CP2000 and had them send another copy to my current address. I didn't agree with the proposed changes and so I submitted my response with the appropriate documentation in May 2019. 

In August 2019 I received a direct deposit into my bank account from the IRS totaling the amount of my 2018 federal refund that had been levied and then I soon after received a check in the mail from the IRS totaling the amount of my 2018 state refund. When I logged into my online IRS account which originally showed the $8,000.00 owed it was now cleared out with a $0.00 balance. 

Great news because they accepted my dispute and agreed that the originally filed taxes were correct and released the back taxes owed plus returned my levied tax money. The problem is its over a month after I received the money back and I still have not gotten a letter confirming the decision. 

Per IRS Publication 5181 ""Tax Return Reviews by Mail CP2000"" page 5 step 2 ""If we accept your explanation, we’ll send you a letter stating we accept your return as filed. You should keep the letter with your tax records."" I never received any type of notification that they received my CP2000 response nor have I ever received a confirmation that they accepted my return as filed. All I ever got was my money back. 

I've tried calling multiple times (the number on top of my CP2000) but they are ""unable to process my request at this time"" and disconnect the call after 1hr on hold every time. I am wasting huge amounts of time trying to reach them regarding the letter. I would like a record of the dispute but if its not critical I would also like to stop calling needlessly. 

Is this typical or should I have any concern that I haven't gotten a letter from them? Is this worth pursuing or if anything comes up can I use the check that they mailed back to me as justification? Right now on my online IRS account I dont see any record of anything even happening, its all zeroed out.

I'm a single 23 year old dude fresh out of college working his first big boi job. Right now I got a nice little apartment, but I want to move into a house mainly so I can have a garage to work on cars and other projects. I originally looked at houses to rent but a few things turned me off. Most of the houses were maintained to the bare minimum of livability, a lot of places around here don't allow pets (no pets currently but I do want a cat), and the cost was right around $1,500 a month. Similar houses are between $100,000 and $200,000 around here. I did a little napkin math and found that $1,500 a month will basically get me a 15 year mortgage on buying a house around here. Thanks to some leftovers in my college fund, I also have a good chunk of change for a down payment. With 20% on a 15 year mortgage, I can be out of the interest and into the principal in about 3 years. There is also a decent smattering of houses for sale around here with multiple or extra large garages. The main concern I have with buying a house is unpredictability. First, there's the potential of a recession rolling in and destroying the housing market. The other issue for me is that I'm not really in love with my job and location. I might stay here another 3 years or I might dip out sometime in 2020. I'm lucky in life that if worse comes to worse I can pay off the house in full but with low interest rates I figure I'd rather keep the money invested.

My finances are as follows

* $67,000 annual gross income from my job
* 18% contribution to my 401k (9% standard, 9% Roth. Will probably spin half off into a Roth IRA in the future)
* $3,200 a month take home pay
* $60,000 total in checking and savings (this would be the source of my down payment)
* $525,000 total in a stock portfolio (Just lucky to be born in the right family. I try not to touch this if necessary and more or less treat my finances as if it doesn't exist. If I did have to bail out of the house suddenly this would be what I would use to pay off the remaining mortgage after selling the house.)
* $885 rent a month for my current apartment
* $600 a month in bills and expenses (not living extravagantly but not frugally either)

I've recently started digging into how I can optimize some aspects of my finances, and the biggest obligation I have is my mortgage. In December of 2017 I bought my home with a 30 year fixed FHA mortgage for $224,000. My home was then appraised at $245,000 as part of the FHA mortgage process. I'm current on the mortgage, and my balance is roughly $219,000. My current interest rate is 5.5%, and my credit score is currently an 806. 

I'm looking into an FHA Streamline Refinance for a few reasons:
1. Lower interest rate
2. Remove PMI
3. Reduce monthly payment
4. Little to no upfront closing costs

I have a few questions I'm hoping to get some help with:

1. Where is the best place to compare ""FHA streamline"" options and rates?

2. I currently have an escrow account with my mortgage that has a balance of around $2,800. What happens to that money if I refinance?
 
3. Are there any factors/aspects of refinancing an FHA mortgage that I might be overlooking that may help/hurt?

Long story short, I got into a real bad bind financially a few years ago and had to file bankruptcy and slowly build my credit and stuff back up.

I got an offer to reduce it to 6.5% at about $350 for a month, but I have to extend the loan out for 5 years. There was another for like $200 for 8 years, but fuck that noise.

My gut is telling me to just wait the 3 years out. But I'm also thinking about taking the lower interest rate and payment, use the extra money to pay down some debt a bit quicker and just snowball everything into the car loan.

I recently moved and got a higher paying job, $77,000, with health insurance about $83 a month and a 5% 401k match, my rent is about $1800. My credit is a 739 (5 queries in the last 2 years, 3 this year, 1 in Apr 2018, 1 in Aug 2018).

I have about $7k dollars saved up in ""accessible cash"" and $3k dollars in a IRA from my previous job. I performed a couple of soft queries through SoFi and Earnest and got the following:

SoFi:

5 years:    $1468.86/month -- 4.54% &lt;-- Out of budget for me

7 years:    $1105.37 -- 4.74% &lt;-- Likely on the fringe of my budget w/o a new vehicle

10 years:  $840.68 -- 5.04%

15 years:  $634.63 -- 5.139%

20 years: $528.04 --- 5.020%

15 Years: $611.49  ---  4.82%

20 Years: $525.14 ---- 5.20%

Forex,Several questions about various interest rates,"Hi! I've been looking up several countries interest rates and I am confused by the whole range of rates that different countries use. For example, I recently found out that the fed fund rate and US discount rate are two different rates.  

When a carry trade is performed, which type of rate is used to calculate the interest rate differential?  I think its the discount rate, because the definition is that it is the interest rate that the central bank charges for its loans. A follow up question: if the discount rate is used for carry trades, then how does the fed fund rate or any other countries interbank rate influence exchange rates? If the fed fund rate and not the discount rate is used, then how do discount rates influence exchange rates? I guess another way to phrase the question is, is the discount rate or fed fund rate used when calculating a forward exchange rate with the US and another country? And if one of them is used for it, then how would the other rate influence exchange rates?  


Also LIBOR and EURIBOR really confuse me, is that the rate that central banks charge each other for interest rates?(where as the fed fund rate is for only banks in the united states)

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Strategy.. Consolidation?,"I have been living abroad for quite some time and have only been paying the minimum for quite some time now. I am so tired of having these monkeys on my back. I have $1000 per month to put towards these loans. I could also put a bit of savings towards these loans (5k, I would probably like to keep 2-3K for a rainy day). Should I consider reconsolidating the federal loans? I have read mixed things online. I would like to pay these off ASAP so that I can start saving for a house and retirement.. Within the next year would be ideal (I would have to perhaps throw a bit more than 1K for this to happen I suppose). Would you snowball the small loans to knock those out, or just go full-force on my high-interest ones? Any advice or experiences would be more than welcome and appreciated. All my loans are currently with Navient. Thanks r/personalfinance!!

personalfinance,Refinancing advice,"Hey guys, 

So 5 years ago I bought a one-family house ($200k at 4% interest) with my son as the co-signer because I didn't have much income for a loan all on my own. Now we want to refinance because: 1. interest rates went down 2. he wants to buy an investment property on his own. My wife and I have a small business which my wife is technically the owner (on paperwork) where we make enough to pay the home mortgage, store rent, and expenses and not a lot left in net profit (around $500) per month. We haven't spoken to any banks or mortgage lenders yet.

so the question: 

How can we refinance to take my son out of the mortgage? Can my wife report higher income from the business to be able to refinance with just our name? Or can my son qualify for another loan if he is tied up with us on this house? His annual income is around $60k. I am open to all suggestions and ideas before I  talk to a lender just to know what to expect. 

Also if anyone knows a good lender that they would recommend in the NY/NJ area I would appreciate it.",finance

Currently it's a roughly $13,500 loan at 5.35% interest over 5 years (already refinanced it in January). With the Fed lowering rates, I was wondering if 1) can I and should I refinance to a lower rate, and 2) what range of rates can I be expecting with a good credit score (north of 740)?

personalfinance,cc as temp small emergency fund until 17%apr debt is paid off?,"I'm starting to tackle my debts now. I'm almost at a point where I can think of putting some money away as an emergency fund, but I still have a 7k left on my auto loan that's 17%APR. That'll probably take me around 6-7 months to knock out. After that I have student loans, but they average about 4% apr so I can start putting away for a real emergency fund then.

Is it better to try and pay that auto loan off ASAP before setting money aside in an emergency fund at that interest rate? I'm thinking because of that interest rate I should try and finish it off. If I do have to use the cc for an emergency then I'll do the minimum on the car for a month and pay the cc off then jump back on track. Is that math in my favor?

edit: thanks for the responds and tips! I think I'll go with [Econ0mist](https://www.reddit.com/user/Econ0mist/) suggestion of Digital FCU savings. By not putting $1k away I only have to pay a bit more interest on the loan, because it'll only extend my payment for one extra month. Having a a peace of mind plus 6% apr is worth it 👍",finance

personalfinance,Aspiration Spend and Save Account - Recent Interest Rate and Deposit Requirement Change,"To anyone with this account, YOU NEED TO READ THIS.

The last email I received has informed me that the interest rate is 1.00% now, half of what we used to be getting. That's fine, it's back to what it used to be when I signed up for the account in 2017.  However, this line is what confused me:

&gt;***The requirement to access our highest rate has not changed...*** *you can earn 1.00% APY on the entire balance in your Save account by either depositing a total of* ***$1,000*** *into any of your Aspiration accounts within that month*

To my previous understanding, you only had to deposit **$1.00** into your account to get the previously 2.00% interest rate. In fact, just back in July, I received an email reminder stating this:

&gt;*to earn 2.00% APY interest on your Aspiration Save balance in any given month, you need to deposit at least $1.00 from an external source into any of your Aspiration accounts*

I have checked EVERY email since then, and I was never notified of the required deposit change from **$1.00** to a now ludicrous **$1000.00**. Which completely contradicts the line stating that the requirement has not changed. It clearly has, and in no way by a minuscule amount.

This is either a very substantial lack of communication on Aspiration's part, or a very misplaced decimal point. Either way, I have lost a lot of respect and trust in the company and will be moving my funds to another account that doesn't have insane restrictions on how I can even earn any amount of interest on a savings account.",finance

personalfinance,Should I sell or rent my condo?,"Context: I am 38, live in Southern California and I'm currently in escrow on an $800K home. In addition, I am getting a good rate from a bank which includes 15% down with no PMI, and an effective rate of 3.5% for a 30 year fixed. This may drop as well if rates keep going down.

I currently own and live in a 2 bedroom condo 1000 sq ft in a pretty hot rental market area. I purchased it for $285K in 2012 and it is now worth about $535K based on comps. I originally got a 15-year loan with a 2.875% interest rate. I have approximately $135K left on the mortgage. So I am looking at $375K equity after selling fees and nearing the max of the home sales tax exemption of 250K (I'm not married).

If I rent the condo I can probably get $2500 on the market. My current costs are about $2200 after mortgage, taxes, and HOA. In about 8 years, it will be paid off. 

Here are some other facts:

* I have about $400K in retirement (401k, IRA)
* I have $275K in cash ($120 will be going towards the down payment of the new home)
* I have a very consistent job with 200K salary+bonus. Extra 50K a year from consulting side hustle.
* I most likely would hire a property manager at 5-10% to manage the rental as I do not have the time nor want to be a landlord
* I can see rents steadily going up in this area, but I feel that the price of the home seems very high to me at $535K for what it is. So it might be a good idea to capitalize on the price and get the tax free gains.
* The HOA is $386 and I hate it. I can also see it going up. The condo community is 27 years old and there might be assessments coming soon. I do worry about that sometimes.

Maybe it's the exhaustion from the new home stuff, but I am having trouble deciding what to do. Would I be much better off taking the $375K equity and immediately investing that in index funds or continue working on paying down the condo with renters until it's paid off and renting that out? 

In the end, I am more interested in reaching FIRE and that doesn't necessarily require owning multiple properties.",finance

personalfinance,"Deciding on new Checking, and maybe Savings Account","I know a number of these posts have been made over the years but things change pretty quickly.

My money is all in BMO Harris Bank right now. The nice thing about them is that they are literally everywhere in Madison, and the refund maybe 10 ATM fees per month. Easy to cash checks which I occasionally get.

But that's it as far as benefits. Piss-poor interest rates, have foreign transaction fees, etc. They've also gotten on my bad side a few times trying to sell me one of their other services, like a home mortgage. So I'm looking for something new. 

- I'm primarily looking at high-yield checking accounts along with one that offer cash back. I won't have any problem hitting 10-12 transaction per month.

- Must have reimbursed ATM fees. I occasionally travel so no foreign transaction fees are nice, but isn't a must, if worse comes to worse I'd open a second account with that feature just for foreign travel.

- Right now I haven't been able to keep a very high balance, though I'm planning on working on that this year. Anyways, until then I'm thinking I'll make more on a cash back account. Those that offer 1% rates, is that generally for anything including bills? I would assume credit cards payments aren't included.

- I need some way to occasionally cash a check, although if there is some alternative that doesn't involve a bank I'm fine with that.

- a nice to have, being able to sign up purely online, but not nearly as important

- Radius (1% interest and 1% cash back)

For the past 3 mornings the FED has done something that hasn’t been done since 2008.  They have moved a ton of money very quickly to ease the overnight borrowing markets... is how I understand it.  They are doing it because the central banks HAVE A LIQUIDITY PROBLEM.

personalfinance,[Debt] I have student loan payments coming up that I can't afford.,"So, I graduated from college this past May (2019), and my loan payments will be starting in December (2019). The payments right now are at ~1500 a month, which is just barely less than what I'm making right now.

I'm looking for a change in careers, which is a whole different story, but for then time being have to assume that my current income will be what I am making when payments start.

I paid my way through college on my own, so I took out about $25,000 loan for each year of university, totaling ~$100,000 debt overall. They were all fixed interest rates, and I think each of them hover around 10% interest.

What's the best plan to tackle this? Right now I'm living at home to try and save up some money, but I don't have a healthy living situation at home and I'm trying to get out of it.

I've contacted the bank (Wells Fargo) about consolidation and delaying payments, but they've been absolutely no help and basically told me I have to wait until closer to December to talk about it.

Bitcoin,“It was the largest plunge of the franc ever against the euro.” + Andreas Antonopoulos in India,"2011–2014: Big movements and capping

In March 2011, the franc climbed past the US$1.10 mark (CHF 0.91 per U.S. dollar). In June 2011, the franc climbed past US$1.20 (CHF 0.833 per U.S. dollar) as investors sought safety as the Greek sovereign debt crisis continued.[16] Continuation of the same crisis in Europe and the debt crisis in the US propelled the Swiss franc past US$1.30 (CHF 0.769 per U.S. dollar) as of August 2011, prompting the Swiss National Bank to boost the franc's liquidity to try to counter its ""massive overvaluation"".[17] The Economist argued that its Big Mac Index in July 2011 indicated an overvaluation of 98% over the dollar, and cited Swiss companies releasing profit warnings and threatening to move operations out of the country due to the strength of the franc.[18] Demand for francs and franc-denominated assets was so strong that nominal short-term Swiss interest rates became negative.[19]

On 6 September 2011, shortly after when the exchange rate was 1.095 CHF/€[20] and appeared to be heading for parity with the euro, the SNB set a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 francs to the euro (capping franc's appreciation), saying ""the value of the franc is a threat to the economy"",[21] and that it was ""prepared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities"".[22] In response to this announcement the franc fell against the euro, to 1.22 francs from 1.12 francs[23] and lost 9% against the U.S. dollar within fifteen minutes.[24] The intervention stunned currency traders, since the franc had long been regarded as a safe haven.[25]

The franc fell 8.8% against the euro, 9.5% against the dollar, and at least 8.2% against all 16 of the most active currencies on the day of the announcement. It was the largest plunge of the franc ever against the euro.[26] The SNB had previously set an exchange rate target in 1978 against the Deutsche mark and maintained it,[clarification needed] although at the cost of high inflation.[27] Until mid-January 2015, the franc continued to trade below the target level set by the SNB,[28] though the ceiling was broken at least once on 5 April 2012, albeit briefly.[29]

“What arbitrage activity tells you is not that bitcoin is worth $12,000 here, but that rupees are discounted 20% against hard assets, including other national currencies. The market is sending you a signal. A currency that cannot move across borders is worth less.”

investing,What the F*&amp;$@ is a repo? Eli5 inside.,"Okay, it's become apparent that the vast majority of you don't know what a repo is.  That's fine, you can largely live your life and invest successfully without this knowledge.  But it is the topic du jour so let's see if I can't offer the most simplistic of explanations here to help provide some context of today's events.

Lets say you have 10 brothers and sisters.  You're all young adults and have been quite successful in life.  Your father is pretty conservative and asks that you keep your savings primarily in treasuries so you do.  

Right now you have 1MM in 10yr treasuries saved up but you don't have a lot of cash on hand.  The cable bill is due today and you get paid tomorrow.  Wat do?  You can of course liquidate some of your million worth of bonds but that's silly right?  Your brother has 500k of cash sitting in his weed box.  So you waltz over to his room and ask for $100 to cover the cable and promise to pay him back tomorrow.  He thinks you're a bit of an asshole so he says no because he doesn't trust you.  So you offer him this: you sell him $100 worth of your treasury bonds and he tells you he'll sell it back to you tomorrow for $100.01.  Congrats you've funded your need for cash today while preserving your balance sheet.  That's a repurchase agreement or repo. 

So now you and your siblings have a thriving market of trading these overnight promises back and forth all while your dad is slowly selling more bonds to you and taking your cash.  Eventually you run in to a problem where there just ain't enough cash right?  Your brother the dick decides to still offer the same agreement but tomorrow instead of you buying your $100 worth of bonds for $100.01 he tells you he needs $105.  That's a huge difference but given how little cash everyone has you might need to pay it.  Enter your mom, she keeps the family in order but doesn't normally like to step in to the finances.  She tells you she'll start buying your bonds and selling them back tomorrow at the aforementioned $100.01.  That's what the Fed has been doing lately.

Takeaway: nobody here is bankrupt or insolvent.  You've all got millions of dollars worth of bonds but you need cash to fund short term obligations and there just isn't much going around.   

Obviously the real world is significantly more complex but this should serve as a very basic framework of understanding for what repos are and what some of the news you've been reading means.

E: I want to be clear: this is nothing short of the most dumbed down explanation possible.  If you're looking to further explore this topic it's best to abandon the analogies and dive right in.  I generally don't love analogies in thus world because at some point someone's trying to argue if the FDIC is your uncle roofus who vouches for you or your dads side chick that slips you money to not fuck up.  That doesn't help anyone.  So once you get a grasp on the basic framework you should either decide if that's good enough for you or expect a much steeper learning curve from there.",finance

Currently in the restaurant industry and I am at wits end at the current job, but budgeting the best I can. Staying on subject, I was wondering if it would be a good idea to get everything taken care of with a $xx,xxx fixed loan with one payment per month at the cost of putting out more money in the long run comfortably or just stick it out and go month by month until all dues are paid? Any advice is greatly appreciated.
  
Update: Did the basic stuff and totaled everything right under 25000 and 17.2%; I think the main two that definitely need to clear out is the card and loan (under 8300 and 10.3% together). The hard part I think is going to actually find the right lender/rates.",finance

I'll listen everything below.

the toolbox and care credit card have a high interest rate in the 20-26% range and I can get a personal loan for 12.75% to pay off the phone devices, toolbox and care credit card and bring down my monthly payment by around $200/month and spread out the payment dates to help ease the pain.

personalfinance,Seeking advice on savings/debt payoff plan,"Hi everyone, I am looking for input on how I allocate my extra income. Overall I (26) am trying to pay off debt and save for a down payment.

Breakdown of income: Approx 53K annual gross Net income $2720 monthly, after taxes/health insurance/ 401k

For my 401k, suggestions are welcome: I contribute 8% pre-tax right now, and my company matches up to 50% of whatever I contribute. So right now they contribute 4%. Since I see a lot of people do 6% with match, I set these numbers so I align with the total 12% contribution it seems like a lot of people have.

Edit to add: I was actually wrong about the 401k match, many thanks to commentor who prompted me to double check. They match 50% up to 5% gross salary, not to exceed federal limits. So for me, I can do up to 10% to get the 50% match advantage.. whoops. Please correct me if my interpretation is still wrong



Rigid bills: not really seeking advice here just showing breakdown Rent: 565 Internet: 50 Electric: 60 Car insurance: 100 (no car payment) Phone 110 (will decrease to about 70 after paying off device in about four months) Netflix 15 Family loan 150 (non-negotiable) Food/gas/other 320 (50/week food, 30/week gas, 10/week buffer for extra expenses) Total: 1370

This leaves me with approx $1350 towards student loan debt, cc debt, and saving. My main reason to post is to show how I'm dividing this money, and see if you guys think I can make better use of it.

So, debts/plans: Credit card: One card with a balance ~$4000. 0% interest until sep 2020 since it was a balance transfer. Min is approx 100. I have a lot of open accounts with 0 balance so this is very minimal impact on my credit.

Student loan: One account, ~$11000 at 4% fixed interest in level repayment. Min $150/month My company has a program to pay $100/month towards my loan up to 6k (aka five years). It has been about a year, so $4800/4years available.

Savings: Want to add to emergency fund (current $1k ish) And Save for a down payment. Currently have 1k ish. Need about 10k for my part (saving with my bf) to meet goal for what we want to buy

My plan: Aggressively pay off cc next 3-4 months. I know it is 0 interest, but I want to get it out of the way. Full amount 1350 towards it

After that,:

Pay student loan slowly at 150/m in order to take advantage of employer assistance. I could pay it off faster but then I would lose some of the assistance the company offers

Save 1200 monthly, divided approx 400 emergency / 800 down payment. Aim to have the 10k end 2020 ish

Note: all this does not take into account any bonus or raise so I am being conservative here. The student loan part of my plan is contingent on on staying employed here, if not I will modify that plan.

So, does this seem like a decent plan, or is there a better way I should allocate the money?",finance

personalfinance,25 year old couple planning for the future,"Hello Personal Finance!
Anon, cause friends know my regular account and I don't want them knowing all of my business!

I'd appreciate some guidance/recommendations on how to plan for the future as my fiancee and I are a little unsure. I am good at month to month budgeting thanks to you guys!

Apologies for the incoming wall and any spelling issues.

A little about us: 
25 yo, due to be married next year (estimate that we will pay around 10k for it on top of what her parents are paying. 
I've got an office job pulling mid 50s, she's an attorney making triple that. Rounding down, 200k is a good number to work with. 


She's got somewhere from 15 to 20k in student loans (taken so there is money remaining in her trust fund that was meant for college/house; it also helped her credit score as she was reporting no credit score on credit karma etc). 
No other debt (car, CC, etc). 
Maybe 5k is easily accessible savings and 50 in the aforementioned trust. 
No other monthly bills specific to her.
3% to 401k (100% match), 2% to IRA (at least I think these are both true, she just set them up)

I've got maybe 30k in student loans (4% interest rate) remaining.
About 6k (3.5% interest) on my car (worth 11k on kbb, if that matters)
$11,500 on credit card (13.5%)
Personal loan with $8,200 at 7%
Roughly 1.5 to 2k in savings for a rainy day.
(Jesus... Almost 60k)
5 or 6% salary to 401k

Fixed monthly expenses are sub 3k. 

Obviously, we want to pay some debt down and will do so pretty aggressively (plan on doing 4k per month, if not more). Will paying off this debt too quickly negatively impact our credit scores? (Mine fluctuates between 730 and 770, hers originally did not show up on anything, but through some of my counseling it has gone to 720 or so last I looked)
I am thinking about opening a savings with Marcus/Ally (unless there are better ones now?) To store some extra funds in. Aside from that, any other recommendations for storing money?
Any recommendations for planning for the future? I don't know if 401k is the way to go vs anything else (I should read more about these). 

We are unsure if we will go on her work's health insurance or mine - are HSAs dependant on that? From what I understand, one could put pre tax dollars into an HSA to use for post retirement (I assume there's an age component as well?) Medical related expenses.

Should I just seek out a financial advisor to learn this? Or a CPA? I don't even know.

Any other tips? Tricks? Things to avoid? Hate for being 25 and a household income of over 200?

I am about to sign the final paperwork, and although I asked through the process and 99% sure I am correct and should not be worried, I just want to triple check the terminology in the final contract so that I don't sign something stupid. 

The contact has a section called loan calculations.  (see below)

My question:  I assume the section about Finance Charge + Total Interest Percentage (TIP) are if I pay the minimum amount for the full term, correct?

I just want to triple check that this means that if I pay this down faster, then I am still not somehow paying the full Finance Charge when this is all said and done.  This is only the total amount if I do not pay it down faster.  (I haven't decided yet if I will pay it down faster and/or invest money, but in either case, I wanted to be sure). 

This is how it is worded.  

**Total of Payments. **Total you will have paid after
you make all payments of principal, interest,
mortgage insurance, and loan costs, as scheduled.
$487,413.53

**Finance Charge.** The dollar amount the loan will
cost you.
$99,613.57

**Amount Financed.** The loan amount available after
paying your upfront finance charge.

**Annual Percentage Rate (APR).** Your costs over
the loan term expressed as a rate. This is not your
interest rate.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,New Construction Loan Advice,"My wife and I bought a 30 acre piece of property about 1-1.5 years ago with the intentions of building a house on the land. Fast forward to now, we were just approved for a construction loan, but I want to get some opinions on the details of the load and if they are ""normal"" and overall advice if we are in a solid position to go through this process.

Information:

Household Income - 158k W/ No Debts (other than current mortgage which will be sold)

Current Land Mortgage - 127k Valued at 205k by the bank

Construction Costs - ~~525k~~ 425K

Minimum Planned Down Payment - 40k from home sale and cash

Goal monthly house payment after construction - 3000/ month

3000/  month payment gives us DTI of 24% with savings plan of 22% (15% retirement, 8% cash)

Loan Details:

The Construction Loan is going to be a 2 time closing. We are taking what is left on the land mortgage and rolling it into the loan for construction. My wife is the GC for the house and we have an estimated build price of 425k, but we added a buffer in for incidentals that could happen during construction so we told the bank 500k. This is the main reason for the 2 time closing because at the end of construction when we come in under, we want to be able to re-finance for the amount that we spent not what we initially budgeted for.

Approved Loan Amount - 600K

Loan Term - 12 months interest only

Rate - 7.25% - This rate is adjustable. From what I understand construction loans follow the fed rate and can change. TheLoan Package says the max rate is 17.25% on this loan. This is what is giving me issues.

If we move forward with the Loan then they order an appraisal for the Land and the Future House based off of the plans we gave them with details. Our goal is to come in with an appraisal that is higher than the build price of course, if that doesn't happen then none of this even matters because we probably wont move forward.

Another quirk is that our lender is a Private Farm Credit Lender and pays you back 20-25% of the interest that you paid during the course of the year. This year we got 25% of the interest we paid of the land loan back.

Questions:

1. Is this a crazy high rate or normal for construction?
2. Are construction loan rates usually adjustable?
3. Is the DTI we have acceptable at end of construction?

Really i'm hoping for some overall advice or opinions of anyone who has gone through this process before. Its going to be stressful, its going to be extensive, but in the end we believe that the risk and time will be well worth the reward. Thank you for reading my word barf.

personalfinance,Bank of America denying 9999.42 fraud charges.,"I run a small business. I am the sole owner. I have 11 employees. 

Recently I noticed all kinds of fraud charges on my account. 133 to be exact, totalling $9999.42. I called their fraud department and was assured I will be protected by their 0 liability guarantee. They said it will take no more than 10 days to get it refunded. 

About 6 days into it, I call them for a status update. The lady told me everything is in progress, if not resolved by the 19th, then the full ammount will be deposited into my account. 

I call on the 19th and get the news that the claim was ""not resolved in my favor.""  The 2 main reasons were:

Why did it take me so long to notice all these?
Answer: I have 11 employees, each with a debit card. Each employee averages about 10 transactions a day. 

How did my card information get stolen?
This is ridiculous. I have no idea. They told me I need to show proof that it was stolen. I live in Oregon, nearly all these transactions were done in South Carolina. It seems completely unfair that I have to prove how my info was stolen. How would I know that?

I am going to give then one more call this morning, and be a lot more firm. I'm feeling I will get the same answers though. 

What should I do? 

I am thinking I should serve them a formal demand letters and if that fails take them to small claims court. The maximum is 10k in Oregon, and I'm .58 cents under it! 

Anyone have any tips? Seems like their 0 liability guaranteed is false advertising. I'm aware they likely have some stupid fine print lingo, voiding it all. But I am hoping a judge would see it my way. 

Thanks.

Edit 1: Talking to a higher up manager now. Who is giving major attitude.

Edit 2: Thank you everybody for all of the advice. To be clear, it was only MY debit card that all of this fraud happened on. The reason I mentioned 11 employees is because, when you log onto the BOFA home page, it shows everybody's transactions all on one page. So really, I never see anything other than an entire page of PENDING. I understand, in all realism, I should have been monitoring closer.

I spoke the a tier 3 manager yesterday, who still fed me the same line of garbage. She also told me, that if I selected one transaction, that was authorized, they are able to deny the ENTIRE claim. Luckily I have thoroughly reviewed them, and I know I did not. IT really seems like they are putting the burden of proof on me, and even going as far as questioning my word in a sense. She offered to re-open the claim, but told me it would take 45 days to reach a decision, just to see if they WILL reopen it. Once reopened, then they would do the same investigation again.

At this point I really feel I have two options. First one is going to small claims court. I could file this case on Monday, and have it served on Tuesday. That would give them 10 days to respond. It would at least show them I am serious, and get their attention.

Second one is, what some on the commentators are saying is file a report with the  Consumer Financial Protection Board. I am not sure if this covers businesses though.

So I am really leaning towards small claims court. It seems like my only shot at some possible resolution, unless anyone can recommend anything else.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my car or let my money keep growing in mutual fund?,"Hi guys, I recently had to buy a new car after my old one shat the bed.  I put $5000 down on the car and still owe around $7000.  I have a little over $5000 in my regular bank account and another $8400 in my mutual fund.   I net $2800 a month and my car payment would be $150 over the next 5 years.  I wouldn't want to go under $3000 in my bank account just to have security.  Over the 5 years I would pay a total of about $1000 interest, but if I keep regularly contributing  $100 a month to the mutual fund and pay the $150 car payment I feel like the mutual fund would make way more then $1000 for me over the next 5 years given the amount already in it.  If I chose to pay the car off then I would have to take around $5000 out of my mutual fund leaving me with $3400 and my mutual fund growing way slower. Although I would be able to contribute a little more to it.  What are your guys thoughts on this?

tl;dr
Pay car off leaving me with 3400 in mutual fund and grow slower even if I can contribute a little more

personalfinance,"Trying to refinance my private student loans, but my mother is the primary borrower of one and I'm the co-signer.","Hey all.

So, I've been out of school for over a year, and paying off my student loans (federal and private) for a little under a year. I've recently been thinking about refinancing my private loans, of which there are three, because I feel the interest rates are a little high (5.5% to 6.5%) and I can find a lower rates by refinancing.

So, I got to looking at my options, and the first site I started on, Earnest, there was a question about whether I was the primary borrower of my loans. I double checked and realized that the one of the loans is in my mother's name, and I'm the co-signer. I said no on Earnest to see what would happen, and I got a pop-up saying they wouldn't refinance loans in other people's names.

A little more backstory, this loan in my mother's name was actually the first private student loan we took out, and I guess at the time she didn't realize she should be putting it in my name. This is what she told me. As I mentioned earlier, there are three loans in total, two in my name with my mother as co-signer, and one in my mother's name that I'm co-signing. To make things trickier, I'm the one still paying off the loan that I'm co-signing, and she is helping by paying off the lower of the two loans that she is co-signing.

I guess my question is what I should do. Since we're the co-signers to each other, can we take over as the primary borrowers? I'm not the most finance-savvy person, I just want to make sure I'm making smart decisions. For reference, I have no other debts beside student loans, which I've paid on time, and I have a pretty good credit score at 730.

I appreciate any advice I can get, and thanks in advance!",finance

datascience,"I attended a bootcamp career day through work, and these are my thoughts.","I come from a traditional background (B.S. in Math/Econ, M.S. in Statistics) before starting my first DS job and like many of my other peers, have looked down upon the structure of boot camps. Recently through work I was invited to attend a career day where 20 new bootcamp grads presented their capstone project. I went with the goal of possibly opening up my viewpoint on bootcamps, and here are ultimately my thoughts.

**There are some bootcamp people who have very advanced degrees, and are using it to bridge the gap between academia and industry.**

Out of 20 people, 3 had a M.S. and 2 had a PhD. I definitely noticed a more thorough approach in their capstone projects (i.e. carefully deciding on which models to use, understanding their data, understanding model outputs, and effortlessly conveying to the audience what their results produced.) These were definitely the strongest projects, and with their knowledge in academia plus skills like Python, AWS, etc. taught in the bootcamp will most likely land jobs.

**There seems to be a large disconnect between what Data Science is in a bootcamp and Data Science in real life.**

15/20 projects involved Computer Vision, Audio/Image Processing, or NLP. Nearly everyone used pre-trained deep neural nets, word2vec, etc. and just applied their own datasets (often Kaggle sets) and nonsensically add/removed layers to fine tune their model results. Most of the presentations revolved around if their results were cool or not, and this is a very dangerous approach to DS, as:

* You will most likely not be doing deep learning after your bootcamp. This sets an unrealistic goal.
* Some fed their neural nets completely biased datasets, and it was clear that the results were biased as well and they did not realize this
* It was clear that some people did not understand how they work at all, and were just interested in the results and applications. This leads me to:

**The fundamentals of Machine Learning and Statistics seemed to be ignored**

Nearly all of the bachelors level presentations used extremely clean datasets from Kaggle and were essentially cookie cutter projects based off of each other. There was almost no discussion on understanding feature relationships, feature engineering, feature importance, missing value imputation, bias, etc. (the few that did do it stood out to me very well.) Everyone jumped to the strongest models first (deep neural nets, XGBoost) without trying simpler ones to see if it would solve their question. 

All in all, I can see why bootcamps have their appeal (why do a 2 year MS or a 4-6 year PhD when I can land a job in 12 weeks?) and I do believe that they could land jobs in certain places (such as roles that are glorified analysts, basic data engineering, or the modeling is cookie cutter.) However in an environment where businesses are trying to solve unique and tough problems that highly impacts the business, a bootcamper may fail as they don't have the sound fundamentals as someone who has spent years studying the field of ML.

EDIT: I also asked around, and the rate for people landing ML jobs after bootcamps are about 25%.",technology

retirement,One man's Advice (62 / Retired five years),"For people about to retire, I think the most important advise / insight I can give is not to count on Social Security and Medicare. Both are in trouble and will need adjustment to survive. While I am sure both SS and Medicare will be in in the future, I think both will go through changes people need to plan for.

Presently, we are modeling retirement on the past when benefits were rich and well funded. Currently, the demographics have changed on there are a huge group of older, sicker and less financially sound folks entering retirement who are living longer more expensive lives. Basically, the math no longer works.

Currently, the federal budget is under pressure as both SS and Medicare consume more and more of the budget. Lawmakers won’t allow these program to fully consume the budget and will take action probably at midnight before the deadline.

I am expecting and planning that SS and Medicare benefits will be reduced over time. I am expecting they will do it gradually by taxiing a higher % of SS and increasing Medicare payments while reducing what is covered. I am expecting they will implement a wealth tax (vs. income) since so many older people have investments but live on little income. So, if you have wealth over a certain amount, your SS is 100% taxable or your Medicare is 20% higher is what I would expect since they already do both. So both income and expense will be squeezed.

My plan is to work on staying healthy and avoid contact with the medical / drug industry and to have contingency plans when SS is cut in 2032 (25%).  The important thing is to be knowledgeable and have a plan.",finance

personalfinance,IRS Lien Advice Requested,"Spouse and I could use advice on an IRS Lien. Throwaway b/c too much personal financial info. 

Basic info:

We owe approx. $ 64,000 in personal back taxes (2013-2017, we paid 2018 up). Approx. 50k base taxes and 14k penalties/interest. 

We received an approval letter dated August 19th from the IRS to make monthly $1,000 direct debit payments towards that starting Oct. 10th.  So we have a payment plan in place. The payment plan approval didn’t mention anything about a Lien being placed. 

After that I received a IRS 668Yc Notice of Federal Lien for 2013-2017 taxes (amount looks like it’s for the 50K basic taxes). The Lien itself says it was filed at the courthouse August 14th and the letter notifying us (certified) was dated August 27th. 

We just refinanced our house to get money out (60k) to pay off some of this as well as some high interest (some at 27%) credit card debt (approx. 45k).

Before we received the Lien the plan was to pay off taxes to get below 50k there and then use the rest to pay off all the credit cards. The Lien has become top priority instead because spouse travels outside U.S. for work and I understand they can take her passport (and further damage our credit rating).

We think we should request a “Collection Due Process” (CDP) hearing (form 12153) and we are thinking we should check “Withdrawal” (of Lien) on item 7 of that form rather than “Collection Alternative Installment Agreement” since we already have an approved installment agreement in place. 

Goal:

To spend the least amount getting the Lien removed (if possible) so we can spend the most on getting rid of the credit cards. We can make the $1000 a month IRS payment to pay off the rest just fine. (Also, we know “lawyer up” but if we do that is less money to spend on either taxes or credit cards.) We’d love to follow our original plan to get IRS debt below 50k, pay $1000 a month on that and use the rest of the house money to pay off all credit cards (hooray!). 

Questions:

Do we have any hope of getting the IRS to withdraw the lien if we get the total amount owed below  50k?  (And are making the $1000 a month payments in the future). 

If not, how about if we get total IRS debt below 25k (and unfortunately pay off fewer credit cards)?  

If either of the above will work, should I make the IRS payment to get below 50 or 25k before the CDP hearing or discuss it with IRS at CDP hearing first? 

Thank you for any advice.  Really appreciate it.",finance

* ""Rent"", utilities
* Food, beverage,
* Auto insurance, AAA, mobile phone, LifeLock

*Subtotal:* $400/month

Is there a right answer? How do I come to a decision?

personalfinance,Unsure of home buying price range &amp; which mortgage type I should look for to get the best interest rate &amp; any feedback on construction loans —Overwhelmed with home buying!,"I attended a first time homebuyers class recently for a better understanding of what buying a new home will involve but I feel kind of stupid for completing the class without knowing a ballpark range of what lenders will be willing to approve; many mortgages types covered in the class I don’t qualify for based on my finances:

Monthly household income: $12,333.00
Monthly debt including rent: $2800.00 
Down payment: $35,000

solar,"I saved $16,000 on my solar install by buying wholesale, applying the permit myself, and hired installers separately","**Update:** Someone recommended [https://www.dbmsolar.com/](https://www.dbmsolar.com/) for permits

**Summary:** My installer said my setup would have cost me $38k-40k(After contacting 20 installers, the price I usually got was around 30k) and that I made right decision doing it my way, which had an after tax cost of $22k (before federal tax credit). I basically bought the parts from a wholesaler and they guided me through utility and city permit process, then I hired an installer separately to complete the install. It's producing about 50kWh per day in SoCal sun.

**Cross posted here:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/SolarDIY/comments/d778sv/i\_saved\_16000\_on\_my\_solar\_install\_by\_buying/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SolarDIY/comments/d778sv/i_saved_16000_on_my_solar_install_by_buying/)

[Completed Install](https://preview.redd.it/w4vdc9tq6wn31.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e08730ed5f4e6bbcd896fb70858037b626cce5da)

I’ve always been interested in solar due to the long term cost savings and environmental impact. For 10 years, I would do a search every now and then and I would always get disappointed when it comes to the cost.

Everywhere I look, from reddit to other forums, people would say don’t go at it alone, it’s not easy. Then I found some people who purchased a kit and install part of it themselves (I didn’t lift a nail by the way). The 2 sites I found that offered kits were:

* [http://freecleansolar.com](http://www.freecleansolar.com/)
* [http://wholesalesolar.com](http://wholesalesolar.com/)

I wanted to get a pretty big system, about 10kW, turns out this is the biggest system you can get in Southern California without hiring an engineer to assess structural integrity of the house.

I wanted to get Enphase Microinverters because it would be easiest to determine if a panel isn’t working correctly and also, it looks pretty cool on the app seeing how much each panel is producing. Also from talking to many solar installers, it seems the Enphase system is the most reliable (one installer said 1 out of maybe 40 homes had an issue with a panel), while the SMA Inverters were usually not recommended.

I contacted both freecleansolar.com and wholesalesolar.co and compared their prices and the experience. I found that wholesalesolar.com had much better prices and the sales tech, Jeff Blick was extremely helpful throughout this entire process. The website was more user friendly as well and I read quite a few people had good experiences with them. The initial contacts with both companies were met with non-enthusiastic sales people, perhaps because they get so much business or tire kickers. But once they know you’re serious, and you’re connected with a Senior Sales Tech, it goes fairly smooth from there.

## Solar install steps

**Step 1 – Pick the solar kit:** Enphase is recommended, you can check their packages here: [https://www.wholesalesolar.com/shop/grid-tie-packages](https://www.wholesalesolar.com/shop/grid-tie-packages)

**Step 2 – Contact whole sale company:** In my case, contact the Sr. Sales Tech Jeff Blick jeff\[at\]wholesalesolar.com on the system you want (if you can, mention my name “KHOA” as the referrer). Don’t purchase the system yet, just get the Single Line Diagram for the utility application. Ask for a sales quote in PDF so you can show your installers the equipment you have. I recommend getting an Enphase Combiner box with your purchase to alleviate any headache, all solar installers asked for this, but my system didn’t have this, and I would have purchased it had I known.

**Step 3 – Utility application:** For Grid-Tie systems, you’ll need a utility company application, first you’ll need a single line diagram drawn (this is free from wholesalesolar.com, they’ll charge you $150 for it, but it’s applied to your entire system cost once you purchase). For Southern California Edison, here’s where you go to begin your application: [https://scenemsuccessortariff.powerclerk.com/](https://scenemsuccessortariff.powerclerk.com/)In my case, Southern California Edison is a bit of a pain to work with, but just have Jeff work with you on filling out the technical details, if you’re stuck at any process, just give them a call, they’re quite courteous, emailing Edison is not recommended.

**Step 4 – Solar plan:** Jeff recommended that I contact a separate company to get my plans drawn. In my case, it was [http://solarpermitservices.com/](http://solarpermitservices.com/). I paid $225 for this step, and $85 for a modification request. This company isn’t very responsive, I wanted Jeff to work with them but they were not very communicative, that’s what led to the $85 modification cost. I’d recommend finding another company if possible.

**Step 5 – Find installer on yelp:** After you get your solar plan drawn, use this plan along with the sales quote from wholesalesolar and send it to installers asking for a quote on the complete install. Here’s where you can save a lot of money, but you’ll need to contact many solar installers — I contacted over 20 roof AND solar installers and the quotes range from $2,900 for roof only to $12,000 for electrical and roof install. Yelp makes this very easy, you can ask multiple installers with one click of a button, eventually, you’ll have to contact one at a time because their system stops giving you multiple quote requests. Tell installers you’ve already got the city permit, utility permit (at pre-PTO stage), you’ll have all the equipment ready on site, and you’ll be ready to install in a month. All they need to do is install panels on the roof and the electrical. New companies or companies with open slots in their schedule are willing to bid on prices, so let them know you’re looking around. I got a company that went from $8,500 to $6,400 because they wanted the job bad, they were bidding against the lowest offer. Make sure the company is providing all the electrical equipment to complete the install (wiring, conduit, etc). So the quote should cover installation to PTO without any additional cost to you. Have at least 2 installers on stand by.

**Step 6 – City permit:** Once you find an installer that’s willing to give you a good price, you can start on the permit process, it should take only about a week. Search for “**\[YOUR CITY\] Solar Permit**” and start the application process! I’ve provided sample permit documents in the appendix. If you can’t find a good deal on an installer, keep on searching, and call around! If you really can’t find a good deal after this, at least you didn’t have inventory sitting in the garage like I did!

**Step 7 – Order solar equipment:** Once the city approves the install, now you can order the solar equipment.

**Step 8 – Install!** It should take about two weeks for the equipment to arrive, and the installer should take about 1.5 days for a three man team to install a 30 panel system.

personalfinance,IRS has been working on my return for 2.5 years,"California, USA

I filed my state and federal 2013 in 2017 within the 3-year deadline. My federal refund was large, 5 figures, due to an electric vehicle credit.

I had a situation with my former employer who gave me a signing bonus of $10,000. Taxes were withheld and the check I received was for $5,612.00. Neither the signing bonus nor the taxes were reported on my W-2. Is wage theft as sexy as tree law?

I spent about a year emailing back and forth with people in the company and they seem unable or unwilling to correct the situation. I contacted the Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division, they said they don't deal with things like this. I contacted the IRS, they said that they don't take reports about tax fraud (seriously). I contacted several other federal and state resources as recommended by the various departments I spoke with. Eventually, I ended up in a loop of referrals with every department directing me to a department that already said they wouldn't assist.

I gave up on the company fixing this and lost all faith in government enforcement of the law. I filed my taxes anyway so I wouldn't miss the statute of limitations on claiming a refund. Under the advice of the IRS, I

* filed my taxes using a 1040,
* a 4852 Substitute for Form W-2 that reported only the bonus at the full $10,000 and listed the various withholding amounts that I was provided with using an online calculator,
* an 8936 Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit,
* a 2106-EZ Unreimbursed employee business expenses (professional expenses, unrelated to the bonus),
* a 4562 Depreciation and Amortization (also unrelated to the bonus),
* a letter describing the situation, a image of the cancelled bonus check, calculations showing how I estimated the withholdings on the 4852, a copy of my employment offer that stated the signing bonus amount, proof of employment dates, and a printout from the online calculator that showed the estimated withholdings that matched the exact amount that was withheld,
* and, mailed to a different address, an 843 Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement.

Everything was mailed certified mail with return receipt. The return took many months to show up in the IRS system. Then I was not processed for a long time and IRS agents said they needed more time. Then after about a year, without notice, the IRS closed the file due to them claiming the taxes were filed many months past the SoL.

I remailed everything from above with an additional second letter now explaining why I was mailing them in again, the certified mail proof of mailing and the proof of delivery return receipt from the first submission of the taxes, the certified mail proof of mailing and the proof of delivery return receipt from the first submission of the 843, and a copy of the 843. The IRS agreed that I had submitted the taxes timely and started to process them.

Months went by and every several months I would receive a letter stating that the IRS needs more time to process the return. It's now been about a year since the resubmission and about 2.5 years since the mailing of the original submission and I still don't have my refund.

The IRS says to keep waiting. Nothing appears to be happening with my return. The IRS won't provide any details if the delay is because they are finally pursuing the company that.

1. I'm unsure if I will run into another timelimit that will allow the IRS to never issue my refund.
2. I'm unsure if I should file a form or letter to help expedite my refund.
3. I'm unsure if I should be contacting a CPA or attorney to handle this matter.
4. I have been issued a state refund but the refund amount was lowered due to the FTB removing the bonus paid and taxes withheld from the amount, should I contest this?",finance
stocks,Some interesting stories in the stock market this week,"The week began with the fall out from an attack by Iran on two oil facilities in Saudi Arabia that forced the Middle Eastern kingdom to shut down half of its oil production and sent oil prices and oil stocks soaring.  However on Tuesday Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman held a press conference pledging to fully restore crude production by the end of the month.  Oil prices and oil stock prices duly fell back sharply.  

That reversal seems excessive and, for me, the oil world remains a more dangerous place than it appeared to be eight days ago.  The attack is a significant escalation of what was previously primarily a war of words and, even with US troops being sent to support Saudi Arabia, it shows how vulnerable oil supplies in the region are.

However, that’s good news for US based producers such as Continental Resources and Occidental Petroleum who make significantly more cash flows if the oil price can be maintained above $60 rather than if they are just covering their costs.  The oil price remains a random variable but after last week’s attacks the risks appear to be on the up side.

&amp;#x200B;

**Value Stocks**

On Friday Goldman Sach upgraded its outlook for equipment rental stocks.  United Rentals rose 1% in response.  The reasoning behind the upgrade is the belief that equipment supply has peaked and rental rates are likely to bottom in coming quarters.  It’s a cyclical industry and growth is expected to slow however it is still expected to grow by 3% this year.  Longer term, the trend of customers switching from ownership to rental is expected to continue to drive strong growth.  Despite this equipment rental stocks trade at a big discount to other industrials. United Rentals trades for about 6 times estimated 2020 earnings. That looks cheap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growth Stocks**

On Wednesday Plug Power announced its strategic goals that included generating $1 billion of revenue and $200 million of adjusted EBITDA by 2024

That’s a big jump for the hydrogen fuel cell company (an increase of around 4x current year estimates) and I’m not entirely sure that it’s not partly wishful thinking.  But it cannot be denied that Plug has successfully reduced costs, found meaningful efficiencies and signed up key new customers including Amazon, Walmart and Fedex.

Perhaps the most interesting assertion in the release was that the $1 billion revenue target represents only 1% of its total addressable market.

Hydrogen cell technology looks like it has missed the chance to supply mainstream electrified cars but it still seems that there are plenty of opportunities in material handling for a small company like Plug (market cap $705 million).

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Situations**

Alder Biopharmaceuticals jumped over 85% to $18.62 this week after receiving a $20 offer from the Danish pharmaceuticals company Lundbeck. The offer includes an $18 up front cash payment and a further $2 payment if the migraine med eptinezumab is approved by the European Medicines Agency.

Alder plans to file for EMA approval next year and with 90% alignment between the US and European agency that $2 payment looks likely. Back of the envelope valuation, a 90% probability of a $2 payment would be worth $1.80 and discounting at 6% for 2 years would justify a price of around $1.60. Adding that to the $18.00 cash payment makes a stock price of $19.60 look fair.

&amp;#x200B;

**Large Caps**

Fedex’s sharp fall this week looks over done even though its problems are probably as much to do with dropping Amazon as a customer, near term capex requirements and poor historic acquisition choices as they are to do with the business cycle

Management’s decision to drop Amazon has to be the right one. Amazon is a competitor and the move will allow Fedex to replace Amazon with higher margin ecommerce business that will ultimately boost profits. Similarly elevated near term capital expenditures look justified as management balance near-term cash flow requirements with the need to invest to grow the business for decades to come. That can be seen with its aircraft fleet modernization plan that will pay off with significant efficiency gains over many years.  

FedEx has seen many economic cycles and industry challenges come and go. What investors need to recognize is that the firm is a leader in a duopoly that is seeing strong growth driven by ecommerce. The non-Amazon e-commerce field is fragmented, but provides a massive growth opportunity. Brie Carere, FedEx's chief marketing and communications officer, estimates that it will grow by 12% annually until 2026.

That makes the current $150 stock price look very cheap.  Even using the reduced guidance the valuation is just 12.5 times earnings. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Energy Stocks/Insider Buying**

On Wednesday,  McKinsey published its report on the ‘Global gas and LNG outlook to 2035’ which made a number of notable observations.  It said that the pace of growth in the gas market is set to slow, but natural gas will remain the fastest-growing fossil fuel and the only fossil fuel expected to grow beyond 2035. It also said that the United States is expected to account for more than half of the global natural gas supply growth through 2035. 

That’s good news for Kinder Morgan which operates the largest gas pipeline system in North America, transporting 40% of all the gas consumed in the U.S. its pipelines connect to every major supply basin and demand center.  Not only will the company see higher utilization of its legacy assets, but it will also be able to grow and build new infrastructure, especially in places such as Texas and Louisiana where it already has a large footprint.

Founder Richard Kinder said on a recent call “I believe that under almost any scenario, natural gas is a winner for years to come”.  He has backed up that optimism with $90 million of stock purchases this year.(KMI trailing PE 21 yield 4.8%).

&amp;#x200B;

**Highly Speculative**

Eros International Plc jumped 50% after announcing collaboration with Microsoft to develop a next generation online video platform.  The company has a NYSE listing and US address even though it was established in Mumbai over 40 years ago.  It is one of the leading film production and distribution companies in India and, with 11,000 movie titles, it has more local Indian content than both Netflix and **Amazon** combined.

However, since the announcement the stock has given up two thirds of its gains and it ended Friday trading on less than 6 times current year earnings estimates.  The reason being rumours of accounting irregularities.  

Now I cannot go into all of the details here except to say that there were short selling reports, a credit rating downgrade in June, a missed $2 million payment and a late filing.  Since then management has rejected the reports strongly, the small missed payment excused as inconsequential and a clerical error and the company has filed its audited annual report without any issues.  However, not surprisingly, the concerns are not easily dispelled and the stock (even after this weeks jump) languishes at a fraction of its previous valuation.

This is obviously not a stock for widows and orphans but the value proposition is as follows. Eros’ market cap at the close on Friday was $277 million.  Adding net debt of $60 million gives us Eros’ current total economic valuation at $340 million. Now the cost of making a film in Mumbai is not expensive, on average around $150,000, but replicating Eros’ portfolio of 11,000 titles would cost Netflix or Amazon about $1.65 billion.  Assuming a buyer is willing to pay 50% then Eros’ true value should be $825 million.  If that scenario came to pass then Eros’ stock price should rise 175%.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everybody. Some of the stocks mentioned above are highly speculative and risky. Please do your own research.",finance

*****
&gt; Developments in U.S.-Chinese trade talks and the comments from a host of Fed speakers could be important for markets in the week ahead, as stocks struggle to regain highs.
*****
&gt; The Fed in the past week cut interest rates for the second time in two months, but the latest forecasts of Fed officials showed just how divided they are on the need for future rate cuts. Five wanted deeper cuts, five didn’t want any cuts and another seven were happy with the Fed’s action.
*****
&gt; “The market seems like it’s pretty jumpy based on what the say. i think it would flip back and forth depending on how the headlines come out,” said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies. Simons said the focus will also be on the Fed’s operations in the short-term funding market, after turbulence in the overnight market in the past week temporarily sent some overnight rates sharply higher.

&gt; There are nearly a dozen Fed speakers on the calendar in the coming week, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is not scheduled to speak.
*****
&gt; Trade developments could continue to cause volatility in markets. Reports Friday that Chinese agriculture officials canceled visits to farms in Montana and Nebraska sent stocks lower, for fear it signaled that talks were not making progress.
*****
&gt; Stocks in the past week were lower, with the S&amp;P off about 0.5% to 2,992. The index had been around 1% away from its all-time high for a few weeks.
*****
&gt; “Tech that has been out of play and is acting faulty. it’s now turning into a headwind, and that could cause a problem for the bulls,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. “I haven’t seen so many mixed signals in the market in quite some time.”
*****
&gt; “It’s hard for the market to make new highs without tech. At best, it’s concerning when you see key names, like Amazon and Netflix, not just failing to lead but faltering,” he said. Netflix was down more than 8% for the week, and Amazon was off 2.6%.
*****
&gt; Redler said it was a concern that shares of market leader Microsoft gave up its initial gains and turned negative, soon after it announced a buyback and raised its dividend. “Strength was sold instead of embraced,” he said. “That was good news. What are they going to do when bad news happens?”
*****
&gt; Following the attacks on Saudi Aramco last week, the United Nations General Assembly in New York and meetings around it take on more importance for markets. U.S. and Saudi Arabian officials have said Iran was behind the attack, which knocked a significant amount of Saudi oil production off line. Iran has denied involvement, and Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility.
*****
&gt; Iran’ President Hassan Rouhani has been given a visa to travel to New York for the UN. Before the attack on Saudi Arabia last week, President Donald Trump had suggested he would speak to Rouhani but there seems little chance of that now. Oil have been highly volatile, with Brent crude futures up 7% since the attack as Saudi Arabia sought to assure markets that it would be able to bring its operations back on line.
*****
&gt; There is some economic data that will also be important to markets. There is manufacturing PMI Monday, important after ISM manufacturing data showed a contraction in August. Durable goods will also be important on Friday, as will personal consumption data, which includes the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator, the core PCE deflator.
*****
&gt; “What Powell said in his remarks was inflation was below his target,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “But even the core PCE deflator is expected to be 1.8, a new high for the year.” The Fed’s target inflation rate is 2%, and other inflation measures have been above that, including core CPI.
*****
&gt; The Fed will also be in focus after problems in the overnight funding market, used by banks in need of short term cash. Rates spiked for repo, or repurchase agreements, in a chaotic two-day period Monday and Tuesday. The Fed’s target fed funds rate also moved above its target range, in an unusual move.
*****
&gt; The market has since calmed after the Fed carried out open market operations to add liquidity to the market. On Friday, it announced three 14-day operations involving $30 billion as well as continued overnight operations of at least $75 billion each.
*****
&gt; “I think the Fed has absolute control over short term rates. It was caught sleeping at the wheel,” said Chandler.
*****
&gt; Powell said the Fed would monitor the market and take whatever action is needed. The market is considered the basic plumbing for financial markets, where banks who have a short-term need for cash come to fund themselves. The odd spike in rates was viewed as the result of a cash crunch, not a credit crisis.
*****
&gt; Bond market pros have been concerned that the Fed would again see strains in the market at month end, when there’s more activity in the overnight funding market.
*****
&gt; “It gets you further past quarter end,” said Jon Hill, rate strategist at BMO. “A 14-day pushes them further into October. I think nerves will have calmed. The fact you’ll see fed funds print clearly in the range will reassert confidence. These operations will serve as a reminder that the Fed can have absolute control the front end if and when it wants to. This is a good thing.”
*****
&gt; The funds rate was at 1.90% Thursday, within the target rate range of 1.75% to 2%.
*****
&gt; “They’re removing any doubt of their ability to take control of fed funds in the modern framework. They just announced $165 billion over quarter-end , and we may go bigger. They haven’t done a repo injection in 10 years,” said Hill.

# S&amp;P 500 down 23 of 29 during week after September options expiration, average loss 0.95%

&gt; The week after September options expiration week, next week, has a dreadful history of declines especially since 1990. The week after September options expiration week has been a nearly constant source of pain with only a few meaningful exceptions over the past 29 years. Substantial and across the board gains have occurred just three times: 1998, 2001, 2010 and 2016 while many more weeks were hit with sizable losses.

&gt; Full stats are in the following sea-of-red table. Average losses since 1990 are even worse; DJIA –1.02%, S&amp;P 500 –0.95%, NASDAQ –0.90% and a sizable –1.38% for Russell 2000. End-of-Q3 portfolio restructuring is the most likely explanation for this trend as managers trim summer losers and position for the fourth quarter.

# October Challenging in Pre-Election Years

&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in point and percentage terms. The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dcf589120968a5d6057ac1efe410ef3a/cc2da8936980c71c-4d/s400x600/f2a824e6445a02718474d46969d66c27a0fbfc79.jpg))**

&gt; Pre-election year Octobers are ranked second from last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ while Russell 2000 is dead last with an average loss of 1.9%. Eliminating gruesome 1987 from the calculation provides only a moderate amount of relief. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for depressed technology and small-cap shares.

# Where’s That September Volatility?

&gt; September is historically known as one of the worst for stocks, yet in 2019 the S&amp;P 500 Index is up 2.7% so far amid a sea of scary headlines. Incredibly, the S&amp;P 500 has wavered less than 0.1% from its previous close 6 of the past 10 trading sessions, as it consolidates just beneath all-time highs.

&gt; “Over the past two weeks we’ve had the European Central Bank meeting, the Federal Reserve meeting, higher inflation, a historic jump in crude oil, Middle East turmoil, trouble in the repo market, and even multiple NFL quarterbacks sustaining major injuries,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Yet, with all of those scary headlines, stocks are actually in the midst of one of the least volatile two-week stretches we’ve seen in years.”

&gt; We are quite encouraged by the overall change in market tone we’ve heard recently, with more cyclical names taking the baton and leading, but with the S&amp;P 500 up near our fair value target of 3,000, we would be on the lookout for this sea of tranquility to get rougher at any time. In fact, according to historical calendars, we may need to be on high guard for the second half of September.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, The Second Half of September Can Be Tricky For Stocks, later in the month of September is when we’ve seen seasonal weakness. Things have been going well for equities in the face of some worrisome headlines, but don’t get complacent, as the calendar could be one of the biggest near-term risks.

# The Fed Hits It Down The Middle

&gt; “History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes.” Mark Twain

&gt; As expected, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) policy committee cut its policy rate by 25 basis points (.25%) to a target range of 1.75%–2%. This comes on the heels of the first rate cut in more than 10 years at the end of July. This cut is somewhat more controversial, however, because the overall U.S. economic data has been improving, and there’s been a tick higher in inflation.

&gt; One of the most important questions heading into this meeting was how many voting Fed members would support additional rate cuts. There were two dissenting voting members at the July rate cut, and once again there were two votes opposed to today’s cut—but unlike last time, there was also one dissenter who favored a larger 50 basis point (.50%) cut. Materials in the economic projections indicated 10 of 17 participants (which includes non-voting members) did not believe additional cuts would be needed over the remainder of the year, although evolving economic conditions could certainly lead to a shift.

&gt; As the quote from Mark Twain suggests, by looking back at history we can potentially find clues as to what might happen in the future.

&gt; Looking back at the previous two recessions (2001 and 2008), the Fed cut rates 50 basis points (.50%) to kick off the new cycle of rate cuts. We looked back at what the Fed said at the time, and policymakers didn’t foresee a recession; the larger .50% cut might have been their way of showing how worried they really were at the time. In other words, maybe the Fed knew there potentially was trouble under the surface.

&gt; Compare this with three consecutive 25 basis point (.25%) cuts in the 1995/1996 and 1998 rate cut cycles, which led to continued equity gains and avoided recessions. Given we foresee one more cut this year, could it be another three cuts of 25 basis points (.25%) and then an economic acceleration?

&gt; “Here’s the catch. When the first two cuts in a new cycle of rate cuts are only 25 basis points, this could be the Fed’s way of truly viewing the cuts as insurance,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the past five cycles of cuts that started with two 25 basis point cuts saw the S&amp;P 500 Index move higher 6 and 12 months later every single time.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Stocks Have Historically Done Well If The First Two Fed Rate Cuts Are 25 Basis Points, the S&amp;P 500 was up an average of 9.7% six months after the second of two 25 basis point cuts to kick off a new cycle of rate cuts. Going out a year, the S&amp;P 500 had gained a very impressive average of 16.7%.

# Strong Start for September, but Second Half Could Bring Trouble

&gt; As of Friday’s close the market is well above historical average performance in September. DJIA was up nearly 3.1%, S&amp;P 500 was up 2.8%, NASDAQ and Russell 1000 were up 2.7% while Russell 2000 was up 5.6%. Small-caps outperforming large-caps recently is not unusual and they did so again today. However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&amp;P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 29 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.

# Broader Transports Still Outperforming YTD

&gt; With shares of FedEx (FDX) on pace for their second worst earnings reaction day since at least 2001, the Dow Transports, an index in which FDX has a weighting of over 8% (after today's decline), is down close to 2%. Historically, the Transports have been considered a leading indicator of the economy, so the weakness in FDX, and by extension, the Dow Transports, is resulting in heightened concerns over the state of the economy. Looking at the chart below, the picture for the Transports doesn't look pretty. The timing of today's decline couldn't have been worse as it came just as the Transports were attempting to break above the highs from July, but now it just looks like the second lower high this year. Following today's declines, the Dow Transports are up 14.7% YTD which is about five percentage points behind the performance of the S&amp;P 500.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091819-DJ-Transports1.png))**

&gt; Given the changes in the US economy over time, we've been skeptical of the continued predictive ability of the Transports, but even putting that aside for a moment, a broader look at Transports shows a less pessimistic picture. The chart below shows the performance of the stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 index on an equal-weighted basis so far in 2019. By this measure, today's decline comes after the index made a higher high, and while it's back below those former highs today, with a gain of 20.5% YTD, this broader look at transports is still outperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a YTD basis. It may not be a great picture for this group of transport stocks, but it doesn't really look bad either.

personalfinance,"Discovered that I did not include ~$11,000 of income on my 2016 tax return","As stupid as this may sound, I just discovered that I did not include approximately $12,000 on my 2016 tax return. I basically worked for a company as a contracted employee for the first few months and then got hired on full time. I am currently working on amending my tax return from 2016 and will be mailing it in this weekend. Am I going to get in a lot of trouble for failing to report so much income? Also, is it likely that the state and federal taxes can be put on payment plans? It's showing I owe around $3,500 federal and $600 state.",finance

Since I'm unable to do that, I'm wondering if it's possible I use a private or Federal loan to pay that off and then use the balance of said loan to cover the semester as well. I can't find any info online to find the answer and my school is slow to come back with an answer.",finance
personalfinance,The US is more expensive to be self-employed than Canada,"The US is only marginally more beneficial in the much higher tax brackets.

Medicare / SS also really dig in to income. Im self employed so im paying the full amount (15.3%). Medicare has no cap. SS tax is capped at around $150k USD income. Canadian equivalent CPP is capped at around $5000 CAD (total payable) for self employed.

As a self employed person living in Michigan I calculated:

Income Tax savings $3836 CAD on $100k CAD income


Income Tax savings $8147 CAD on $150k CAD income

These savings are immediately a wash as I must also pay for private health insurance. A non-income tax state would boost tax savings by 4.25%. 

Im going to run some ideas past an accountant and see his advice but living on the US side doesn't save a whole lot. Sure the sales tax is lower, but Im not a big consumer so this really doesn't affect me.

personalfinance,Would taking out a personal loan from my bank be a good idea?,"Hey all,

I'll briefly summarise my situation to give some context:  
I  work full time in a ridiculously expensive area in the North of  England. Rent and council tax along eat up over two thirds of my wage (I  can't downsize, I live in a studio flat). I have found another job in a  small town where my new rent will be less than half of what it is now,  however I am struggling to cover the fees (holding fee, first month and  deposit etc).

I have £5.71 in my main bank account.

I  have £550 on credit card, and can't do a money transfer into my main  account (the estate agents only accept payment from debit cards).

I  realistically only need to borrow £2000. With this I will pay my credit  card off and get my debt all in one place, and the left over money I  will use to pay for my new place and van hire, and then bank and repay  the remainder.

I am currently with  Lloyds, and their interest rate is around  27.1%APR  which varies  slightly depending on the length of the loan.

A  friend has offered to lend me some money, however I don't want to take  it because I don't like to sap off friends. Also, the person who has  offered to lend me money will hold this over my head as an obligation to  him (after I have payed him back) for the rest of my life and I can't  be arsed with that.

I know full well that I will be a **lot** better off when I get to this new area, but it's just getting there.

So the money that normally got me through the school year just doesn't cut it anymore and now I need to look at loan options. My freshman year I was forced to take out a loan from a bannk because the dorms were super expensive, and I was lucky enough to have my grandmother to cosign for me. Now since she has passed I have nobody that will cosign for me, and my mother will not let me take out a parent plus loan. I have done some research and can't find many more loan opportunities where the interest rate isn't through the roof and that I will not need a cosigner for. Basically everyone in my family has terrible credit and the only person who doesn't, my grandpa, will not cosign with me. I also have no credit myself other than renting a place because I have never had a card. Any advice on a different way to get by this?

personalfinance,Recently got a credit card and trying to build credit,"I turned 21 this year, so I got my own credit card. It has an 11.9% interest rate and $900 limit, and I get $25 cash back on every $2,500 spent.

I've been an authorized user on my dad's credit card for a few years now, which has made my credit score look pretty decent (~750). I've heard that this isn't as great as it seems, since lenders will see that it's just from being an authorized user. My hope is that this new credit card will help me build my own credit because, before too long, I may look into getting a mortgage for a house.

I'm using it for purchases pretty frequently, mostly groceries. I don't want to pay any interest on the card, so I've been transferring money to it in anticipation of using it, essentially as if it were a debit card. On Credit Karma, it says I have a 0% utilization rate because of this, I think. Will this hurt my score? Bear in mind that I've had this card only a few weeks, so maybe that has something to do with it.

business,"Should I buy my business partner out of our jointly owned rental property for the cash flow, or should I just sell it with him and literally pay off all of my debt?","Man my money stuff is all over the place recently.

I am in Ontario, Canada.

So, a business partner and good friend I bought my second rental property with had a bit of a mental and emotional breakdown due to unrelated, mostly work...stuff. He is very much under the impression that he does not like having the responsibility of rental property, and just wants to purge all of his stressors now. I have tried to talk him out of it, as it is a fairly good cash-flow generating property that we could just literally give to a property manager if we didn't want to actually deal with the day to day stuff, and I also don't want him to be making big financial decisions when he's mentally compromised, but he's pretty adamant that he's thought it through and just wants out. I've definitely done my friend due diligence, and asked him to at least wait a few months, but he's come back with the same opinion even stronger after a month.

**This situation leaves me with two fairly compelling options for myself. Either I buy out his share of the property, or I just let it be sold and also reap the rewards.**

So a bit more of the financial situation:

\-The house has about $130000 left on the mortgage, purchased 3 years ago for $189000

\-We can assume that if we were to sell it today, it would sell around $260000 to $300000.

\-I'm not sure how much legal/closing/etc costs would be if we did sell it, but on our preliminary call he estimated we'd probably get something like 50k each after everything was said and done. I've never actually sold a house, i honestly don't know.

\-I have about $30000 saved up currently, as well as $25000 in PLCs, which if I did have to dip into to buy my partner out would have an interest rate of 6.something%. I believe I could also work out a payment plan with him within reason, so long as it ends before the end of the current fiscal year, as he just wanted to put the money into his tax free allowances.

\-The current rent at the property is $1450+836= $2286, one of the tenants is slightly behind, but he will catch up. I think when we did our taxes last year, the profit margin per person after expenses was something like $6000, but that should be higher now as the rent on the upstairs apartment increased by about $200.

\-I personally save about $3000-$4000 every month, and this would presumably increase that $500-$800, though all of that would immediately go into paying off the PLCs that I would dip into immediately, leaving likely cash poor for about 6-9 months.

**If we did sell it all together, my other debt is a mortgage on my first rental property for $68000, which I would essentially be able to pay off outright, leaving me with no debt, and an extra $450 in monthly cash flow, as well as about $350000 worth of assets which at 27 is pretty attractive. As useless as having home equity at a younger age actually is (unless you can show enough income to have a good HELOC which I can't.)**

**On the other hand, I like being fairly diversified, and having 5 apartments bringing in money is definitely better than having 3, though I'm not sure if it's worth taking on the extra $65000 of mortgage, as well as $50k(+) of buyout costs on myself. Though, when those are both paid off in 2-4 years, that is like $650000 in assets. Not including future equity gain, which frankly I don't think is going to be crazy fast, but I could be wrong?**

**That being said, while my savings rate is pretty great, the way that I do make money wouldn't allow me to qualify for a mortgage that size on my own if I wanted to expand later (rental income, airbnb, part time work, other smaller entrpreneurial stuff...I'm definitely underemployed, but I have been making it work with pluck and gusto.)**

**Selling it would decrease my cash flow from my current state around $500-800 per month, but increase it by about $450 when i consider the money i would be able to unlock from having the other mortgage paid off. Buying him out would increase my cash flow $500-800, but with the added costs of the entire mortgage as well as the buy out costs/ potential PLC interest. After everything is paid off, that is a difference of $12000-$19200 per year, though this would lock me into the two houses as my major debt expenditures over the next 2-4 years. I did want to buy something else for myself to actually stay in, but either way, I think that might be a few years off so its a moot point (wouldn't be able to get a decent mortgage in selling situation so I would have to save a fairly substantial down payment, and I would need to pay down debt aggressively and save a down payment to get a decent mortgage in the keeping situation.)**

**What is the smart move here? I honestly don't know. I'll take other creative suggestions as well!**

TL;DR- Literally the title. Should I buy my partner out of our jointly owned rental property for the cash flow, or should I just sell it with him and literally pay off all of my debt with the current equity gained?",finance
personalfinance,"USA, 25 y/o, 611 score, approx. $10,000 in very bad debt. Just want to get my life together.","Hey ya'll.   


I'll put together all the information I've got, please ask if anything else is needed. I've made stupid decision after stupid decision starting around 19 and it's quickly gotten out of control. 

I'm 25 years old and live in the southern US. My credit score is 611 according to creditkarma.  


I just got a new job where I'm salaried and make $52,946.40 annually. I take home $1458.21 bi-weekly. I'm eligible for quarterly bonuses which average anywhere from $500-$1100 depending on performance (believe me, I try my absolute best but it's not totally controllable.) I spend approximately $40 in gas to get to and from a week. I work anywhere from 50-65 hours a week. I bonused last quarter and expect around $700 on 10/11's paycheck.  


I bought a new car a few years back and now only owe $2100 more. I pay $334 a month for the vehicle.  


I run about a $300 phone bill, and $90 cable/internet bill. Less than $100 in other recurring monthly fees I pay for various services. I would like to give back 2 of the 3 devices on this plan that I got when I (thought) was in a better spot, but I can't give them back without $175 early termination fees. Without those two my bill would go down to about $110.  


My power bill runs $120 as it's very hot still now. Will go down to about $80 as it gets colder.  


I rent an apartment for $850/mo. I would move back in with my parents if it were feasible but it isn't. My girlfriend does not want to move into this apartment with me and split the costs. (Don't blame her) This was the cheapest option I could find when I was forcibly voted out of my old house by the other 3 roommates. I am month-to-month right now and signing a lease would only bring it down to $750.  


When times got tough at 3 separate points over the last 18 months I was insanely stupid and resorted to pay-day/high interest loan companies for temporary bailouts that are now biting me in the ass. They are as follows:  


Loan Company 1 - $4318 owed, $172/mo, $7700 if I only make minimum monthly payments.  
Loan Company 2 - $1986 owed, $175/mo. Balance essentially stays the same if only the minimum payment is made.  
Loan Company 3 - $3400 owed. $336/mo, gets much worse if I only make minimum monthly payments (you have to call them to find out, it's not listed.) This is by far the worst loan in terms of interest rate and monthly payment.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a credit card that was closed with a balance of $635. Debt collectors are very actively trying to recover this from me, but I don't have the extra cash at the moment. I planned to use some of my upcoming bonus to settle or pay this off completely. (Unless the better option is to continue to ignore it for now.)  


I have one active credit card that I have used $270 of the $300 limit. I make a $25 payment every now and then to keep it open.  


I served 6 years in the Army National Guard (if that's important, don't know if that helps me).  


My expenses per month usually outweigh what I bring in unless my parents help me in the limited amount they can. Other than that I use /r/borrow loans about once a month to get me by to the next paycheck, but obviously that puts me in an even worse hole usually.  


I'm confident I could scratch, claw, and side work my way out of the majority of my debt and start building a savings if I could get even 1 or 2 of those bad loans paid off. I'm also super worried that my now 6 year old and out of warranty car is any day away from a major mechanical issue that would sink me. I badly want to build a savings to avoid something like this.  


What do I do? I've attempted to get loans so that I could pay off the predatory loans and get those payments all under one roof at a lower interest rate, but my credit is so bad and I've tried too many times at this point that I don't get approved.  


Sorry for the wall, any help or advice is greatly... greatly appreciated. I'm a horrible (personal) budgeter and I often impulsively buy things for myself (phone bill great example) to feel even a glimpse of happiness for a day or two before I crash back down to earth.",finance

personalfinance,I thought IUL was a scam... but it might actually be worth it? (Compared to S&amp;P 500 Index Fund),"Hi all,

tl;dr: I've compared S&amp;P 500 Index Funds with a S&amp;P 500 Index Fund-based IUL, and found that the IUL policy is actually worth buying?! What is wrong with my calculations and am I blinded by some caveats that I'm not seeing?!

I've done some calculations on an IUL insurance policy that I was offered, and I want to see if I've done anything wrong and **would like you guys to comment/refute my calculations** (much, much appreciated!!). I have been told multiple times that IUL insurances are basically scams due to high fees, but since the fees are fixed: when you invest funds high enough, it can actually have a strong growth? (As strong as S&amp;P 500 Index Funds). I was very surprised when I saw the result, too.

Assumptions:

* Initial fund is $100,000 dollars for 10 years. We do not put in anymore money before withdrawal.
* The IUL policy tracks S&amp;P 500; highest capped at 13% and lowest floored at 0.75%.
* Fees = insurance policy based on my age, which is \~= $3,500 a year.
* Due to tax code 7702, **gains are tax-free**.
* My regular income tax rate is about 34% (state + federal).

For comparison, I found some Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Index Fund with expense ratio 0.04%--and it turns out that the IUL policy might be more worth it than S&amp;P 500 Index Fund?!

See my calculations here:  [https://imgur.com/a/G3ViMMG](https://imgur.com/a/G3ViMMG)

Notice that I have a column ""Geico Life"" that I currently set at 0%. For the IUL  policy,  if I die or get major illnesses, I receive up to $2 million US dollars. I've found a similar life insurance policy costing only about $300 / year. Feel free to set ""Geico Life"" to 0.3% (300 / 100,000) to make the comparison more accurate.

Overall, due to my **tax rate, large enough fund,** and **recent market not performing as well**, it seems like the IUL policy is actually worth investing?! Especially that my tax rate might increase 10 years from now. What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

*Edit:* Updated my calculations

[https://imgur.com/a/zJ41PnX](https://imgur.com/a/zJ41PnX)

This time with real number and carried-over funds year-to-year per everyone's suggestion. And IUL seems to be working even better?!! WHAT

I also added a 1% increase for my premium (fee) each year, assuming aging would lead to increase? But I'm not sure what exactly the fees are and I'll find out and update.

&amp;#x200B;

*Edit #2:* Thanks to SAugsburger, I believe the **2% dividend is what makes the difference!** I believe most IULs keep out the dividends from their calculations and essentially adding this 2% as a hidden fee D:

datascience,How do predictive models such as ANN differ against models such as graph models?,"Graph models as in models based on graph theory (e.g. nodes and edges). 

I'm trying to make sense on how models such as neural networks differ from a graph model, especially in a predictive sense.

In **ANN**: 

* 'features' are basically represented as some numbers, say 0-1 (e.g. width of height of some flower), or just some labels 
* these input values are fed through one or more hidden layers where these hidden layers have some activation functions (i.e. making linear values to non-linear) and send the output to an output layer. 
* depending on the applications, ANN can be either a classification or regression problem solving approach. 
* the more data you have, the better the accuracy.
* but overtraining the data can cause overfitting making the model inaccurate in a non-linear world.
* but ANN doesn't necessary need a ""relationship"" between the features.

In **graph models/ graph theory**:

* 'features' are basically represented as nodes and edges. 
* e.g. Stock value (a node) is impacted (an edge) by the negative sentiments coming from China (another node).
* as the network grows (i.e. more countries are added to the network), the distance between the nodes grows.
* assume: the further away a foreign country (i.e. a node) is to the US, the lesser impact it has to the US's economy.
* using some calculations, we can now make some reasonable forecasting i.e. to what degree a foreign country would impact the US economy based on the graph distance. 
* in a sense, large data are not needed as no training is required.

What I got from here:

**ANN**: 

* Needs large data.
* Overfitting may occur.
* Doesn't need a relationship between the features.

**Graph**:

* Doesn't need large data.
* May not have overfitting scenarios (not too sure about this one)
* Needs a relationship between the features (in a sense ...)

I'm not too sure really. Any views, input or others are so welcome!",technology

TLDR: Inflation is creating huge inequalities and bubbles. The money supply in Sweden is doubling every 10 year, savings are wiped out. The people near the source benefit greatly, the poor get the money after inflation has hit. The American FED is the drummer, so to speak, in this race to the bottom. 

My take on this, and why I got into Bitcoin: Inflation is a tax on the poor, practically enslaving the poor to the banks. Bitcoin is non inflationary, sound money for the people. The elite who get their power from inflation stand to lose their power to create money out of nothing if people can just opt out of fiat money.

personalfinance,Question about paying back student loans &amp; taxes,"New physician here.

~105k left in student loans for undergrad and medical school spread out over 6 loans with interest rates varying from 4.5 - 6.55%. 

Make ~ $15k take-home pay per month in a salaried position for now. Live in a moderately expensive area in California with rent + utilities + food/gas costs of about 4k per month. Girlfriend contributes a little bit but she doesn't make very much.

I'm not sure I'm going to stay in this position for more than a year or two and would like to use that time to knock out as much in my loans as possible. I'm fortunate to have ~10k per month in disposable income. I have ~15k in savings currently, which I think would be enough to cover a potential catastrophe.

I'd like to basically throw most of the $10k each month to loans, paying off the higher interest ones first and working down. The worry I have is getting screwed on taxes next year. I filed 0 allowances, single, no dependents and am not anticipating filing any deductions on either CA or federal taxes. Is putting all of my disposable cash into loan payment the best way to go?

personalfinance,Should I invest my savings to paying off the mortgage early?,"Hello. Thanks for the help ahead of time.  Sorry for any inconsistencies English is not my first language. The gist of it: I have around $110,000 saved in a regular Bank of America savings account. They are just sitting there not growing much except from what I add myself every month. 

I owe 204,000 on my mortgage with a fixed 5.375% Interest rate for 30 years and I pay 1,756 for my monthly payment. That includes fees, taxes, escrow balance, HOI etc etc. No HOA if that matters. Personally I think that is an outrageous mortgage payment. Of those 1,756 only about 243 go to my principal balance and 915 a month alone goes to interest.  Again to me that is outrageous. In my head I think I could use the money I have saved up to take advantage of the low interest rates available now to refinance and bring down the balance of the house way down.  My credit is not the best to be honest, 640-630 were the last numbers I checked so I do not expect my interest rate on my refinance to go down much, but the drop in the amount owed would give a great reprieve to my finances.

I work with the government and make around 80-85,000 a year.  Have no kids, only owe about 1,000 in Student Loans, 6,000 on car loan and no credit card debt etc etc. So besides the mortgage I don’t really have any outrageous debt. Also have a partner I live with but we keep our finances separate. 

By bringing the payment way down I could save up around $35,000 a year alone every year to add to the mortgage and pay off the house in no more than 3 year from now. After the house is paid off. I could save even more, and with regular expected raises at work I could be saving close to $50,000 a year so I could expect to recover the money I invest in the house in around 5 years or maybe less. (My partner and I might get married soon, she makes around 34,000 a year now, but is about to obtain her RN license.  That would start her at $55,000+ a year. When we get married we would combine our finances to pay off the house/save  even faster)

Does this seem like a sound financial plan, or am I just crazy? Should I be maybe spending that money on something else? 

If it matters I have a major disease, and although I am healthy right now at any point I could become disabled unexpectedly and be unable to work for all of my life. That is why I am so focused on paying off the mortgage and at least securing a house for myself. Can’t pay the mortgage if I am bedridden...",finance

I'm currently an O-2 in the Army, in a year or so I'll hit O-3. At this point I am unsure if I want to stay in the military or pursue a different path entirely. I enjoy the benefits/pay, but I find the lifestyle unrewarding and restrictive. If I leave, I will have full access to the GI Bill(Military did not pay for my education). I have an English degree from a good public university so it wouldn't translate to any particular job on the outside. If I left the military, I would have no desire to work in any position related to the federal government. Right now I am attempting to save money up for an extended round trip around the world if I did leave the military which I know sounds ridiculous, but I'm a big fan of traveling(hostel/backpacker lifestyle) and have a strong desire to do this while still young and healthy.

My main questions are this.

Should I start maxing my Roth 401k contributions? Should I be contributing to Roth or Traditional?

I would need to contribute an extra 861 per month to be able to max the contribution yearly. My main worries about this are that I am unfamiliar with what would happen if I want to withdraw the money before I am old. Can I even withdraw it before I am 59 and a half or would there be major penalties? I know most advice will lean towards don't touch your retirement funds at all until you are old, but I am having difficulty at this moment thinking that far in the future!

What should I start investing in with the money in my savings account?

My TSP and Roth IRA at this point both have highly aggressive allocations(Pretty much all stocks) because I'm still young. I recently took out a loan for 25k (0 percent interest), do you suggest I spend roughly 15,000 of it or so and put it into a Vanguard VTSAX fund? I am willing to take risks at this point with my money. I can also pay the entire balance of the loan back.

Any advice on what I should focus on with my finances since I am unsure of what I want to do in my near future?

The problem is they do not provide any federal student loans, and I do not have any money saved up for living and food expenses if I were to get in. I would have to take out private loans. I currently have a loan from sallie mae that is almost $11,000, with an interest rate of 8-9%. So I do have experience with private loans. The next cheapest program is 42,000. There is another program that is 40,000, but it also does not offer federal student loans only private. In addition, I have heard bad reviews from others in the field that program A is not a good program. I really want to be properly educated so I can perform well.

On a different note,  I would get started in my field quicker if all went well, and it could be cheaper.

personalfinance,Should we use some of my husbands money to pay off my credit card debt?,"Hi there PF. I’m a 30 year old woman, living in Canada. I’ve been with my husband for seven years, although we just got married this summer. Like a lot of people my age, I’ve wracked up a bit of credit card debt. This was due to a number of factors, including being young and dumb, going to grad school and intermittent unemployment (I’ve moved around the country a bit). My husband has no credit card debt and no school debt, even though he has an undergrad and a masters degree. This is because his parents are quite wealthy and paid for all of his schooling. His parents also contributed to the wedding and have let us know they will help us buy a house in the future. My parents are totally middle class, but I was on my own paying for school, which is what helped contribute to my credit card. It’s been at 9,000 for the past few years, with me throwing money at it where I could, but it’s been hard to pay it off because I was in grad school and then paying for a wedding. My interest rate is 11.99%.


My husband has about 63,000 in an account that his parents started for him when he was young, which has money invested into different stocks, and some of it in a tax free savings account with high interest. Our plan was to use some of this money to buy a house in the next few years. His parents have also told us they will give us an additional 30,000 when we decide to buy a house. I’ve always considered my credit card debt my burden to bear, but my husband recently brought up that maybe we should use part of the money he has in this account to pay off my credit card. We’re just not sure if this is a good use of the money? Or if it’s better to try and maintain that account. We don’t really make very much money (we both work in the arts &amp; culture industry), so this account feels like a lot of money to us and we are nervous about touching it. Right now my husband has a 50,000/year job, and I just started a job where I’m paid 35,000 (plus benefits and pension for the first time in my life).",finance

This time, however, we were notified during month 6 of the pregnancy that the birthing center would be closing their birthing services 2 weeks prior to our expected date.  The birthing service and location would now be 2 blocks west at the city hospital.  We were told and promised time and time again that the billing at the new facility would be the same as the billing at the old center.  My wife continued to tell me this information as she was fed it from the birthing center.  I had my doubts and had her convinced the same.  There was, however, little we could do except await the billing.  

The time came and the birthing center closed up their services, and our son was born a week later.  According to plan, we birthed at the brand new hospital birthing center.  We had the exact same services as we had with our prior 2 births.  Everything was identical except for the location.  All in all, we were in the facility a grand total of 7.5 hours from check in to driving out the door.

Billing Time   
As expected, we received a billing for all services included from both the birthing center and the hospital.  What we had been told from the birthing center didn't happen, and all in all we were now being billed for over $12,000 worth of hospital provided services all lumped into 3 single charges.  We were confident that within these 3 sets of charges were multiple bogus charges that would be ""standard"" for everyone.  The trouble for the hospital was that our birth was far from standard.   No doctor, no nursery, no medications, nothing.  The hospital however, confirmed to us that their birthing services were also based on a set package - inclusive of medications, meals, and a 2+ typical day.  

To make the 2 1/2 month story short - when we received the bill we requested an itemized billing of services.  Not just the ""nursery fee"" or the ""facility charge,"" but the actual itemized bill that they would have submitted to insurance.  Once we made this request, the hospital put our accounts on ""hold pending review.""  After multiple weeks, we were finally called with notification that the hospital had finally finished their review.

Result
The hospital declined to provide an itemized bill.  
The hospital declined to explain anything more than the 3 single prior billing batches.  
The hospital did offer a 55% reduction in billed services ""post-insurance.""  Since we had already hit our deductible, this was rather huge for us.  The hospital kept their billing of 12k to the insurance, however they offered us a massive discount in what they called a ""courtesy credit.""  This courtesy credit was applied post deductible and in the end was $2,200.  When we cover this portion at the 20% co-insurance rate, this equates to an equivalent  billing of $11,000 to the insurance.  Granted, we can debate about the exact equivalent and how it applies post insurance.  But the fact remains, we worked with the hospital to reduce our portion of the bill by 55%.  

It worked in our favor this time - and we hope it works in your favor as well.",finance

My question is, should I hustle to pay off my loans as fast as possible (living in shitty cheap apartments, pay $1000 extra each month towards my loans) or should I take my time and just pay it off in maybe 8-10 years by paying minimum payments on my loans(and maybe plus more from whatever extra money I have) and live in a nicer apartment? Being an engineer over the years will probably land me a higher and higher salary so should I be cheap and struggle or take it easy and enjoy life as a new engineer after being beat down by the discomfort of school/poor college student life for the past 4 years?

btc,Bakkt Bitcoin Launch Today! What are your thoughts?,"So, everyone is talking about Bakkt, but what is BAKKT exactly, and why do institutional companies and big players in the cryptocurrency space finds their launch so important?

Bakkt is a futures exchange and a digital assets platform launched by the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE and the brainchild of the New York Stock Exchange. The owners — Jeffrey Sprecher a Wallstreet Giant and currently the chairman of NYSE and his wife, Kelly Loeffler CEO of Bakkt.

The goal is to make Bitcoin mainstream. The main idea is to provide institutions and traditional investors the chance to buy and sell digital assets in a US federal environment, which are now all made possible as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or CFTC has finally approved of its launch after nearly a year of delays and false starts.

As Bakkt’s main goal is to provide mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies in the future, it is enabling huge and small types of institutions, merchants, and consumers alike, access to digital assets by providing a secure and trusted ecosystem through their platform.

To attain this, Bakkt has developed its very own digital asset infrastructure that focuses on Custody, Markets, Payments, and Compliance.

Let us go over each of these and find out what Bakkt has to offer.

**Custody**

Ironclad protection is essential in any type of investment vehicle or asset class be it on stocks, bonds, mutual funds or in Bakkt’s case, Bitcoin and digital currencies.

Bakkt has then piggybacked their technology on Intercontinental Exchange’s technology — to ensure the top-most security of their digital assets storage.

Warm and Cold wallet storage has been built, but the majority of the Bitcoins, will be stored in a cold wallet storage warehouse, that is Air-gapped, equipped with state-of-the-art bank-grade security vaults, stored, at the deepest of the deep vaults disconnected from the web.

The fortress-like protection installed by Bakkt for the owner’s wallet, would then require wallet keys to be sharded and then encrypted upon creation. This would, in turn, require multiple key-shards to sign a single transaction as an added layer of security.

To request for a withdrawal or transfer, the bitcoins must then leave the Cold storage warehouse then move to warm storage via electronic transfer over the internet.

**Payments**

The goal is to make Bitcoin mainstream. The main idea is to provide institutions and traditional investors the chance to buy and sell digital assets in a US federal environment, which are now all made possible as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or CFTC has finally approved of its launch after nearly a year of delays and false starts.

This is something that Bakkt owners Loeffler and Sprecher aims to change in collaboration with Starbucks, one of the world’s biggest food company. With the use of Bakkt Application (Bakkt Pay), users could then convert their bitcoins to dollars using their mobile phones. This would, in turn, result in a 75% reduction in transaction costs compared to payments made directly via Bitcoin.

**Markets**

Bakkt meets regulatory standards for digital asset markets and is accessible by qualified market participants in the US and across the globe.

In their website it says:

&gt;We’re partnering with ICE’s leading futures exchange and clearing infrastructure to bring physically delivered futures contracts to market participants around the world. Participants undergo applicable AML/KYC reviews, consistent with CFTC-regulated markets and connect via ICE’s existing infrastructure.

As everyone is getting excited, and all hyped on the official launch of Bakkt, we do expect critics on the opposite side of the spectrum. Its critics say that Bakkt’s platform defeats the entire purpose of Bitcoin which is the decentralization and eradication of intermediaries to promote a more transparent financial system.

Let us all stand by for the countdown, as we all witness the launching of the moonshot vision of Bakkt.",cryptocurrency

I bought my home here in San Diego for 525,000 at 4.5 interest rate (my credit wasn't too good). It's a home in Spring Valley that sits on a 1/3 of an acre. I initially put down 10 percent, and within 2 years, got that percentage up to 16 percent. I made an principal only payment for 35000 in my first year, which helped a lot.. I should have got a recast on my mortgage at that time, but I didn't know what that was until recently. So... Now, I the 2 year mark this part August and I was eligible to remove the PMI. The PMI is roughly 550 dollars. I make roughly a 3600 dollar payment each month. My LTV percentage is currently at 84.5 percent. My prior mortgage service company was quicken loans and now it's loancare llc. I was told by them that if I wanted to remove the PMI that I had two options: Pay down to reach 80 percent LTV or get an appraisal that shows you're at 75 percent LTV. The appraisal cost is $580.

As title states, my wife and I were recently given a very generous and unexpected gift of $5,000. 

We have roughly $14,000 in credit card debt spread across two cards: $3,500 on a MC; $9,000 on a Discover. Both cards have equally absurd interest rates. We were suckered into these cards at a younger age and just have never been able to pay them off completely and get rid of them. The Discover interest rate is 21.9%. Yes, you read that right. The MC’s is also 21%. (Previous edit had incorrrect info) 

We had considered going to our bank and applying for a small loan at a lower interest rate to pay off both cards at once, and then pay off the bank loan. Now that we have this sudden influx of money, we’re considering paying off the MC at once, saving the remaining $1.5k, and figuring out another way to pay off the Discover. 

Other than these credit cards, we own a home and two cars, all of which we are in good standing. 

Thoughts here? How should we best utilize this $5k to help pay down our credit card debt?

Thank you very much in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Relative pay stuck at Minimum Wage for nearly ten years!,"PERSONAL FINANCE ISSUE:  How do you survive financially if all the jobs you can do don't raise your pay on a scheduled basis?

I had an interesting conversation with a relative at a family event.  He is low key, simple-minded nice guy with a very low IQ and no communications skills.  A South Carolina resident who works in Fast Food.  He likes his job (believe it or not!) and his coworkers and boss treat him fairly, so he does not go to another employer.  He has been there for about ten years!

I was nosy and asked him how much money he made working at the fast-food restaurant.  He said $7.25 an hour.  I was shocked to find out that in ten years he has not got a raise.  (South Carolina has not raised it's state minimum wage and goes with the Federal Minimum Wage which last increased in July 2009.  It sits at $7.25 an hour.  It would cost $8.67 today to buy the same basket of goods $7.25 would have cost in 2009.  So his $7.25 an hour wage has actually gone down in the last ten years since he started in 2009 in real dollars.

I asked him why he does not move onto another employer and he said the jobs in fast food in his hometown all pay $7.25 an hour and no one gets a raise no matter how long they stay unless he/she is promoted.  He is not a manager or has any supervisory skills.   He is a worker, not a leader.

I see it as a logical step for Amazon to take and I see FedEx as having a big headstart in terms of size of fleet. The advantage Amazon has is their own business, which serves as a baseline gauranteed shipping volume. From there they could start expanding on the service and offer to other companies.

The big question is whether a company dedicated to shipping can withstand the threat of a newcomer and use their current size to their advantage.

personalfinance,Some debt mysteriously disappeared. Should I call a collections company to see if I owe them money?,"Long story short, I was in an out-of-state hospital earlier this year as a John Doe. They didn't have my insurance info or mailing address during intake - though I provided it during my stay.

Months later I found out that they effed up their records and didn't record my mailing address correctly, and had been sending the bill to the wrong address. Since I didn't reply, they sent it to a collections agency.

So the next day I called the collections agency and they say that they did have a bill for me - but they were just notified that the mailing address was wrong, so they sent it back to the hospital. At this point I call the hospital, receive access to an online billing portal where I can see my statement, and set up a payment plan.

Only weird thing is, I can see my original statement that they sent to the wrong address, and it lists that I owe about $1.5k more than what the hospital's billing portal says I owe (and what my most recent statement says I owe).

So I feel like what must have happened is that the hospital sent my bills to collections in bits and pieces, and somewhere in the shuffle $1.5k worth of bits and pieces got lost...

It has been about 3 months since I finally received my bill and set up a payment plan. I have not received a bill for an additional amount from the hospital, and I have not heard from the collections agency. I also checked my free credit report on Credit Karma and Chase, and I don't see any record of this debt at all -- the amount that I am currently paying directly to the hospital, or the amount that mysteriously disappeared.

So I feel like I should call the collections agency and/or the hospital to find out if I still owe them money... but I'm worried they'll try to screw me somehow, like calling to check will be admitting that I knew I owed and wasn't paying or something. Should I just wait to see if they contact me?",finance

   Last year we built our own home and used a very small credit union for the funding of the construction loan. Going this route had its advantages but those have now run their course.

All of this was up front information, nothing backhanded or shady.

personalfinance,Do people get to fixated on interest rates when weighing extra payments vs investing?,"So I am wondering if people get too fixated on interest rates when deciding if they should invest money or pay down their mortgage faster? I have read many articles that say you should never pay your home off early because you can make much more money investing that extra principal payment in the stock market, but I ran some numbers and what I found is that there is a huge problem with fixating on this comparison of your mortgage APR interest rate, versus the return of the market. End result being neither way is right or wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

John Doe is 20 years old and wants to calculate things as if he will retire at age 65. John Doe got out a 120k 30 year loan at a 3.875% APR (fixed). All this assumes market growth rate of a Roth IRA is 5% with 2% variance over 45 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 1: John Doe makes minimum payments each month. Over the course of the $120k loan, he has $83,142 in interest, making the total cost of that loan $203,142. John takes $700 month and invests it in a Roth IRA while he's paying the mortgage. At the end of 30 years he has $558k in the IRA. After he pays the mortgage off, he adds the $564/mo in with that and is contributing $1364/month to the IRA. In the next 15 years before he retires he builds $1.51m in that IRA.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 2: John Doe makes $700/month extra payments into his mortgage and hold off on opening a Roth IRA. (Some would call this foolish!) By making $700/month extra payments, he's able to shorten his loan to 10.5 years. John Doe arguably makes $79.2k in extra payments, but with that gets a 30% rate of return on those extra payments as he saves $23.5k in interest over that loan life. John Doe then for the 34.5 years is able to invest $1364 /month into a Roth IRA. When he would have had the house paid off in scenario 1, he has built $500k in wealth. He is about $58k in wealth behind. At age 65, he has $1.39m - or is $120k behind.

&amp;#x200B;

But, here's where it gets funny. If he was smart and saving money at the same time, you realize he saved $23.5k in interest. By putting that $23.5k in opportunity savings as a starting payment for his IRA, by the time Scenario 1 would have had the mortgage paid off, and had $558k in worth built, Scenario 2 would have $559k in worth. So by paying his loan off earlier, he has about $1000 more in worth at 30 years in. At age 65, he has $1.52m in that IRA, or is about $20k richer.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the moral of this story is either way there is no wrong way? Paying the loan off early means there is less risk. Also allows the flexibility for one spouse to work part time or be a homemaker. But not making extra payments also means while you have the mortgage loan longer, you have more cash flow for emergencies. And either way you assess the opportunity cost or opportunity gain with the return on interest savings, both scenarios even without putting the opportunity savings as a starting point, while $120k seems like a lot, it's not really much of a difference between $1.39m and $1.51m",finance

So between what I have in my savings and the recent $8k I got for my car I have about $14,000 at my disposal and I would like to invest it in a meaningful way. My work does not offer a 401k plan for my position. I tried getting a HYSA at my current bank but their interest rates are terrible(0.4%).

Is $14,000 a reasonable amount of money to start investing in stocks? Or should I just save it for a down payment on a house or something in the future? I want to start building wealth as fast as possible and the younger you start the higher the returns right? My goal is to reach financial independence younger in life, so that I can spend more time doing things I want/like rather than slaving away for the next 40-50 years.

personalfinance,I'm being asked to pay for my own stay on business travel over the weekends. This can't be right?,"I work for a company based in California (CA) but I don't work in CA normally. I'm being asked to support a test in CA for the next three weeks. 

The problem is, my program manager just informed me that we'll have to cover our own expenses over the weekend because there's insufficient funds in the program budget, including hotel and food. Normally I travel to a test site with on campus housing and just stay there and drive home on the weekends. This time I won't be able to drive back and forth and there is no on site housing, so it's never come up.

It doesn't feel right to me. Either they have to pay to cover my expenses while I'm up there or to fly me back and forth...right?

Edit: this isn't coming from my company, it's from my project. I am an engineer, we have to charge (bill) our hours to specific projects. We don't really have an overhead budget, we bill to projects. My site is low on project funds due to the end of the federal fiscal year. There's plenty of work once the next year of funds are released but that depends on Congress. Until my next year's funds come in, I have to find other work. This is my other work. 

I just want to know for sure that I can tell my program manager he has to pay for my weekend expenses - Google has not been helpful so I figured I'd ask you guys in case someone knew so I have the answer before I go talk to management.

Edit 2: the fine folks over at /r/legaladvice indicated that CA does require reimbursement of reasonable expenditures related to business travel. https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-and-local-updates/pages/tips-for-reimbursing-california-employees-business-expenses.aspx",finance

personalfinance,401k Loan to pay off student loans,"I am considering taking a loan against my 401k to pay off my student loans. In my mind, the only real concern is if I leave my company or am laid off, which I don’t see happening for the length of the loan.

To me the positives are:

-Removing that student loan debt

-interest rate is a bit lower and...

-the interest is just going back into my 401k, so I’m not really losing the money.

-it’s an auto paying loan right out of my paycheck, which will be $300 a month less then my current student loan payments, and I can take that money and invest it instead. 

Are there unforeseen negatives? Is this a good move?",finance

personalfinance,When will the interest I pay start to decrease?,"Hi Reddit,  


Could someone clear up what I am missing here? I thought that as I pay down a loan the ratio of principal to interest should get more favorable with my monthly payments. For example, every month I pay $567 for student loans and 60% of that is going to interest. I also pay $300 additional dollars a month just towards my principal. I have payed nearly 10% of my loan off and that ratio has not become more favorable in the slightest. I pay a 5.25% interest rate and my current loan balance is $77,500.   


When will my monthly payments start impacting my balance more? It feels like I'm pushing as hard as I can to move my balance to zero and It's barely having an impact.

personalfinance,Minimize Expenses by going solar before the end of the year,"Disclaimer: I live in Colorado, where the Sun shines 300+ days per year, but I suspect this would work for a large part of the US as well (Arizona, NM, TX, FL etc)

We all know that the two secrets to increase wealth: maximize revenue and minimize expenses. I want to focus on the second part here in this post.Solar panels are getting really cheap these days (even with a 30% tariff added in Jan 2017) , and so are many used Electric Vehicle (EV) . Solar panels are costing less than $1 per watt (different efficiency varies) and with professional installations (labors, net meters etc) costing about $2 per watt. A typical 6000 watt system which on average produces about 7800 kWh a year in Colorado (650 kWh/month) would cost about $18000 installed. If you do this before the end of the year, you get a check for 30% of the total system cost from the federal government, for a total cost of about $12000. After the new year, that check would be just 26% (In 2022 this number will be 0%), and we all know which Orange American is behind this drop, but that's a political rant for another day.

A lot of cities in the US offers solar loans at about 5% APR. A quick calculation would tell you that with $0 down, the monthly payment for the system per month would be $79 for 20 years, $95 for 15 years, or $127 for 10 years.  After the system pays off, your cost would be $0 a month. You could also take out a personal loan from most banks for solar projects. They could offer even lower APR. Or if you happen to have the money on hand, you could just pay it off cash.

So let's take a look at how much people could save. In Colorado, 1 kWh cost about $.11\~$.14, so let's use average $.12 for the calculation. $.12\*650 = $78. But wait! That's not all. There are also taxes and transmission cost associated with the usage, which means that you save more than that much. If you look at your power bill you can see that taxes and fees are at least 30% of your electric bills, sometimes it could be as high as 70%! So with solar power you are looking at a 0 or negative power usage for most of the year, saving you 100% of the electricity cost. In places like California, where 1 kWh costs getting to as high as $.24, your monthly cost could be $156 plus tax and fees, which means that you will be saving at least $29 a month even if you chose the 10 year payment plan. Each year, utilities companies raise the rates/fees. With your own solar system, you will have peace of mind from rising energy cost.

But wait! There is more potential savings. Most houses in the US has tanked gas water heater, which requires replacement every 8\~12 years. A tanked (50 gallon) electric water heater cost about $380 at Home Depot. So if you happen to need to replace your gas water heater soon, you can get a tanked electric water heater, and save even more: I used to pay $50 a month for gas for a family of 4. After replacing it with electric water heater, my gas bills in the summer is literally $1 ( gas pilot light for the furnace?)

But wait! There is more potential savings. Used Electric cars are so cheap these days it is definitely worth looking into. I bought a used 2015 S Nissan LEAF with 24 kWh battery in 2016 for $9000 cash. It was a great deal. But you can surely find many sub-10k electric cars on the internet these days. And if you calculate the savings in addition to your electric costs, it is mind blowing: People casually drop $2000 \~ $4000 a year on gas alone without a second thought. That's gonna be $0 for you with the solar panels. 10 years of this you will save at least $20000, which is no small change. And then there's the maintenance savings: There is no oil change every 3000 miles; no spark-plug change, no tune-ups, no transmission fluid flush, no $500 \~ $700 average maintenance each year associated with the dirty gasoline engine. There are various subs for EV's on reddit you can refer to. /r/leaf, /r/volt, /r/bolt, etc. Notice how I excluded Tesla because it is so expensive it does not really make good financial sense, even for used ones.",finance
personalfinance,(Housing) What to do about home refinance options,"Some quick info before I start. I have lived in my home for 10 years (current loan 254,000 4.75% apr, estimated value 380,000). I plan to stay here for a long time. I had a VA loan. About 2 years ago I got divorced and paid out my ex with equity from the house, because it was a cash out refinance I switched to a conventional loan to avoid the 3.3% fee. 

Now that the rates have dropped my family friend (he does home loans) contacted me about doing a refinance. He had brought up doing a IRRRL refinance (interest rate reduction refinance loan for VA loans only) and we started talking options, I also did a little research and got some quotes from the best offers online. 

At the end of the day I went with BNC (online, specialize in VA loans). They had the best rates and APR. **Here's where the problem cam in... While getting my paperwork done for the IRRRL they emailed me and informed me that I have a conventional loan (I forgot).** 

So these are my options now:

1. VA refinance. 3.3% funding fee. 3.625% rate (3.763% APR). $4500 lender credit. ($270 cash from me at closing)
2. VA refinance. 3.3% funding fee. 3.125% rate (3.381% APR). $625 lender credit. ($2142 cash from me at closing)
3. Conventional refinance. 0 funding fee. 4% rate (4.045% APR). $300 lender credit. ($3567 cash from me at closing)
4. Wait and refinance later with better credit and possibly lower interest rates

So here is where I need advice. They have already done a hard pull on my credit (704 middle score). The VA loan cutoff for the prime rate is 680, however conventional is 740. I can walk away and wait till my credit is back up. Numbers wise the VA loan will take 6+ years to catch up on the funding fee... But I think my best option is getting back on a VA loan (because I do believer the rates will drop again and a IRRRL reficnance could get be below 3% and only cost me a small fee) which is going to hit me with a 3.3% no matter when I do it. With talks of housing interest rates dropping even more should I go with the  3.125% and come out of pocket, or go with the 3.625% to save money and possibly refinance again later when the rates drop (only a .5% fee and no appraisal ect)

TL;DR of the article:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Naturally, hearing “growth of the balance sheet” sounds to some like a return to quantitative easing.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Strategists at Wall Street’s biggest banks sought to head off that sort of framing almost immediately.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;This is not some Wall Street ploy to play down the significance of the Fed resuming balance-sheet growth.   
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;They say the central bank will need to purchase about $150 billion of assets a year.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed chair’s communication record, after all, has been spotty at best. Still, even he wouldn’t dare call any open-market operations a return to QE.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Should they go with permanent open-market operations, it “will inevitably be referred to by some in the media as ‘QE,’” JPMorgan’s Feroli ***lamented***. “This would be unfortunate.”  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;“Don’t Call It QE.”

I hate being talked down to - so if I properly understood what QE was, this article alone would have made me want to call this new thing QE too...

Shame I don't really understand what QE is - or this new thing. Or what repo markets are.",finance

personalfinance,"I'm buying a home for $178,000. I have some mortgage questions.","So I'm pretty handy in Excel and I created some data models for payment per months, total interest, total principal, and total paid. Here is my financial situation thus far.

- I owe a little bit on my credit cards, not much and interest rate is low around $2,000.00 currently.

- I have around $105,000 in a savings account, $57,000 in Roth IRA, and $4,000 in a 401k I just started.

- Take home pay is roughly $4,200 per month and I'm single so no spouse I can rely on to supplement my income.

- If I put 30% down that is roughly $53,400 which basically cuts my savings in half.

- After down-payment - 15 year loan at estimated 3.25% PMT would be $875.53, while a 30 year loan at the same rate is $542.27.

- 15 year loan interest paid is $32,994.55 while 30 year loan is $70,616.15. Resulting in paying a extra $37,621.59 over the life of the loan if I only pay that minimum. 

That said I would still have a healthy amount of savings left but my questions...

- Would it be wiser to start initially as a 30 year loan, 0 down (VA home loan) if I don't even know I'll be in the home longer than 5 years? Its possible I'm there longer. Then later on refinance for 15 year?

- The larger down-payment and 15-year loan just seems like a smarter way to do this. Is that correct?",finance

personalfinance,"Paying down debt, not sure what order to pay","Hi All, using a throwaway here and looking for some advice, TIA. Two years ago, we realized we were in a lot of financial trouble- a bunch of poor decisions and bad events came together. We were $45k in consumer debt and going into the negative every month. Long story short, spent a year stopping the bleeding and then I negotiated a promotion and 30% pay increase. Last year, we got most everything switched off high interest debt, and paid down about $15k. Plan is to get it all paid off in two more years. Budget is under control and I am comfortable with where we are with that, and don't really have the ability to increase income further right now.  I should also add that all of this is being done with my salary, and I am in education, so I am on a 9-month contract- by years I mean September-May. I have a side gig for summer, but don't have the ability to work more during that time because I don't have childcare and am also responsible for an aging parent during those months (siblings and I take turns). 

So, the question is, we have the ability to pay off about $15k this year. We have $7500 on card A at 0% until April 2020 (minimum payment $75), $7800 on card B at 0% until February 2021 (minimum payment $78), and $14k in a personal loan at 10.49% with two years left on the loan and a payment of $620 per month. My plan is to pay off card A this year and card B next year, and just pay the loan on schedule. But, I am wondering if since it is the one with interest, I should be aggressively paying the loan, and just paying minimums on the 0% cards. My fear is that I think we will be a bit shy of actually paying off the loan this year (because of the minimums going to the credit cards) and that I will not be able to get 0% balance transfers again if there is some kind of economic change, and then those interest rates shoot up to 18% and 22%.

So, should I continue with my current plan, pay down the loan and hope for balance transfers when the time comes, or try to refinance the loan?  Experian FICO 9 is 768 and my salary is $70k, household salary is about $150k, HCOL area.",finance

personalfinance,Wondering what the best course of action would be to avoid debt,"Hi folks,

so as the title says i'm trying to avoid debt at this point, but I really want to invest more.  I teeter back and forth each month, depending on expenses, so i'll give you a rundown of my budget first:

Variable expenses:
roughly 1k total broken down into:
food: 500
recreational activities with friends: 100
gas: 130
smokes: 113
dogs: 123

Fixed Expenses:
roughly 2.3k total
Mortgage:  800
HOA:  240
Car payment: 260
Motorcycle: 200
Disability Insurance/Life insurance: 123
federal student loans: 330
private student loans: 200
emergency fund: 175

My income is 52k, but i put away 260 into a 401(k) that's matched each month, add in my taxes and health insurance and I walk away with 2,983 a month.

so i'm obviously over budget this month, which is what's sparking this.  all of those variable expenses go on my CC, as does my electric bill, water bill, gas bill and internet.. which are my only bills.

My current plan is to quit smoking and try to cut my food expenses to under $100 per month, which should bring me pretty close to break even, if not afford a little extra in savings.

what I'm wondering is:  should I consolidate my student loans?  my highest interest rates rest around 6.5%, which is for my unsubsidized federals, and my private... but my subsidized sit closer to 3%

my car, bike, and house APR are all under 4% so i'm not worried about paying those off as fast.

I might have an opportunity to move for work, with a small raise, within the same company.  if this happened I would rent out my house and not buy in the new location.  if this doesn't happen, I was considering rent out my second bedroom, but i'm unsure how that would go as I have two dogs.

is there anything else I should be doing going into october?",finance
personalfinance,"Need advice on best loan to take for debt consolidation (US, Texas)","I am in a personal situation that needs some debt consolidation. I had 1 year without job due to layoffs but it also happened to be my wedding year so finances went a little out of control along with other debt on a car loan and student loan. Currently I have the following debt: 
*$35k in credit card debt (high high interest) 
*$10k in student loans (low interest), only making minimum payments, I think 10yrs left. 
*$5k on car payment (4% APR), less than 1 year left. 
*$12k on a personal loan from Prosper.com under family member name (11.4% APR). This is a 5yr loan and 4.5yrs left. 
*$17k from a personal loan given by family member as cash with zero interest on payback. Paying back at 4yr payback rate. 

I have finally rebounded after some years of trying to deal with the whole life situation and now have a stable job with $95k/yr salary with bonuses maybe $100-$110k/yr. To keep expenses down I live with my parents. 

I am making more than minimum payments on all the loans as much as I can while also trying to save a little for future. My question is how to consolidate the high interest credit card loans to something more manageable? The other loans in my opinion are manageable and I will be working away to clear all those debt and plan on living with parents for next 5+ years because realistically that's what it will take. 

Some of the options I tried 
*Personal loan for credit card consolidation is my last option since its will be a very high interest and not sure if I will even get approved. A family member with good income is willing to co-sign to help bring interest rate downs if needed. 

*My dad has $100k of equity in his house and he does not qualify with his income to take additional loans. However we tried to get a loan with him and me co-signing with my income but that was also denied. That loan was for 5% interest with 15yr pay back. This would have been ideal for me to help build some savings while having a solid plan to pay off everything eventually. It was denied because according to the bank I need to be on the title of the house for my dad to cosign with me for a equity loan, but apparently they did not disclose this at the very beginning when they did all the paper work and home appraisal. 

Ideally I would like to use my dads equity because that would be the lowest interest and longest pay back period for me to help manage my savings a little bit. What would be another way to utilize this option? My brother mentioned having the title of the house transferred to my name and then taking the home equity loan. 

I know its really frowned up here regarding co-signing and all but I am on a track to be back to stable and normal. My family is close and they are trusting me with a lot and i do not plan to disappoint them.",finance

Repo injections, QE, or whatever this is called; it proves once again how the Federal Reserve's policies continue to increase income inequality. When your bank account is in the negative and you're trying to pay rent or medical bills, the Federal Reserve won't deposit any cash in your account. Heck, for common Americans, it can take weeks to get money through the financial system. But if you're a bank, a big fund, a big stockholder, and part of the Wall Street Cartel, you'll get Federal Reserve subsidies overnight!

personalfinance,How to make the best out/budget correctly of upcoming salary,"Hi PF,

I'm currently a college student graduating in May and looking to start off on the right track. I want to budget correctly and make sure I'm putting stuff where I should.

My base salary starting next summer is $83,567, with a bonus of up to 5% based on personal and company performance. 



My employer gave me a benefits brochure, but the wording is super confusing especially surrounding the savings plans (IRA, 401k) it says the following:

The company provides a matching contribution to the SSP equal to 50% of your base contributions, up to 8% of your pay, to a maximum matching contribution of 4% of base pay on a weekly basis

 You may be eligible to receive an additional weekly Company Contribution to the SSP of up to 6% based on your pay regardless of whether you contribute a portion of your weekly base pay through the 401(k) feature of the SSP. You will receive a special communication if you are eligible to receive this contribution

From that I gather that the company will match 50% of whatever I contribute up to 8%, so they do 4% I do 8%. That doesn't seem all that great

All of the health insurance plans and whatnot are pretty mediocre from what I can tell, but they'll pay for grad school so it all pans out.



I also am not sure how to budget properly or where money should be going to.

If I contribute 8% to the 401k my take home is $56,762 with PA and Federal Tax (Assuming I did the math correctly) or 4730.16/mo or 1091.57/wk (I get paid weekly)

I tried to lay out some of the costs I may encounter, but I'm not sure how accurate they are

* Rent: $880/mo, (1,600) split with girlfriend, Rent in my area for what we're looking for is between $1,300 and $1,800.
* Food: $300/mo, ($600 split). 
* Gas: $150/mo
* Phone: $70/mo ($140 split)
* Utilities: $150/mo? I have no idea how much utilities cost, or what I can expect for this. We don't plan on living in a big space, however I do have a few computers that run 24/7
* Internet: $60/mo, because of those computers, fast internet is important to me, cable is for chumps.
* Reoccurring charges: $50/mo, things like Spotify,Netflix,etc. I'm not sure of the exact number, but $50 is probably about right. 
* Car Insurance: My car insurance is currently $120/mo, though should be falling in the next few months


I probably forgot something else important 

That ends up being 1,730/mo which leaves me with $3,000/mo



I do not have any student loans, I own my car outright and it's in good condition. 

My grandparents own a house on the Chesapeake bay. My dad and grandpa build the house with their hands and has been in our family for the past 40 odd years. However, it seems my grandparents retirement saving are starting to run low.  According to my grandpa it costs $14k/yr to keep due to property taxes and utilities. I'm not sure how much my grandparents, aunt, dad are contributing and I'm not sure how great of an idea having a stake in a house at 22 will be. I said offhandedly I would be able to contribute 1-2k, but I'm not sure how much I can follow up with that. 



**So I guess I have 4 big questions**

* Am I forgetting some big cost in my breakdown?
* what the fuck do I do with $3000/mo?
* Should I be contributing to a IRA? some kind of savings? more to 401k?
* Can/what can I afford to contribute to keeping my families house


Thank you!",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my second mortgage?,"Roughly 2 years ago we took out a 15k loan to pay for a new roof. This was a 3 year loan with an interest rate 3.49%, so I have roughly 1 year left on it (little more).

I have Just under 6k remaining; I also have a high yield savings (1.8%) account with 21.5k in it. (I put in roughly 1k/month) I am already on my way to maxing my 401k and IRA contributions with monthly deposits. I have money in another account to handle mortgage payments for the next 3-4 months.

I'd like to pay off the loan, but at this point it looks like my interest paid on the amortization table is around $17.5/month, while my interest earned from the high-yield is \~$23/month. Does it make sense to just pay off the loan, and use the monthly payments + existing monthly deposit to bring it back up? should take roughly 4 months.

VEVFX: 4k

VGENX: 4k

VGPMX: 3k

VTSAX: 5k

I am fortunate enough to be able to graduate from college debt-free through scholarship and do not have any loans or personal debts.

Year 1: 47k

Year 2: 58k

Year 3: 70k

Year 4: 84k

Everything beyond here has to be competed for but it is possible that in year 5 I could break six figures. 1.5x OT is possible but not guaranteed in my position (since all federal workers are technically hourly). I plan to put 20% of my salary aside into my TSP (max contribution is $19,000).

**Expenses: 1470/mo**

Rent + Utilities: 1050- this will drop once my current lease ends (college housing is a monopoly) and I expect to be in the 500-600 range for a place with roommates (to get closer to 30% take-home)

Gas: 40

Phone: 80

Food: 200

Girlfriend: 50

Gifts/Fun: 50

I do not have a car payment, nor do I have to pay car insurance at this time. Furthermore, I am fortunate enough to still be on my family's healthcare plan.

The total funds in previous employer’s 401K = $39K, of which $19.5K are my Roth contributions and $19.5K are pre-tax Employer Safe Harbor Match. 
 
My 401K with my new employer is not a Roth, but I think I could switch to Roth if I wanted to. My new employer will not match my 401K contributions until January 2021. At that point they will match up to 6%. Right now I’m contributing 6% of my salary to this new 401K anyways. 

I also have $51K in undergrad/graduate student loans (with interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 6.0%).

I’m conflicted as to whether I should:

1) Roll over the entire $39K from the Roth 401K to my 401K with my current employer (and switch it to a Roth) and just call it a day. 

OR

2) Roll over the pre-tax $19.5K from Employer Safe Harbor Match directly to my new 401K provider. Then take the cash payout for the $19.K of my own contributions (which I was told would not face the 20% withholding tax because it’s coming from a Roth) and put that towards my student loans (starting with the 6% interest rate loan). 

And in case relevant: I have about $15K in savings. Take-home salary is about $5.8K/month. Right now I pay between $500-1000 a month towards my student loans – my minimum payment is just $275/month. Student loans are my only debt.

I have a friend who also has pretty stellar credit but spent almost $25,000 cash on a vehicle, leaving him with almost no residual savings but feeling like he'd won because he wouldn't be making payments for the next few years. With his credit he could have gone to a CU and walked away with his car, a manageable payment, and most of that cash still available to use in far more beneficial endeavors or in case of emergency. I can't imagine it feeling too good to walk out to your new car but not have cash for an unexpected major expense.

Is there an easy means to see where the line is between cash sums for purchases that make sense versus financing for little to no interest with the ability to put that large sum into some kind of interest-earning account or investment platform? Is there any reason not to do that $2k UHD TV at 0% even if you have the cash? When does it make sense to pay out of pocket for a large purchase? At 4% repayment? At 7%? I'm just trying to figure out if there's a relatively straightforward way to take the total cost, the time value of money, and relative interest rates into account and make smart decisions when it comes to what should be financed and what should be a direct purchase assuming that both are viable options based on income.",finance

personalfinance,Confused about when my credit card is reporting my information???,"Hi, this is my first credit card that I'm using to build my credit since I don't really have any loans. It's a Navy Federal card with only a $200 limit.

The card and app itself always list the payments as ""due"" by the 15th of every month, but when I look at credit karma it'll tell me it was reported on the 19th and that the balance being used in calculations is whatever i have on the 19th. 

What is happening? If I can't go by when the card issuer is telling me to pay off the card what the hell can I go by? Its so frustrating to use my card, pay it off when I'm told, but have my credit score reflect a random balance because I just used it a few days later.

It's to the point where I feel like I can only use my credit card for like a specific window of 15 days (where I know my balance for that month has already been calculated and it's not about to be the next one)",finance

personalfinance,"Ditched MIP After I was told it was impossible by an ""expert""","Today is a good day. 5 years ago I closed an an FHA loan for a $329,000 house in Alaska. I only had 3.5% to put down and got a 3.5% APR. 

I didnt read the small print and thought MIP of $333/month would cancel once I reached 80% LTV. Boy was I wrong, a year before I got my loan FHA changed it to lifetime MIP which is outrageous.

Fast forward to a few months ago, I noticed comparable sales of my house going for nearly 400k. I called my original realtor and she scoffed at me, said there was no way my house was worth enough to be at 80% LTV if I refinanced. That I had another 10 years of MIP and just needed to deal with it, even after I explained my research.

I decided to go it on my own and shop refinances. After a few offers I settled on a 3.3% 15 year loan. The appraisal came back at $390,000, which put me in for NO MIP!

My 30 year loan payment was $2275, my new payment on a 15 year is $2515. So I knocked off 10 years and saved over $220,000 on the life of the loan for a mere $240 extra per month.

 I have two choices now as I am refinancing - a 10/1 ARM at 3.25, no closing costs and a 30 year fixed at 3.625 no closing costs.

I could make a little more additional payment towards principle and reduce the 30 year term to 25 years so I am guaranteed a fixed term for at least next 30 years

However, the 10/1 seems lucrative, saving me almost $3216 a year at this interest rate.

The 30 year would give some peace of mind, with a potential to refinance down the lane if the interest rates would go down. 10/1 would have the down side of interest rates going up before you could refinance again.

personalfinance,At what point does convenience trump savings?,"I am purchasing a vehicle and am getting a loan pre-approved through a couple of credit unions.

In the past I took an auto loan from Navy Federal Credit Union in which they sent me a check with a maximum amount, I took it to the dealership, signed the contract, gave them the check and went on my merry way. NFCU sent me a promissory note by mail and I signed and returned by mail.

Now I have been approved for this loan from them at a 4.3% APR. Which is OK but no the best. With my credit history and score, which is perfect, I expected a better rate. Some other credit unions pre approved about a 3.9% APR, and one credit union a 3.3% APR. 

However this credit union is local and does things more traditionally. I have to go to the dealer, get a purchase order, get a ""binder"" from my insurance, take it or fax it to the CU, go to the CU to open an account, wait for it to be processed, receive a check for the total amount, take it to the dealership and hand them the check. Then I need to make payments either by depositing to the CU or mailing a physical check.

This is of course a pain in the ass. I want to do the NFCU loan because its so convenient, I do all my banking there, they're great ot work with remotely, but of course its always good to save money. This is for a $21,000 loan over  5 years so the difference is in the hundreds.

Edit: Is it at all common to ask a loan service to reconsider an APR by sending them an approval letter from another lender with another apr? Or would they probably just tell me to take that loan?",finance

Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan - 4,003 - 6.8%

How about any advice on refinancing? Or withdrawing from their 401k to pay off loan (mine is more sizeable - and we are in late 20s/early 30s, so have time to refill 401k if used to pay - just want to not pay so much interest)?

Turns out they help with federal student loan servicing. As skeptical as I was, I did some more digging into my wife’s fed loan account and see this has been going on for years - $950 up front, $249 every year after to “service” these loans. 

After spending a considerable amount of time on the phone with someone from Fiducius, it was very apparent that they do nothing I can’t do myself. They simply consolidate paperwork and payments and submit them on your behalf. The lady I talked to was trying so hard to assure me that they “provide peace of mind that it’s being done right.” 

Sadly, companies like Fiducius are preying on people with Federal Loans who feel pressured to have it done the right way. StudentLoans.gov makes it very simple for anyone to complete all this on there own without a third party’s help. And your loan servicer will most likely be more than willing to assist you with any questions you have. 

So for anyone considering using a third party, don’t waste your time or money. THESE COMPANIES ARE SCAMS. Fiducius and similar companies are complete jokes.",finance

investing,Stock Compound Interest Question?,"So compound interest in a bank account makes sense to me. However I am having trouble grasping this concept when it is applied to stocks. Using this compound interest calculator:  [http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound\_interest\_calculator.htm](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm)

With $100 principal. $0 Annual Addition. 1 year to grow. An annual interest rate of 700%(A helluva stock pick). Compounded 365 times annually. I get to $102,630.76. AWESOME! However I don't understand this at all.

My current understanding: I buy 100 shares of company XYZ at $1 a share. So that accounts for the $100 in principal. Those shares go up 700% making each share worth $8 a share. Since I own 100 shares I now have 100 shares x $8/share = $800.

I know the discrepancy is in the number of times it is compounded annually. If I put in the calculator to compound it 365 times annually it radically changes the answer from if I put 1. However I do not understand why it would not compound more than once total for a stock. If you own a $100 wrist watch and it doubles in value and you sell it for $200 that doubling wouldn't compound so why would a $100 stock compound if it doubled?

[SPOILERS]
I've been playing through the new game, I'm at level 22 on Fl4k and I've had I think 7 bosses.

The first was the DJ, mouthpiece.  The map blasting me from the sides was a cool concept. Only problems was the boss was a shield carrier, and while the cue for the wall blasts was obvious, it was too hard to spot which wall was going off mid Chaos. Still a fun fight 7/10

Second was the Gigamind. He had drones as his primary weapons and buffed his allies with a quickly regenerating shield, not a problem Qqq your last stand and really need that revive.  Spent a lot of time trying to break his shields so that I could actually hurt him. My pet ended up doing more damage than me shearly out of Aggro being pinned on the player.  6/10

Next was Truant. He sucked. He's resistant to fire and ice damage, and nigh immune to Radiation. That combined with the Indiana Jones boulders cycling through the only cover on the map, forcing you out into open space to fight him lest you die to the 9999999 fire damage every 5 seconds. I had to use a Lightning/corrosive SMG for the majority of the fight bc standard damage wouldn't cut it. All of the Miliwan NPC's hide in one area preventing you from Second winding off of them unless you put yourself in the fireballs path. The fight felt long. 3/10

After Traunt was the Katagawa ball. I liked this fight. Felt like a servitor from D2 but played better than just rolling itself 10 ft to the left every time you crit. Only problem was it had a stupid number of projectiles and AOEs that would eat into your hp even behind cover. Solid 9/10

After that was Katagawa himself. He plays some basic tricks throughout the fight like clones. It wasn't hard to see through as all you had to do was not look away immediately. He wasn't very complex in any motions or tactics. He throws some weird effects out there that I didn't quite grasp but otherwise solid for a humanoid fight. 6/10

After Katagawa was the first vault, The Rampager. Simple 3 stage fight. He changes element as the fight goes on, only complaints were that you couldn't really dodge some of his attacks unless you were at a high difference or standing super far away, and the fight was rather basic. 5/10

The 7th boss is what really salted me to write this post, The Warden. The Warden starts off semi interesting. You begin at level 20/21. He's wielding to dual LMGs that do crap loads of damage. You have to protect yourself behind cover and fight off adds for a few seconds until he stops to ""reload""  at which point you tear ass before he starts shooting again. Cool. After you reduce him the first time he turns into a rager, his head pops off and he changes into melee combat. Only problem is he kicks my poor spiderants ass meaning either I spend the time reviving only for him to get punked again in 10 seconds or let him die and loose that 2dps. 

Here's where the fight starts to suck. After reducing his health to 25% he goes into his next phase. He full heals and goes up one level. He renames to super raged warden or some shit and fight continues. He does this 3 more times after that. From Regular&gt;Super&gt;Mega&gt;Ultimate&gt;God&gt;Dead. It was an easy fight. I didn't die once, but I did spend 20 minutes kiting a boss backwards until he finally died at level 25. 4 levels above me. This wasn't fun. 1/10

The problems in these fight were probably mad worse by the fact that I didn't have ammo half the time(I dont remember that being so bad in PreSeq) and the fact the spiderants tree is more of a sustain and crit focused tree",technology

Thanks everyone!

Hello,

I'd like some pointers about my situation. Thanks in advance :)

I was hired as an independent contractor for a project. The contracting company withholds no taxes and intends to send me a 1099. Since I was not expecting to file as a sole proprietorship until Q3, I have made no quarterly payments in the past ^(yes I know I'm late :/). Everything indicates that I should be paying quarterly as a sole proprietorship.

Because I didn't pay in Q1 and Q2, *common sense tells me to pay 1/2 of the taxes I expect to owe on the contractor money as soon as possible, and the remaining 1/2 after Q4*, or maybe even 3/4 now and 1/4 later. What do sole proprietorships generally do in this situation? Am I even right to classify this as a sole proprietorship?

The biggest worry about that plan is that the IRS may charge for underpayments on Q1 and Q2, but again the ""business"" didn't exist back then.

If it matters, I'm a nonresident alien with a visa, working with authorization. So, I'm looking at Form 1040-ES (NR). Under my status, I am not liable for self-employment tax. I expect to owe $3000 in federal income tax, with most of that being from the contractor project and has not been withheld.

Thanks so much!

&amp;#x200B;

**MAINFINEX** offers a trusted exchange that crypto traders can use to make informed trades and participate in the cryptocurrency market. At the time of launch, MAINFINEX offers 15 different cryptocurrency pairs, all of which include USDT. The MAINFINEX cryptocurrency exchange offers something for every type of trader, regardless of experience level. Beginners will appreciate the intuitive interface and the fact that MAINFINEX uses Tradingview charts, which have numerous online tutorials for guidance. Advanced traders will appreciate the hundreds of drawing tools, the vast quantity of indicators, and high level of customization for charts. 

**Challenges faced by cryptocurrency exchanges today:**

● Failure to apply global financial practices, and poor interface

● Large number of exchanges with little differentiation which complicates the choice of platform for operations

● Large number of unsuccessful traders losing money

● Pain points that are still there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Exchange**

Our understanding of the needs of the key trading parties in digital exchanges comes down to the concept “Traders seek liquidity and investors need profitability.”

1. Liquidity and profitability

A mechanism we could build in to solve the problems of traders and long-term investors based on the exchange policy related to

trading fees:

* Flexible interest rate depending on the volume, thus reducing the trading fee. The more activity in a trading section, the cheaper it is for that section
* Fees reduced in case of severe price deviation. To reduce volatility and slippage and thus increase liquidity, market-making traders creating liquidity will be charged at a lower rate. The increase in volumes triggered by the reduced fee in case of price deviation will help smoothen out volatility.

2. Reliability

Traders bearing losses have a regressive fee scale depending on the volume of the loss. This mechanism serves to mitigate the consequences of unfavorable deals for a trader.

3. Sustainability “Back to the battle” Traders who have lost money but made it to the daily TOP 100 based on the volume will receive tokens compensating all the fees they paid or part of the losses. This will help stimulate liquidity in the exchange and create best cryptocurrency market conditions for arbitrage funds. Such funds account for up 80% of transaction in fiat exchanges.

4. Concept: gaming elements of the exchange, buttons, etc. “Titles and statuses” With the emergence of cryptocurrencies, the world of finance has been transformed. It has to be clear and relevant for our users since the key audience of the exchange is 25-38 years old. Which means they played DOOM 2 when they were school students (in 1994). Why can’t we give simple names to complex financial instruments? It was the stunts and dirty tricks that guys in suits from investment banks played that eventually caused the mortgage crisis. We have selected the most popular financial instruments that we can provide. They can be understood and activated in one click. We have chosen simple names for them:

● ""Forecast”

This button activates an analytical indicator used by most profitable traders

● ""Call for help”

Activates a trading robot that will close transactions for you based on algorithms. Trading robots will be provided by successful third party funds

● ""Stop me”

Block trading activity for two days. This is a mechanism that successful traders recommend to newbies. Breaks in trading activity help increase the accuracy of decisions and overall profitability

● ""Join the group”

This function lets the user transfer money to a pool of professional traders. Similar to PAMM accounts in forex companies

● “Saving up for retirement”

10% from each profitable transaction will be automatically transferred to the annual/call deposit. Many experienced traders who work for themselves do not care about savings because trading is a constant source of big income. Having such a long-term deposit is one of the key ways to ensure security and can even save a family in the bad times

● “Work for us”

Traders without substantial deposits but with free working hours can make money by performing important tasks for the exchange, like in Amazon Mechanical Turk

● “Vanity fair”

Most successful traders may share their divine trading strategies in a master class for traders, with payment in our tokens.

5. To benefit from certain options like the trading robot or funds management, users will be required to perform specific actions, e.g.: Purchasing exchange tokens. Equivalent free options: e.g., reposting our news daily throughout a month, which will also help expand the user’s subscriber base.

6. Purchasing liquidity from “mini exchanges”

A partner exchange that will provide liquidity for trading in our exchange or display our depth of market diagram on its website will receive all the relevant fees collected in our tokens. This is how this mechanism works. Mini exchanges have a permanent audience of traders creating liquidity but due to the small volumes, the mutual liquidity among the participants is low and transactions are infrequent. This is a case of “the chicken or the egg” problem. The more users there are, the more frequently the transactions occur between the same users. Accordingly, a mini exchange will be able to increase the volume of fees collected by 3-4 times by using this opportunity.

7. IEO sale

A shopping cart with all kinds of tokens. Includes both potentially successful and unsuccessful coins that cannot afford to pay the listing fee on their own. We collect the entire pool in a cart and sell it as one portfolio at a greatly reduced price. This gives unsuccessful ICO projects an opportunity to return part of the invested funds. And the users buying such assets at a rate below the cost level have more chances of profiting from price growth. The higher risk of unsuccessful projects in the portfolio compensated by the low price and the potentially high profitability is the key incentive.

8. Exchange Tutorial

Just like in complex computer games such as urban construction simulators or turn-based strategies, at the first stage the player is taught how to use the game’s functionalities before he starts playing it in the full mode. Finance and cryptocurrencies have never been simple. Every individual financial instrument is based on a complex concept. The simplicity of starting to trade cryptocurrencies and the lack of regulation in the market result in a situation when most traders lose their money and investments. The tutorial works the same simple way, providing prompts on the sequence of the steps in the exchange. We will cooperate with several financial regulators to improve this instrument in order to develop new instruments that will help mitigate the risk of losses for each individual trader. At the end, many of the regulators’ tasks come down to managing the consequences of the great financial gap between trading parties.

personalfinance,"I'm starting a new job soon, and I have the option of weekly, fortnightly or monthly pay.","My mortgage is set up for ~~fortnightly~~ two-weekly as my current position is paid ~~fortnightly~~ two-weekly.  I can change payment frequency without penalty.  I was planning to stay ~~fortnightly~~ two-weekly, but is there any benefit to me in choosing weekly or monthly pay over ~~fortnightly~~ two-weekly, and adjusting my mortgage to suit?  And why?

Edit : currently living pretty much paycheck-to-paycheck; minimal savings.

Edit additional : I'm wondering if there is any financial benefit to me in selecting weekly or monthly over two-weekly.  I can only presume that weekly might allow my savings to marginally increase due to the slightly longer holding time and interest accrual, though interest rates are so low as to make this trivial.  I had one employer in the past who offered 0.75% extra if I select monthly.  I think it make it easier on their accounting systems.  As employees were considered a 'creditor' in their eyes.  Trying to make everyone (except management,) a 'contractor' to the business.  Got out of there real fast.  Saw where it was heading.  Banks like paying salaries monthly.

personalfinance,Paying taxes every month just to get it all back. Is there another way?,"Hello folks,

A friend an I were talking about how we get deductions from our pay every month for federal and state taxes (Colorado) and as we have no ""assets"" or property to pay taxes on, we get most if not all of our taxes back in April, we are curious. Is there a way to have zero deductions through the year so that money could instead be saved in a better way? (Retirement or certificate or...etc.)

I've always just assumed that you had to pay from each paycheck, there wasn't a way to collect all of your paycheck and pay taxes at the end of the year. Am I mistaken?

investing,I have some technical questions about the Repo Market and FRA-OIS spread..,"I have used Google to research and learn about the Repo market mechanics. 

I understand Primary Dealers are legally mandated to bid for US T-Bills and can make money by trading them with interested parties like Insto's, Funds, Hedge Funds, other CBs via the repo rate - generally attempting to profit between the bid and repo rate. 

I would be grateful if you can share your views  on some of the things below. to me this is very interesting stuff.  I don't buy the fact that Powell said this is technical stuff and we shouldn't worry. If I was the FED I would do the same - there's not way they would admit this is serious.. 


1) why are the dealers building up an inventory? They can easily make money by bidding for the T-Bills and selling them at the Repo Rates. the level of demand is huge from outside investors. They are mandated to bid for them, but I don't think they are mandated to hold them - they can do whatever they like? So does it not make sense for them to make money? So why hold them and build up their inventory? Are they being told by their own institutions to hold them 

2) The FRA-OIS spread has significantly widenend in recent weeks. There seems to be some stress in the markets. The spread could be explained by following factors:
 A) excess supply of Short Term US treasuries, b) repartation of US dollars, c) higher risk premium for monetary policy, d) CDS for banks increasing e) fed  balance sheet declining/QT.. 


I know d) and e) can be eliminated I just checked out some data and can confirm CDS has really taken off and e) fed has injected liquidty in recent weeks. f) people expecting some stress in the financial conditions??

Maybe it's b) trump aggressive stance on China may mean he declares a national emergency and forces US companies to stop doing business with China (bit far fetched) 

Could it likely be f) we expecting some serious shit to go down in coming months? 

Appreciate that this is technical and don't expect many to respond.",finance

personalfinance,Previous employer over-payed me after I left. They wants gross amount instead of net. Must I take a financial hit to return gross amount instead of net amount (willing to return net)?,"My previous employer from California accidentally cashed out my accrued vacation hours twice. The gross amount is $800 and the net amount I received after tax deduction is $600. $50 went to health insurance and $150 went to federal and state tax. They want me to return the gross amount of $800. I asked if I could return the net amount instead and they try to recoup the tax portion from the IRS.  They want the full untaxed amount because for tax purposes, they are not able to change the amount owed as it would not be accurate on the tax statement for what was given to me.  This does not sit well with me because I don't understand why I should take a financial hit for THEIR mistake. I'm pretty sure I won't be able to recuperate the $200 that would come out of my own pocket and will have to go through a lot of hurdles just to get some of it back. I hear that employers could just recover the taxed amount from IRS since it is still within the same year. My question is am I legally obligated to return the untaxed amount? If I return the net amount of what I originally received, do they still have the right to recover the taxed portion from me? What are my options?",finance
personalfinance,How to compare mortgage loan estimates?,"I had an offer get accepted on a house(164500) and I'm currently in the process of trying to decide on a lender and I'm not really sure I understand what I'm seeing. Looking at 20 year conventional mortgages in South Carolina for reference.

      Option 1: 

Interest rate: 3.375%
APR: 3.568%
Closing costs: $7596
TIP: 37.66%

5 year total and principal numbers: $51711/$25105

      Option 2: 

Interest rate: 3.625%
APR: 3.807%
Closing costs: $6334
TIP: 40.965%

5 year total and principal numbers: $50928/$24572

APR: 3.721%
Closing costs: $8575
TIP: 36.34%

5 year total and principal numbers: $51169/$25372

From what I'm seeing it seems like the lenders adjust the interest rate and the closing costs so they are inversely proportional so as the interest rate goes down the closing costs go up so it really just depends on if you want to pay now or later. Is this a valid assumption?

Also do these rates seem reasonable for someone putting 20% down with good credit(FICO around 750 and other scores around 790+)? It seems like all of them are fairly close so if anyone has any recommendations on which option to go with or any other lenders to try I would appreciate it.

financialindependence,Military FIRE (enlisted perspective),"First, let me preface this by saying that this post is merely about the FIRE benefits of military service. I understand that you will have your own personal thoughts on military service, politics, foreign relations, etc…but those topics are best suited for other subreddits.

One thing I have noticed with most Military FIRE blogs and [r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/) posts is that they are written by, and geared towards, officers. For those that are not familiar with the military construct there are Enlisted members and Officers. Officers are a small portion of the military and get paid much more than the enlisted folks, due to some prior knowledge or accomplishments.

The overwhelming majority of military members are enlisted. I’ve been enlisted for 12 years so I can fully relate. I feel like there is a misunderstanding in society and the thought is that the military is underpaid. I have read countless news stories about fast food workers earning more than enlisted military members, but they are ignoring all of the pay allowances that we get (more on that later).

This post is meant to highlight why I believe the military is unmatched in it’s ability to steer someone down the path to FIRE. I spent 4.5 years as a Drill Instructor at bootcamp and would tell the new members in my flights that this is their chance to achieve the American Dream. Once you enlist in the military it doesn’t matter your race, religion, socio-economic upbringing, education level, etc… It’s an even playing field and 20 years later you are set for life.

What are the major topics that get discussed in this subreddit and occupy your mind when you get time to think?

First is taxes! Let’s take me for example. I’m an enlisted guy that has been in for 12 years. That means for my rank, my base pay is $4,800. So you are thinking, $50,000 a year…that’s not too bad, but far from enough to invest a large amount. What the general public fails to understand is that is our only taxed income. I’m a family of 3 and only get taxed as though I make $4,800 a month. Now here is the tax advantaged part of the military. I also get “allowances” which are not taxed. I’m overseas and get my $1,300 rent paid (OHA), $350 a month for Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), $350 for food (BAS) and $700 for utilities. All told I make $90,000 a year and get taxed on only $57,600.

Let’s take it one step further. Since I am in the military my state of residence does not require me to pay state taxes and reimburses me everything I pay in when I file my taxes.

We all know the benefits of tax advantaged investing and it is no different for us. In 2018 I maxed out my 401K. That means that instead of being taxed on my $4,800 base pay, I was only being taxed on $3,300 a month since I invested $1,500.

Now it came time to file my taxes. I’m a family of 3 making only “$36,000” a year. Throughout 2018 about $5,000 were taken out of my paycheck for State and all the various Federal taxes. When I filed my taxes, given the tax breaks for my “low income” and all of my State taxes returned back to me, I got a tax refund of $5,000.

All told, I earned $90,000 and paid zero taxes. I have yet to find a profession that can match those kinds of tax advantages.

What else gets talked about in this subreddit? College expenses! Whether it is your own student loans or figuring out how to pay for your children’s college, it is a serious FIRE hurdle. As a military member I do not have to worry about either of those. Each year I receive $4,500 to pay for college classes. If earning a degree is important to you, you can do it and incur no debt. Another great option is the ability to transfer your GI Bill to your dependents. I have a young son and have already transferred my GI Bill to him. What this means is that when he goes to college the military will pay for all the college expenses for 4 years and pay him a monthly housing stipend. Not having the burden of college expenses is a great way to speed up the FIRE process.

It seems a large portion of the users on this subreddit are from America. This naturally drives the conversation about healthcare. (I’m currently stationed in Europe, you guys do it right!). While in the military you are covered under what is called TRICARE. Essentially it is the health insurance plan most Department of Defense employees and their family members fall under. While in the military the base you are at will have most of the facilities you need for any medical treatment, but if not you will be referred off base. You pay no copays and no monthly fees, it is all free! Additionally, after you retire you will be enrolled in TRICARE Prime. The cost of healthcare for you and your family will be a grand total of $600 a year.

So you are paying no taxes during your working years, incurring no college debt, not needing to pay for your child’s college and have no healthcare expenses to plan for. Next comes the topic of funding your FIRE lifestyle. The military retirement plan that existed when I enlisted allows me to retire after 20 years of service and immediately start receiving a pension (if you were to enlist today the rules have changed a bit, but it is still an incredible deal).

What does that mean? It means that for almost all early retirees they are mostly relying on the Trinity studies’ 4% withdrawal rate. My wife and I follow all of the FIRE principles and save about 60% of our income, this should leave us with about $1M when we retire. I like the idea of Fat FIRE and $1M is only $40,000 a year. The beauty of the military pension is that as soon as you retire (for me I’ll be 43) you start receiving an inflation adjusted pension. For the sake of math, we’ll say by the time I retire my base pay will be $6,000. I will receive half of that in perpetuity. Now all of the sudden instead of having $4,000 a month in retirement, I will have $7,000 a month.

Do you start out making as much as I do now? No. But this is a lesson in lifestyle inflation. As a young enlisted member you will live in a dorm on base. You eat at a dining facility and pay nothing for food. Your dorm is free, the gym on base is free, you don’t need much of a wardrobe because you wear a uniform to work, you don’t need a car because you can bike this short distances on base and all the while you are still receiving your base pay. As you progress through the ranks resist the urge to Hedonically adapt. I can’t tell you how many people I have talked to on the brink of retirement that are stressed about making the payment on their ridiculous dually truck and 35 foot camper!!

I know this is a long post but it has been rattling around in my head for a long time and I just wanted to get it on paper. This is merely my experience and I understand everyone’s journey/experience/story is unique. For any enlisted folks out there I would love to talk with you about your journey!",finance

personalfinance,Pros and Cons of 457 vs 401(k) vs Pension.,"A little background:

I'm 23 and started working at a NYC government job that like protects the environment or something (I love it). Anyways I plan on staying here for the foreseeable future. I may leave after 5 years but will most likely come back to continue with the pension program. Not sure if that matters.

I have been enrolled in their pension plan and also have a Vanguard Roth IRA I've been contributing to since I started working last August. Also, I have a Robinhood account with some money which I don't really ever touch.

My questions are as follows;

* In general, what are the pros and cons of the 457, 401(k), and a pension plan?
* Can I have a combination of:  *~~a pre-tax 401(k) and a Roth IRA? If yes, what are the benefits?~~*
   * **Pre-tax 401(k) and a Roth 401(k)?**
   * **Traditional IRA and Roth IRA?**
   * **Pre-tax 401(k) and a Roth IRA?**
* Similar question but what single or combination of accounts would be best to have given you contribute a set amount in the one or divided into multiple accounts?
* Should I roll over my vanguard Roth IRA to my company's Roth *~~IRA~~* **401(k)**, or should I leave it?
* Should I open a pre-tax 401(k) **or a traditional IRA** in addition to my Roth IRA? If yes, see below.
* My company offers a*~~n IRA~~* **401(k)** with pre-arranged portfolios. Should I go with vanguard traditional IRA or my company's pre-tax ~~IRA~~ 401(k)?
   * (Don't know anything about administrative/management fees. But I currently have my money in the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (Settlement fund) for my Roth IRA. And I would like to do a pre-tax 401(k) with the NYC Deferred Compensation plan)
* What to do with my Robinhood account. I don't really like to use it and really have no interest in it. Should I leave the stocks (\~$1200) or sell them and then transfer the money to another brokerage account I have in Vanguard?

That's all my questions so far lol.

I'm still trying to learn the lingo and figure what I'm doing so if anything is confusing please let me know.

personalfinance,Legal name change impacting my student loan recertification.,"Hi Everyone,

In the last year I got married, and my wife went through the process of having her name legally changed. Fast forward to now, where I am trying to recertify my Income-Driven Repayment plan (we both work in education).  


Since getting married, part of the process is to have my wife sign into her own profile on studentloans.gov, and 'co-sign,' using a reference number and my SS#. When she tries to sign in, it says that her information does not match; it gives her access to her account, but all she can do is update her information, she can't complete the co-signing process. The co-signing must be completed for me to recertify, or I will be paying thousands a month in loans.  
  
Even though she legally changed her name (new SS card, ID, etc) and she changed her name in her FSA account, it's not recognized. The only solutions I find are saying to change her name on her FAFSA, but my concern is that will mess up her own loans (she is serviced by FedLoan and we had no problem logging into her account last night)
  
Has anyone else encountered this issue with a legal name change? I still have a month to recertify, but I'm freaking out that it will get bogged down in the beraucracy that is the PSLF system. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!",finance

I have some major home repairs that I need to do before selling my house to move to a new school district, and I'd like to pay off some CC debt as well.

I don't really want to be saddled with the monthly payment, but if I just withdraw the $ I will obviously lose out on the return from the money from my 401k. Already tried to get a home equity loan, but was turned down because of the CC debt, hence my desire to pay it off.

personalfinance,Dropping out of School with a School Loan,"So I started school at SJVC about 2 months ago. I had to pull out a school loan to do so, about $17,000 in total.

I wanted to just make drastic changes to make everything different. I got a job the same week school started my classes. The first class was a breeze but I was skeptical that this was something I even wanted to do. I passed the class and am now on week 2 of the next 2 courses and I simply cannot handle working, full time school, and being a single mother. Plus I actually really hate school. 

I know I will still have to pay back the schooling I have already done but I'm not sure what my options are here with going thru with this and also afterwards because I know for a fact I will not be able to afford to pay that back anytime soon.

Update; I spoke with my financial advisor who handles my loan stuff thru the school and it's all being handled. Because I'm so early on and I also have a Pell grant it should pay for most if not all of the debt ive incurred during my short time there. She put the paperwork in and i will find out within approximately 2 weeks if I do and the amount and go from there on setting up paying it back. The loan will also be sent back to the federal aid so that wont go against me. Fingers crossed everything turns out fine. Thanks for all the encouragement / advice it was much appreciated.",finance

I already called for work to increase my HSA, but not to the limit. I think I would still lose about a thousand dollars or so of tax exempt ""space"" in my hsa for this year. 

I have 14.5k of student loans, but the interest rate is 2.1 percent variable and I have 4.75 years left on it. I was going to refinance it once or twice more, I stand to make 400 when it is refinanced at the end of the month, which should get me 300 post tax. The original term of the loan was 5 years, so like approx 90% of the payment is going towards the principal.

I am not very worried about the loan, and am more concerned about growing my financial assets for the long run, and the 30 dollars or so of interest each month is not that big of a deal.

I have about 33k in my HSA+Roth IRA+company 401k as a mid 20 something, but I feel very behind because I am in a city where there are lots of lawyers and doctors who have more top end room to increase their earnings every year. Mine will go up next year and is in part variable, but it isn't as linear as being a fancy lawyer who makes 10k more every year more or less by default.

I know holding the course is the right thing to do, but how heavily should I lean in to the extra saving with the roth and HSA? 

I may wait till EOY for the skates since my family is moving too, which will give me a little more room financially.

personalfinance,"Refinance and pay off student loans faster, or invest the difference?","Hey,

I have ~70k in student loans. The total average interest rate is 4.7%, but they are a bunch of different loans (17) at different rates that they can roughly be broken into 5 buckets: 

- ~10k at 3.15%
- ~13k at 3.61%
- ~3.5k at 4.25%
- ~13k at 5.04%
- ~30k at 5.7%

My current minimum payment is somehow only ~$400 split between all of these loans. I was looking at refinance options, and it seems like I qualify for fixed 5 year rates are around 3.8-4% with estimated monthly payments of about $1250-$1300.

It seems like I have 2 options (or a mix of them):

I refinance at 3.77%, with a payment of $1288 per month, which I have been offered from Earnest. Over those five years, I would spend $888 more per month on loans, and in 5 years, would be at $0 debt and I would have spent a total of $77,280, which makes me believe I spent ~$7,280 in interest. After 5 years, my net is $0. 

Now let's consider that I keep paying the minimum payment of $400 per month, and invest the $888 per month in the S&amp;P 500. After 5 years, assuming a modest ROI of 6%, I will have ~$57.4k balance on the loans, and ~$60k in the brokerage account. After 5 years, my net is ~$2.6k.

Looking 10 years from now, in the refinance option, assuming I then pay the total $1288 for 5 years, giving me ~$87k with 6% returns, so my net is $87k.

In the other one, my loan has decreased to $46.8k, but my brokerage has increased to ~$140k, so my net worth is $93.2k.

Assuming I took this to the extreme, my payoff date would be ~22 years from now in the worst case. At year 22, I will have invested $1288 for 17 years, so my net is ~436k.

When I finally reached my payoff date making minimum payments, I will have invested $888 for 22 years, or ~462k.

If you consider 8% ROI, it becomes $522k (refi) or $590k (pay mins). So it seems like those extra five years become a big difference later on.

Seems like paying the minimums here is actually beneficial to me in the long run, because I can let compound interest really do its thing, and keeps cash flow available in an emergency (minimum of $400 vs $1288).

There is also a middle option: crush the 5.7% loans until those are gone and then make minimum payments on the rest. 

For simplicity, assume that I have 1 loan of $40k at 4% interest and one at $30k for 5.7% interest. I would pay off the 5.7% one in 3 years paying $920 (roughly min payment + 888), and the $40k loan in 11 years paying $375 per month. At year 11, I have 8 years years of investing $920 per month into the S&amp;P 500, which will be ~$116k. I then have 11 years of investing $1288, which ends me with a total balance of ~$465k at 6%. Unsurprisingly, this is roughly the same as above because of the difference between 5.7% and 6%, but at 8% ROI, it would end up at ~574k. 

So it seems like, if I expect a ROI of &gt;6%, making the minimum payments is optimal. 

I can think of two reasons to *not* go with the minimum-payment approach:
1. Skipping any investments, especially at the beginning, kills this whole plan. I have enough room in the budget that this is not really a concern for me right now, but I understand that there could be temptation to change it.
2. Tax implications of the investments. My employer offers an after-tax 401k that you can roll into a roth IRA/401k, so it seems like the tax implications there are not really a concern for me. I would be paying my loans with after tax money or investing after-tax money, and the gains/withdrawals are free, so it doesn't really matter. 
3. Feel good feels about being debt free. This one I am not so sure about. I used to have ~85k in student loans, and I threw &gt;$10k at it from my yearly bonus this year. I have enjoyed watching my investments go up more than I have enjoyed seeing my loans go down (I have more than $70k in retirement accounts, so I have a positive net worth).

It's worth noting that I am already maxing my HSA/401k/IRA every year, and now that I have a raise, I am considering what to do with that *extra* money.

Anything else I should consider before withdrawing my refi?",finance

* **Loan B:** (Subsidized, Interest Rate 5.05%)

investing,Hard Money Lending as an Investment,"I'm just posting here to gauge people's thoughts on Hard Money Lending as a form of investment. I am by no means very well-versed in hard money lending (or real estate at all, for that matter), as I am still new to investing.  


As I understand it, hard money lending is when you loan some money (usually a smaller amount than a traditional loan) to someone for a real estate purchase. People often resort to hard money lenders when they cannot qualify for a traditional loan. This is inherently a little more risky, though there are scenarios in which one may not qualify for a traditional loan currently, but is still considered a ""safe bet"" - for example someone who just spent a lot of money to expand their business across the country, etc. Hard money loans typically have higher interest rates (8\~10%), which sounds pretty appealing.  


The high interest rate feels pretty appealing to me, but again I am new to all of this. Would you personally recommend hard money lending as a form of an investment? Is this far more risky high-risk investing in the stock market? What are some of the barriers of entry into hard money lending?

personalfinance,Refinance Jumbo Mortgage? (US),"Going through the calculations and wanted some opinions on whether it would be a good idea to refinance.  We have been in our house for a year.  I think we will likely stay here another 6-7 years at least.  Reason for refinance is to save on paying total interest not concerned as much with monthly payments. Both my wife and I have excellent credit, both physicians, healthy e-fund, and retirement accounts, and can afford the house if one of us loses our job or is disabled.  Both already max out tax advantaged retirement plans / prime directive etc..

Current situation:
Home original loan 543k @4.25% 15 year
Current Balance 512k (14 years left)

Want to refinance.  Best rate I could find was my credit union who posts 3.0 % interest/3.25% APR on a 12 year (affinity plus (I don't work for them)).  If anyone has anything better I am all ears. Closing costs are 8700$ or so. I think that should be rolled into the APR, but please correct me if wrong.

Since it is a jumbo loan my guess is that I would have to do a lump sum payment of 30k to get it down into a conventional loan area or maybe just refinance to a jumbo loan.  I can ask if they would do a jumbo loan re-fi, based on the other numbers posted it would likely add 0.125%

My calculations show that if I keep paying what I am now.
I will have paid 192k in total interest (assuming we stay the whole 15 years)
if I just add an extra 1k to  the monthly payment it will shave off 3 years from the loan (similar to a 12 year) and we would pay 150k in interest (this would save interest, but I would rather invest that money in my taxable investment account rather than give it to the bank).  Other option is to do the refinance:  Here are the numbers/scenarios i came up with.  The Final option is refinance to a conventional but pay down by 30k to get to under the conventional loan limit 484k

** Leave it be @4.25% ( Total Cost 736k, total interest 192k) I have paid 27k in interest so far.

** Add 1k more to monthly payment Total 691k Saved 44k in interest (though lose out on investment gains)

** Refinance to Jumbo @3.375% : Total cost 627k Total interest 142k (115k + 27k) ~ 50 k savings

** Refiance to Conventional @3.25%: Total Cost 615k (585 + 30k to qualify for conventional), Total interest (128k)  101 k + 27k  (~64k interest saved)

It seems that either of the bottom 2 are reasonable options.  The 2nd to last option lets me keep the 30k cash and use it to put in my investment account.  I would save maybe 12k in interest, but may be losing out on market gains.
I could also wait until around next year sometime for when the loan gets into the conventional area, but interest rates will likely rise by then making it a wash.

Would appreciate any comments or corrections if my math is wrong (its getting late)",finance

Car insurance: $85
Fuel(when not floating for work): $60-80

Food: $150

This leaves me with $780/month which sounds about right.  My employer offers a 50% contribution of 6% salary which would give me effectively 9% plus I believe a 2% stock share I believe was noted as well after my first year of employment. I have been here for a little over a month now. Should I start investing in it now so I can get used to the money coming out of my paycheck? Or wait until I get the match? My expected annual pay is $17,500 and I work a second job as well which my expected pay is $5,500 which gives me $23k/year. When I do start I do plan on starting with a Roth 401k so I can pay taxes now while I am in the lowest bracket I’ll (hopefully) be in. I do plan on staying here long term (at the very least until I’m done with college) and everyone is super impressed with how well I do at my job as well. I do have plans in the near future to eventually finance a car, looking around the $7k range Max, but also wouldn’t mind Saving up for one to pay in cash fully. With me sometimes traveling for my job which also pays me 0.58¢ per mile, the mileage pay I get can fluctuate depending on whether I’m sent out 20 minutes away, or 1 hour away, or right in town where I am based out of in which case I don’t get the mileage pay. I also get commission on products sold as well. I’m not quite sure if I should wait to see what I average per month, or if I should wait until I get the employer match, or if I should start investing in it now.

Since 2017 (thru July 31, 2019), the [**FAA reported a total of 121 air/airport incidents**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bHiYl44y3no7wjvIde8mlhcqVYsdfq06EtL08qns0Zd4UklHjDlOUeZ-h65uzWbwlBEybtsZPB4chqV7sC-zoqS943U3fTeKzMbtJvInGr1x1WlFYTAaAFjq1eAbaVL-9FrGbuAlOTgQUW0AUU_HwLm0ArnfuWx_8YY3nuYey3vaUvI9CAdo5GSmXq4LEKLzEfn6Y7DBVHi4f6eXz9Ju4g==) involving smoke, fire, extreme heat, or explosion due to lithium ion batteries.

“Battery failures are a clear and present danger in many areas but especially in airline travel where spaces are confined and response and assistance resources are limited,” said Mo. “That’s why we’re excited to present our proven solutions, the same ones NASA and other partners are using, to aviation and aircraft experts at this conference. I am hopeful that, together, we can make air travel safer for everyone.”

The conference, themed ""Improving Safety Through Data Driven Innovation,"" will also feature presentations from United Parcel Service, Boeing, Underwriters Laboratories (UL), the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Airbus, NASA, GE Aviation, Northrup Grumman, the FAA and others.

personalfinance,Student loan interest rate question,"Hi all! First time posting here. 

A little background. I’m a recent college graduate and landed myself with about 50k of student loan debt. The good part is they are all federal loans with fixed interest rates. 30k of it are in my name that I haven’t started paying yet (in deferment) and the other 20k is a parent plus loan that is in my mothers name but I am the sole person making payments on it and have been since June. 

The current balance on my parent plus loan is 18k at a 6.8% interest rate. I moved back home to aggressively pay off my loans and I have allotted 2k in my budget to pay off my loans (1500 for this loan and 500 for the loans in my name). This loan, by far out of all my other loans, has the highest interest rate.

I feel like my only option to get a lower interest rate would be to get a personal loan with a lower  interest rate. My stepdad had told me he got a loan for a car with 0% interest rate for the first year. With my budget I will get this loan paid off in 13 months. Should I look into getting a personal loan or just focus on keep paying off as much of it has a can the way it is? My FICO score is 763 and I have had 6 paychecks so far. I make a little bit more than 3k a month. 

I’m trying to pay off all my debt in 2 years and just trying to make it the easiest way possible.",finance

personalfinance,"My student loans were put in deferment. Should I cancel, or make optional payments?","My loans for my undergrad were automatically put into deferment because I am now in grad school. I have been paying them for about three and a half years now and am 1/3 done. My minimum monthly payment is $175, most of the time I can afford this. If I'm doing well that month, I pay $200-$250 which lowers my next month's payment. But I always try to get ahead if I can. I got to the point where each month, $0 was due, but I still paid at least $100.

My question is, my loans are deferred but can still acquire interest if I have an outstanding unpaid interest (I don't believe I do, maybe someone can help me understand this). I can either cancel the deferment and continue with my regular payments, or keep deferment and make payments when I can. I am wondering if it would be more beneficial to go back to my regular payments, or keep my deferment and still make payments each month, just having the freedom to skip some months if an unexpected expense pops up.

Some basic finances to put my situation into perspective:
- I will not have additional loans for grad school, it is being paid for by my work.
- Currently, I am paying $225 for another loan that is technically in a parent's name, so it does not get deferred
- I also have about $5000 in credit card debt that I have been paying off. I do not make any additional charges on it in an effort to get it paid off. I try to pay off more than the minimum, but some months are really hard and this has been a super slow process.
- My loans/debt are currently my biggest money drainer. I do not spend money on to much else, except occasionally eating out which I am trying to fully stop.
- My student loan has an interest rate of 3.8%, one CC is 13.55% and another is 19.24%

personalfinance,New boss is now declining previously incurred expenses that old boss was approving,"I apologize for the post length, as I have a tendency to overexplain. For some background information, my friend and I both work for the same company, but this is his situation, not mine.  
  
We both work for a company that has lots of working locations all over our state with lots of job sites. Originally, my friend reported to the headquarters building (HQ) which is over an hour drive from his house. In May/June, he got put on a temporary assignment with another department that works in a different building (Building A) about 10 minutes further from his house (aka 10 minutes from HQ). Typically in these situations, the administrative staff move an employee to the temporary department in the organizational system for the duration of the assignment and then move them back at the end. This results in his contact information being updated across the directory systems as well as the payroll/accounting (read: expense reporting) system. As far as the chain of command on paper goes, the employee reports to management in the new department. What _also_ typically happens is employees on temporary assignments end up liking their assignments and stay in the new departments, leaving the old departments shorthanded. In my friend's case, they moved him to the new department, but his management had him moved back because they were already short staffed (his management is also short staffed--currently, the manager and general manager positions between my friend's supervisor and director are vacant).  
  
The new department also has a building (Building B) close to my friend's house (about a 10 minute drive) and his new supervisor (without asking) organized a reporting location transfer for him. So for the past few weeks, my friend's official reporting location on paper has been Building B, while he still reports to his original management. Because of this, any time he has gone to Building A for a meeting or has gone on a site visit, he has taken his personal car and submitted the miles for reimbursement on an expense report, subtracting the commute to Building B (14 miles round trip) from the total. His expense reports have been approved up to this point. Expense reports are approved by the first manager above a supervisor; in my friend's case, his expense reports are approved by his director.  
  
It was recently announced that the director of my friend's original department is retiring and his replacement was named. The replacement took over the director role in the past week and my friend submitted an expense report (our system uses a weekly report) for about $200 for some travel to a job site and to Building A for a meeting. He got a call today from the replacement director, who said (rather condescendingly) he wouldn't be reimbursing the expenses. As far as the replacement director is concerned, the new department never should have changed his reporting location from HQ to either Building A or Building B. The only agreement was that the original department would pay the difference in miles from HQ to Building A (about 8 miles round trip) and that the manager in the new department had no authority to instruct my friend to submit expenses for trips from home to Building A, since on paper he is still in his original department. In other words, any expense reports he submits for mileage on a personal vehicle should subtract his commute from home to HQ (112 miles round trip).  
  
My friend can't really afford to be out $200 right now. What advice would you give him to get reimbursed for these expenses?  
  
EDIT: For clarification, my friend actually works in building B during this assignment, not just on paper. His supervisor/director are still the ones from the original department (located at HQ), but the organizational system accurately reflects where he physically conducts his job duties during the temporary assignment (which is building B). His temporary supervisor got him transferred closer to home because there was space available at building B and because it greatly reduced his commute.",finance

personalfinance,"Does it make sense to add mortgage refinancing costs to new mortgage, or is it advantageous to pay out of pocket?","With mortgage rates so low, our mortgage loan officer suggested a refinance from our current 10 yr ARM to a 30 yr fixed at a lower rate. The cost of the refi is $1,500(all costs included) and will reduce our interest rate by 0.75%, which results in a 18 month break even period.

I have the option of adding the 1,500 to the loan or to pay that out of pocket. Pros are not needing to pay that amount right now and rather paying $6.60/ month instead. My perceived con is reducing our equity in the home by that added amount to the loan.

personalfinance,Deductibility of Below Market Student Loans (provider not recipient),"I am fortunate enough to have been able to go to school without having to accrue any student debt but have learned from friends and experience how challenging it can be to shift the cycle for people who incur huge debts and can take generations to get ahead.

I also have a friend that has been very successful and endows a scholarship for students each year to the tune of $25k.

I'm not at that point (by far) but would love to get there eventually, in the meantime I was wondering if there would be any mechanism to provide below market loans (e.g. 0%) to students that would be otherwise eligible for federal or private loans (currently 4.45% at the federal rate), and then have the interest subvention be taken as a deduction for the person providing the loan.

This could be used as a positive way to give back but also as a tax hedge for people that have had the benefits and associated wealth that comes from higher education.  I'd love to even package it with a peer to peer mentoring, but a lot of this would hinge on the tax portion first...

personalfinance,Fraudulent Purchase Advice Needed,"Okay, this is going to be long so please bear with me!!

Over the weekend (Sept 22, to be exact), someone somehow gained access to my checking account (Chase) and my emails. I grew aware of this because Chase texted me asking if I had spent $1400 at an electronics store. So I immediately called. I'm a broke college student, I barely have $1400 in my checking account as is. 

I opened my account to look at it--it had been overdrawn into oblivion. I talked to Chase and they cancelled my card, sent a new one, and assured me my money would be returned (which it since has been returned). 

Anyways, it turns out this person who used my card tried to spend $1400 at Apple. SOMEHOW, they managed to connect my phone number to their purchase. So I received a text saying something like, ""Congrats! Your purchase at Apple has been made, we'll let you know when it ships."" I was annoyed with the whole situation, so I ignored it. 

This morning, I got a text saying, ""Good news! Your Apple order has shipped!"" And something in me kind of snapped. I basically was like, Hell no, this person IS NOT going to  be rewarded with free Apple stuff because they stole my info. So on and so forth. So I got on chat with Apple. I knew the order number (because it was given in the text). I also had my cell phone number, which was linked to the purchase (somehow). And obviously I knew all the billing info because it was purchased ""by me"". 

I first spoke to Dan at Apple. He told me that they had purchased an iPhone something or other (I am not an Apple person so I'm clueless about Apple stuff), and a set of Airpods. The airpods had already shipped and nothing could be done, according to Dan. He WAS able to cancel the iPhone purchase. I jokingly said, ""hey why not just change the shipping address if they've already been sent out."" I figured he'd say hell no, not an option, why would we send anyone anything for free. And I was 10000% joking. Then I had to ditch the chat because, as I said, I'm a student. I had an exam I had to start taking, so I had no choice but to end the chat. 

I came back out of my exam, and I find that I have all sorts of notifications. Dan has switched the shipment to ship to ME. So now these airpods are with Fedex on their way to my address. And there was no info attached. Just an email saying airpods were being shipped to me.

Dan also managed to link my email to the order. So now I had full control over the order status, etc. I logged in to check out what the heck was happening. The order was indeed shipping to me. There was another email listed as ""sharing updates"". It was the email of the person who had fraudulently ordered the stuff in the first place. I tried to remove it and was told I couldn't. Then I was basically like, ""Am I going to be in trouble for getting these airpods? What happens now?""

So I got on chat AGAIN, with Isaiah at Apple. And Isaiah listened to the whole thing and was like, ""oh no."" And after all that, he told me they needed to be returned and that Dan was wrong and should not have done this yadda yadda yadda. So now these airpods are shipping to me (although Isaiah is trying to stop the shipment-something Dan told me couldn't be done). And I need to return them if they come.

&amp;#x200B;

I just have a hypothetical question about this whole thing. If I kept them (which I know, totally dishonest and I shouldn't), what would repercussions be? Could Apple do anything about it? This is just me being curious, I'm too honest of a person and will absolutely return them. I just like to know how things work. Isaiah even initially told me, ""oh if you keep them you have to pay for them--BUT based on what I see here, you already did pay for them."" I did, but I got the money back because it was fraudulent, so I'm so confused on this whole thing.

Also, my other question: Did I handle this whole thing correctly? Like I said, I'm a student. I've never had to deal with anything like this before. Did I take all the right steps? Is there anything else I should have done or should do now? Thanks!",finance

Bitcoin,These dips are a chance to get BTC to unprecedented levels and more importantly take power away from the governments and large corporations and put it back into your own hands.,"This is a cal to arms, so to speak, regarding the current price levels and an opportunity for EVERYBODY to stand up to what they believe from the very inception of this digital asset. The price of Bitcoin may be falling, and everybody may be crying foul or manipulation, but the truth of the matter is you have to take a look at the motives for each interested group:

1. Governments want Bitcoin to fail because they do not wish to have the value of the gold they hold to be devalued in light of a new asset class like Bitcoin. They also do not want their fiat currency to suffer from inflation or lose value because of Bitcoin. So they will try everything in their best interests to suppress the price and manipulate it.

2. Many people have been preaching that institutional money is coming in. If institutional money is coming in, realize that they’re not just looking for their self interests in acquiring as much BTC as possible by suppressing the price and buying at low prices. Be weary - many of these large corporations are linked heavily to governments and it wouldn’t be surprising that they have a larger stake or interest from the government than their gain from the Bitcoin protocol. This holds particularly true for companies like Alibaba (with WeChat pay for the entire country of China), and other totalitarian governments more so than utilitarian or free market governments. Don’t let these corporations cajole you into selling your BTC or lose your faith in Bitcoin.

With the governments on the brink of economic disaster due to the negative interest rates rising around the entire world, an asset class needs to be provided for the people who choose to opt out of this economic mess. That has no borders, no limits, and has no restrictions. It’s time to buy some more Bitcoin.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Looking for suggestions to payoff mortgage within the next 5 years.,"Hi Folks,

My wife (28) and I (30) are looking for ways to payoff our home within the next 5 years. I'm not necessarily looking to retire early (however, my wife does). We would like the flexibility and ease of mind that having our mortgage paid off would bring.

Debt:

* $135k left on our mortgage (started September 2016). It's a 15 year loan at a 2.625% interest rate. 
* Student loans, totaling about $15k, with interest rates between 4.5-6.8%. 
* We have our first child coming in january. This will definitely complicate things, im sure, but we've already made several preparations at this point to lessen the financial impact. Both of us are taking parental leave next year, both paid. 
* No additional debts. Car and CC are both paid off.

Savings:

* $75k. We're going to nuke our student loans before the end of the year, which will set us back to roughly $60k. 
* I contribute the company match for my 401k ($50k), as well as contribute 3% of my income to ESPP (roughly $7k in stock)

Income:

* We both make around $55k at base, but I have lots of OT opportunities, so that brings me up to about 70-80k depending on the year. Overall, probably $125k on average. 
* She's an elementary teacher, so there's virtually no opportunity for an increase. I'm a SQL dev, and, I believe, that I am underpaid for what I provide, so I'm looking at new opportunities to increase my base.

Considerations:

* Roughly 5 years from today, we will owe 85k on our mortgage. At this point, I would guesstimate that we would have more than enough saved up at this point (assuming no hardship), to payoff the mortgage. I would like to have about 20k additional saved over, just in case of an emergency. 
* After our student loans have been wiped out, I've thought about throwing 50% of whatever else is saved, and throwing it into a mutual fund to accelerate the process (possibly getting it paid off by 3 year mark, if returns are good.)

I think I could pay up to $5000 a month on these loans but my income is variable. I'm so nervous about leaving fed loan for a private company. Should I stay in the somewhat safety of my current situation in order to have the meager benefits of a public loan and a shot at loan forgiveness if that happens (I don't think it will), or go to a private company? When I play around with a snowball calculator the results don't seem to be that large - I'd obviously pay less interest with a private loan but it wouldn't take that much longer (less than 6 months).

cardano,Unboxing the blockchain – the Shelley testnet making its network debut,"**After a successful test run in London, the networked testnet is now available to the community**

&amp;#x200B;

Official IOHK:[https://iohk.io/blog/unboxing-the-blockchain-shelley-testnet-making-its-network-debut/](https://iohk.io/blog/unboxing-the-blockchain-shelley-testnet-making-its-network-debut/)

&amp;#x200B;

Re-post for Reddit:

Last week, a team from IOHK, along with Cardano ambassadors and representatives from the Cardano Foundation, met up at a co-working space in London. After a quick presentation, laptops were switched on and a few Rock Pi computers were booted up. An hour later, we had them all connected in a peer-to-peer network of nodes. It was the first instance of the new networked Shelley testnet, available for the community to join as of today.

A recent post about the [Shelley testnet](https://iohk.io/blog/taking-the-next-step-on-the-road-to-cardano-shelley/) covered the journey from the self-node phase of the testnet until now. This new phase is the first decentralized implementation of the Ouroboros Genesis consensus algorithm. While it’s still early days, this is an important milestone for the Shelley era of Cardano.

The networked testnet phase allows IOHK – and more importantly, the community – to test the behavior of an Ouroboros-based decentralized network before making changes to mainnet. The current Cardano mainnet operates on a federated model, with all nodes in the network controlled by either the Cardano Foundation, IOHK, or EMURGO. As a project, the ultimate goal is complete decentralization, with the majority of nodes run by the community. Not only does that goal pose an engineering challenge, but the change must be sustainable for the network to flourish in the long term, so it has to be achieved in an incremental way.

After less than a year of development, debugging, and troubleshooting, the project is close to realizing complete network decentralization – but it can’t happen all at once. Steps are being taken to ensure this is done correctly. The ‘private’ network we initially set up in London allowed us to see the networked testnet operating in real-time, and to capture crucial information about its behavior in a live context.

This network is being built for the real world, but the real world is unpredictable. By testing the network capabilities in different scenarios, it’s possible to learn more and account for a broader set of variables. To derive understanding from real-world scenarios, wider community participation is required.

That’s where you come in. With the release of the networked testnet, we’re inviting the community to help Cardano take things to the next level by running your own nodes and participating in the network. We encourage everyone to take part, and to help, we’ve made [documentation and instructions](https://testnet.iohkdev.io/cardano/shelley/) available to you.

We’ve already seen a brilliant response from the community during the self-node phase of the testnet. From today, we are inviting anyone who is interested to download and install the [latest version of the testnet node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/jormungandr/releases/)and connect to the networked testnet.

We want to collect performance data in all circumstances and multiple use cases. So try to run a node from your local coffee shop, see if it works with their proxy. Try it from the free hotel Wi-Fi. Check out how it reacts with the firewall. All this ‘real world’ data is useful and the more communication we get from our community, the better. We are not expecting full stability at this point; by putting the network through its paces, we can get there, faster.

The Cardano ecosystem is built to be a community-focused decentralized network. As Shelley approaches, the ambassadors and supporters are integral to working through upcoming challenges, alongside technical support from the IOHK team. We expect instability in any testnet. There will be outages and lag in the network at the beginning, but that is inherent to all new platforms. With every iteration, we lay a stronger foundation for the future.

There will continue to be regular updates in the [Jörmungandr GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/jormungandr/releases/), where you can download the latest release of the testnet code. This codebase will be iterated on and improved over time based on bug reports and user feedback, with the goal of making the network as robust as possible before we move towards phase three of the rollout later this year: the incentivized testnet.

personalfinance,TSP Advice for 24 year old,"Hello I was hired October last year as a federal employee starting at the matching 5% for the TSP. Since I was hired I have kept increasing the % and am currently contributing 25% per paycheck biweekly. Comes out to a little under $400 a paycheck in contributions.

This week I found out that about all the different funds you can choose, L G F C S I. My account was set at 100% L2050 by default. I am only 24 years old and am wondering if I should change the %s around or not.

I am not a investing guru and have no intentions of doing alot of investing research. If its as simple as changing the investment allocations every 10 years I dont mind.

I currently have a little under $5k in my TSP sitting at 100% L2050. I am 24 years old, my salary is 40,052.00 at Grade D Step 00. 

Any advice is appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Got car loan in June.. have enough to pay it off. Is that a good idea?,"Hiya guys.

I’m a 19 year old student with a pretty decent job. I got a 30 month loan early this summer to buy a really nice NA Miata I’ve been keeping my eyes on. The loan amount was somewhere around $5500. From working my butt off over summer, I managed to save up enough to just pay it off early. This was originally my plan, since I didn’t want it to slip away into someone else’s hands.

I’ve made 4 payments on it. That left about 4500 left on it. I put $2000 on it last night, and was wondering if it was a good idea to pay the rest off today.

I’d like to pay it off and get an loan on an car I can use in winter, as my Miata is more of a summer only car, especially in Wisconsin where our winters are nasty.

Wondering what you guys think. Pay it off? Leave it on for a couple months? My interest rate is somewhere around 4.5%.",finance
investing,"The Fed will need to grow its balance sheet ‘permanently,’ Morgan Stanley says","&gt;The Federal Reserve's asset purchases likely will total $315 billion over the next six months as it seeks to stabilize overnight funding markets and contain the movements of its target interest rate, according to projections from Morgan Stanley.

&gt;Those permanent moves will be necessary because the current temporary purchases likely won't be enough to stabilize the market for overnight purchase agreements, or repos, the bank said. 

...

&gt;Gerson said the Fed has a number of options for how it conducts the operations, with a standing repo, or repurchase, operation one possibility. However, Gerson said there are some issues with that option that could push the central bank away from it.

&gt;The Fed is now temporarily providing cash in exchange for safe assets like Treasurys and agency debt to keep its benchmark interest rate within a target range of 1.75% to 2%. During the repo market troubles last week, the fed funds rate broke its former barrier of 2% to 2.25%.

&gt;In its more permanent effort to rebuild reserves, the Fed is likely to purchase $35 billion to $40 billion a month in short-term Treasury bills, plus about $15 billion a month in various maturities “over the next 6 months and beyond,” Gerson wrote.

personalfinance,How to ask for a raise in a smaller company with hourly wages?,"I've been at this company for about 10 months now and I'm getting $10 per hour. When I was hired, they discussed starting me at 10 and then giving me a raise later on but didn't specify when. Since then, I've gone from being super new to learning the ropes and training new people some, so I feel like I've definitely improved and deserve a raise as a result. I'm also going to be starting therapy soon but am already financially stretched thin, so a raise would be really helpful. However, I'm not sure how to go about starting/having that conversation. The company I work for isn't a large, super professional one; even calling it a company feels inaccurate. It would feel weird to switch from cracking jokes with my boss to suddenly pulling them aside for a very formal conversation about a raise. With the tips and advice I've read, it feels like talks about raises are very much standing up for yourself and making sure you don't get taken advantage of, basically like a you against them, almost adversarial type thing, and it feels weird to approach it in that way. At the same time, if I do nothing, I wouldn't be surprised if my boss is the type to not ever give a raise unless you bring it up, like doing the thing where they want you to stand up for yourself as a way of preparing you for ""the real world"" or something.

Even if/when I finally muster up the courage to have that conversation, and figure out what kind of tone to have about the whole thing, I have no idea how much to ask for. I don't know if asking for $12 an hour is too much or too little, and with the (honestly sometimes unprofessional) work culture I can't help but feel like if I ask for too much, it'll affect how my boss sees and treats me. At the same time, we're very busy and understaffed, and I think it's safe to say they can't afford to fire me. I also have no idea how much my coworkers make and asking them about it seems a bit rude, and everyone's been there much longer than me so I'm not sure how much help learning their salaries would be.

Anyone have any tips for discussing a raise in a smaller company with a more casual boss/employee relationship, as well as figuring out how big of a raise to ask for?",finance

Essentially rest of world has stopped buying T bonds which forced domestic banks to buy them all and now they have far less reserves and far more collateral. And this isnt going to improve any time soon as US deficits will only increase with aging population.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Salary negotiation advice!,"I recently got a verbal offer from a huge software company for an engineering position. I'm super excited about it and can't wait to get the house keeping done so I can start working there! I want to make sure I'm doing this right so I needed some advice.   
Here's where I F'ed up: When I first got news that I got the offer, my recruiter asked me what my salary expectations were. I was so excited, but also overwhelmed that *I actually got the job* that I feel like I underplayed myself in fear of losing the offer. I currently make $118k (in the Bay Area). I told them ""Something in the $118k - $121k, since that's where I currently fall"". Now you don't have to tell me that this is a mistake, I know I shot myself in the foot by telling them my actual salary. However, I'm hoping to recover from this since this was before I even knew which team I would join (here, team matching happens after the approval). Now that I'm done with the team match, I have a phone call with my recruiter tomorrow morning to discuss my final compensation before they roll out the official offer letter. I wanted to get advice on some things I could say/ask to get closer to what I want.   


About me:

* Graduated college last year (May 2018), started at current company October 2018.
* Experience: I have about a year's worth of experience so far. But the new role I'm going for will be very different from what I do now, so I won't be carrying over any special skillset with me to act as leverage.
* International student who got lucky and got the H1B lottery (!!). The new company is willing to sponsor me, but they may use this as a reason to not budge.
* Living in the Bay area (rent + utilities = $1800) - May not be relevant information but thought I'd throw this out there anyway

My current job:

* Base salary: $118k (Started at $110k - got a bump when I got my title assignment last month)
* Benefits: **Unlimited PTO (!!!)**

New job:

* Salary to be negotiated, already gave range of $118k - $121k.
* Glassdoor tells me that a new grad makes between $100k to $127k(!?!?!), and the average is $118.5k 
   * I don't know how much truth is there in that $127k number, but at least that gives me some confidence that this negotiation might go in my favor. 
* Benefits: 15 days of PTO for the first year :( Add 5 days every 4-5 years. Unlimited sick time off ^(but I'm a bad liar.) 
   * All of this is company policy so it can't really be negotiated. All other benefits are exactly the same, if not better, than my current job.

What I want: 

* This job. While researching I came across ""walking away is also an option"" - but I'm not happy with my current job and I do want to switch. If they say no to everything, I'm willing to settle for what I'm currently getting.
* On the other, more optimistic hand, anything between $119.5k and $120k sounds both reasonable and favorable to me.

Things I may say:

* I know I initially said that I'm comfortable in the so-and-so range, but since talking to the teams and understanding the type of work I'll be doing, I think the $119.5k - $121k sounds more comfortable to me.
* Since I will be going from unlimited PTO to limited, I'd like my new compensation to reflect that accordingly.
* I worked very hard for the interview because I was so excited for the opportunity! Is there a signing bonus included in this package?  


What do you guys think? Are my expectations fair or am I being too optimistic? Is the way I'm posing questions too...greedy? Am I missing something? Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Should I Refinance to 20 year mortgage?,"My mortgage company contacted me to see if I was interested in refinancing.  I bought my condo in May 2017 and am the only one on the title and live alone.  I put about 3% down when I bought the place for $210k.  The condo is just outside of Washington, DC. The property value has probably gone up according to the value of surrounding properties - and I've put some work into the place - fixing some minor things and replacing the windows and patio door.  I haven't had it appraised since I bought it, so I am not sure what the actual value is.  I have about $191k left on the loan.  

My current interest rate is 4.625%. I pay around $1322 per month including PMI, escrow for taxes and condo insurance.  If I refinance to a 20 year, I can have an interest rate of 3.75% and a monthly payment of $1432.   

I am making more money than I was when I bought the place, so $110 more per month wouldn't be too tough to swing.  Also, I have no plans on moving in the near future and I have a stable long term job with good security.  The thought of paying down my mortgage more aggressively is appealing.

I am inclined to refinance but am hesitant because the closing costs will be around $8200.  Which pushes my mortgage balance back up to around $200k. It seems like a good choice in the long run since I'll save around $53k in interest over the course of the loan.  Also, I'll get to 80% LTV a few years sooner so I can get rid of my PMI.  It's just that I would be spending $8200 - even though it isn't coming out of pocket I don't want to make that decision lightly. The loan officer has been very upfront about everything, but I am still wary since it is in his best interest to get me to sign a new loan.

How can I check if this is a good deal? I don't really understand how the housing market fluctuates - is there any wisdom in waiting to see if the rate will drop? I am curious if there are any resources I should check or anything I have not considered.",finance
personalfinance,"File Ch. 7 in Florida? Or work towards paying down debt? Options, suggestions, please?","I have about $23,000 in unsecured debt. - Store CC’s, some medical, an old TMobile debt, and a bank note that does not affect my mortgage. I am in Florida. My mortgage is current with a low fixed interest rate and decent equity.  I have no outstanding student loans. I have no other major assets/property that could be claimed. The debts are now about 4 years old, they are in collections and I have not put payments on credit cards or taken on any loans in over 4 years.

I was informed by a lawyer that in the state of Florida my home is protected and that I could reaffirm my promissory note at the end of Filing Ch. 7 in order to reestablish credit building. 

The lawyer presented this as a fairly painless, approx. 4 month process that would lift the stress of creditors coming after me or taking me to court- which one firm has begun that process. It would also stop the incurring of fees or interest should I continue to struggle periodically.

I am actively working toward and amending my behaviors when it comes to finances because I do not want to put myself or my family in this situation again.

I also understand that should I feel a moral obligation to repay these debts that I can do so at any time. I am open to this idea because I did create the debt.

My partner is a full time premed student and will be on a fixed/very low income for some years to come. I have a 6 year old and generally take on the most time-requiring and financial responsibilities. His father then splits the basic expenses with me at the end of the month- nothing extra.

I will soon have a car paid for in cash that will be in my father’s name and I will begin repaying him for the car as well. 

Can anyone provide experience or feedback on the option of structured payment plans for resolving debt or filing for Chapter 7?

personalfinance,"Closed on our old home, check in hand for new home. Put 100% check towards house or use to pay off debt?","So my wife and I sold our home and close in the next few days. Were supposed to receive a check from the buyers for about 210k after existing loans and fees are taken out. Our new home is about 360k. We initially planned to put all of the 210k towards the new home, build equity fast, and use a VA loan to finance the rest but we have debt that were considering putting the deposit money towards. 

As it sits, we have: 90k in student loans between the two of us (average interest rate is 6% give or take 2 percent), wife still owes 16k on her car (3.9% interest), and about 10k in credit card debt (which we intend on paying off by December) and would still need to take out a minimum of 150k for the new house. Combined income for the house is 150k.

My question is: should we put ALL of the 210k towards the house and build equity? Or eliminate some of our debt (I was eyeing student loans) as I expect to get a relatively low interest rate on the VA loan which would kind of alleviate us of some of the mental burden knowing we only have to worry about the house and nothing else?

My logic is since all of our student loans/credit card will be above the interest rate of the VA loan and total debt will be the same at the end of the day, I'd rather eliminate the higher interest debt and pay lower interest on everything. I did research though and they were saying student loans is ""good debt"" and interest paid can be written off at the end of the year which would kind of negate the interest issue. In addition to that, I'm on an income-based repayment plan which has actually been extremely fair and whatever is left of my loans would be forgiven after 20 years (which would be 15 more years; at least that's how I interpret it). 

My concern is I feel like I may be really oversimplifying this. Is there something else I'm missing that should be taken into consideration? What would you guys do?",finance

personalfinance,Bank of America - won’t put more than $3k in fraudulent charges back in my account after three months,"A warning to anyone thinking about using any Bank of America services.

I finally had to file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which oversees companies such as Bank of America. I suggest you do the same if you’re having problems with BoA’s Customer Non-Service. https://www.consumerfinance.gov/

I’m also taking to social media (starting with Bank of America’s own Facebook page as well as Reddit and twitter) to voice my complaint.


I contacted Bank of America on 7/2/2019 regarding several large charges that hit my checking account from a company called blueorange. The charges were for $1,899.99, 1,299.99, (both hit my account on 6/28/2019) 199.99 and 129.99 (both hit my account on 7/1). There were also several “International Translation Fees” that hit my account in the amount of $57, $39, $6 and $3.90.

This is a total of $3,635.86 stolen from my account. 

I called in to Bank of America on 7/2 after discovering my account balance was off so much and discovering the charges. I was informed someone had my bank check/debit card information and that’s where the charges were coming from. Bank of America immediately closed my card and issued a new one and opened a dispute/claim on the charges from blueorange. For some reason they broke the charges into three separate claims, one for the $1,899.99 charge (claim #190628504171), one for the $1,299.99 charge (claim #190628504292), and one that combined the two charges for $199.99 and $129.99 (claim #190702508226).

Since this was obviously a lot of money for me to be missing out of my account, I wanted to know when it would be returned to my account. I was told by the representative that she broke the charges into three claims to make it more likely that they would put the money back into my account while the claim was researched. Then I was told the larger amounts wouldn’t be put in my account, but the two smaller chargers would. This was very upsetting to me because it was the beginning of the month and I had bills to pay.

I also mentioned during the call that I had been a victim of identity theft where whoever had just about all my personal information imaginable filed a federal income tax return in my name for two consecutive years, applied for boat, car and payday loans, and even tried to open numerous checking accounts in my name. This was of little interest to the Bank of America representative. 

I google searched this blueorange that hit me with all these charges, and found out it’s a scam bank out of Latvia that is notorious for not only scamming  people out of money but money laundering. 

On 7/9 I noticed in Bank of America’s online message center that the claims were resolved and would not be paid. I was very upset and called in to Bank of America. I asked how this could be? I was told that Bank of America claimed they contacted me and that I approved the charges in question, which was ludicrous. I said so to the representative. At first I was told I received a call, which I didn’t. Then I was told I didn’t receive a call but I received a text approving the charges. I told them this was just not correct, that they kept changing their story and it seemed like they just didn’t want to reimburse my account for these fraudulent charges.

The Bank of America representative said he would note the account that I wasn’t contacted nor did I approve these charges and the claims would be reopened and escalated for a quick resolution.

I also went into my local branch in mid-July to speak to a manager and let her know everything that happened up to that point and she did absolutely nothing. It was a waste of an hour with her on hold calling the same fraud department regurgitating the same story they had already given me. 

I called into Bank of America’s fraud department several times between mid-July and mid-September for an update wondering why it was taking so long for this to be resolved and the money to be put back in my account. Each time I was told it could take until the last week of September or so based on the 45 days, or 60 days (I was told both) it can take to resolve fraudulent charge claims.

Finally on 9/25/19 I still hadn’t heard anything from Bank of America. I called in and was told that they were past the 45 days it should have taken and the person I spoke to was going to make sure there was a resolution in the next day or two.

I logged in on 9/26/19 and once again all three claims said “resolved” and “unable to pay.”

I was very upset.


It appears Bank of America didn’t even do any real research like this because when I called in to Bank of America’s fraud department on 9/27/19 to find out why they didn’t pay these fraudulent claims on my account, I spoke with Susie in Arkansas and she once again told me all the notes said is that Bank of America claims to have contacted me on 6/27/19 and that I validated the charges, which is crazy. I looked back on my history and I see no calls, no messages or anything from Bank of America on 6/27.

I let Susie know all that had transpired and she was shocked that Bank of America had, and I quote (I also have a recording of this call) “Had not been an advocate for its customer but instead had been more of an adversary.” Susie seemed genuinely concerned (the first person at Bank of America I had talked to that actually did seem concerned about what happened to me) and said “It seems to me like someone here just swept this under the rug and didn’t want to deal with it.” She also saw the same thing I did about this blueorange apparently being some kind of foreign scam bank or company. I also requested documentation of the research Bank of America actually did on these claims be sent to me.

Susie wrote everything we talked about as well as her opinions on how I (as a customer) as well as the disputes/claims had been treated so far during this nightmare and reopened the claims. She wrote down what we had talked about and entered them in the claim notes and said she was sending this to an upper manager who should read it on 9/30/19 or 10/1/19. I also let her know I would probably be filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because I see no other recourse at this time.

I would like this resolved and the funds that were fraudulently taken from my account put back immediately.

I believe this entire situation reflects very poorly on Bank of America and how it treats its customers. I also wanted to warn anyone thinking of banking at Bank of America to think twice about that decision.",finance

personalfinance,Advice on Handling a Windfall Optimally,"I am in the US and living pretty well. In my household we both make decent money and live with our means. The only negative mark on my finances is that roughly 2 years ago a combination of job loss and medical bills put me in a situation where I had to default on a credit card and have roughly 3000 in collections. Subsequent medical bills have made it not within reason to pay off but in the time since we have avoided more debt, come to the end of medical concerns, kept up with rent and student loans, and paid off our vehicles. We have also built up savings. 

In the coming weeks I am set to inherit fifteen thousand dollars. The documentation provided from the attorney and my own research says this should not effect my tax return. I am also not in one of the 6 states with an inheritance tax and there are no assets that would fall under capital gains tax. 

My plan is to put the money in a savings account at my credit union that has a solid interest rate. What I am mainly curious about it if there are additional concerns for receiving this money. Fees or taxes I am not aware of? Is there a better way to utilize this money than a savings account? Also how can I go about removing this collections from my credit report?

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayments - Use Graduated to Pay the Least Amount of Interest?,"I just want to make sure I am planning my student loan repayments out correctly. I have a mix of both Stafford and Grad Plus loans (\~18% Grad Plus).

On a 10 year standard plan, my total monthly payment is \~$2100. I can afford to pay this, and hopefully a little bit extra. However, it appears that they divide up both Stafford and Grad Plus loans evenly over 10 years, so I cannot ""pay down"" Grad Plus first even though they are at higher interest rates unless I pay extra. 

I noticed that if you pay more than what your standard monthly payment is, it will go towards interest and then towards the highest interest loan.

So am I thinking correctly that if I switch to the Graduated 25 year plan, which reduces my monthly to \~$970, and then pay the remaining $1130 (that I would have been paying on the standard plan) as ""extra,"" that I can now pay my grad plus loans down first and reduce my total interest burden? I understand I would have to stay disciplined in paying that extra amount each month for this to work.

I've read a few posts that seem to confirm my line of thinking but I want to be 100% sure I'm not overlooking something and making a dumb decision before I do this.

investing,Class action lawsuit claims retirement fund paying between 0.11% and 0.14% expense ratios is unreasonable and should be closer to 0.015%.,"From the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/penny-pinching-funds-are-going-to-get-even-cheaper-11569596372?mod=hp_lead_pos10)

&gt; So says a class-action lawsuit filed this month against H-E-B LP, which alleges that the San Antonio-based company has been overpaying for index funds in its employees’ retirement plan. Annual expenses on some of those market-matching funds run between 0.11% and 0.14%—but should instead be as low as 0.015%, the lawsuit argues.

&gt; It’s starting to look as if any fee you don’t need a microscope to see may be too big to last. The suit against H-E-B is among the newest of several recent cases to contend that merely cheap isn’t good enough for retirement investors. And it’s the latest sign that the cost of investment management is on its way [to zero](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-doubles-down-on-free-fund-strategy-1536787062?mod=article_inline).

...

&gt; How low should the fees on retirement funds be? In 2018, says the Investment Company Institute, a trade group for the asset-management industry, 401(k) investors paid an average of 0.41% in annual expenses on stock funds and 0.34% on bond funds.

&gt; By that standard, H-E-B’s index-fund expenses between 0.11% to 0.14% seem like a bargain. But costs have fallen so far in recent years that those low-sounding fees are up to seven times higher than essentially identical funds charge, the suit alleges.

&gt; Fees in 401(k) and other federally regulated retirement plans must be reasonable—although the law doesn’t define what that means. In deciding such cases, “the courts have not said ‘the cheapest option is the only thing that’s reasonable,’” says David Levine, a principal at the Groom Law Group in Washington, D.C., who advises retirement-plan sponsors. Several other factors, such as the quality of service and the possibility of superior investing results, can justify fees above rock-bottom.",finance

**BOTH** have 13 sick days and 11 holidays

Here are the differences

**Federal:**

41k 1st year

51k 2nd year

62k 3rd year 

75k 4th year depending on how i do the first 3 years before stabilizing to roughly 5% a year

Salary increases are automatic with no effort needed other than competently doing my job.

**PTO**

13 days first 3 years

20 after 3 years and 

26 after 15 years along along with 5% matching 401k. 


**City**

In the city job I'll get 

61k first year

5% step system up to a max of 5 steps (years) **(automatic)**

Can apply for internal promotions which if successful will net you the tier and step that would equal at least a 10% pay increase. **(merit based)**

**PTO** are 

10 for first 5 years, 

15 after 5 years

20 after 15 years and no 401k matching. 

Health/dental/vision are too similar to call they are better than the other in some ways and worse in others, so I'll call it essentially a wash, for my particular circumstances, the federal coverage is slightly more favorable.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 30th, 2019.

# **The third quarter was a dud for stocks, but the fourth quarter could be full of surprises  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/fourth-quarter-could-hold-plenty-of-surprises-for-markets.html)**
*****
&gt; The third quarter wraps up in the week ahead with stocks just slightly higher for the period, after a summer of zigzag moves.
*****
&gt; The market faces some of the same challenges in the final quarter of the year, including Brexit, the trade war with China, sluggishness in the global economy and the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. By mid-quarter, the U.S. presidential election will be just a year away, and it could become a factor that could start to trigger market volatility.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 1%, finishing at 2,961.
*****
&gt; For the year to date, the S&amp;P 500 is up 18.1%, but in the third quarter, so far, it added just 0.7%. The S&amp;P started the quarter at 2,752, went as high as 3,028 before falling back. It has chopped in a range down to about 2,860, and has repeatedly struggled to get back to its high.
*****
&gt; “We think you stay within the range — 2,820 to 3,030,” said Julian Emanuel, BTIG head equities and derivatives strategist. Emanuel’s year-end target has been 3,000.
*****
&gt; “We see new highs, whether they happen in the fourth quarter or in 2020, as a function of geopolitical developments. From our point of view, the developments of the last several weeks, particularly [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren rising in the polls, increases in our mind the probability you get some sort of deal with China,” he said.
*****
&gt; Analysts said there could be more volatility because of the efforts by House Democrats to impeach Trump. The investigation into the president has to do with his withholding of aid to Ukraine and whether it was tied to a request to get dirt on front running Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
*****
&gt; Warren, D-Mass., whose tax and other policies are viewed as unfriendly to markets, is catching up with Biden in the polls, and some strategists see her benefiting from any negative news on Hunter Biden’s dealings with a Ukraine gas company. Emanuel said if Warren continues to gain, that may encourage China to move forward with a trade deal with Trump, for fear making a deal with Warren would be more difficult.
*****
&gt; Besides political headlines, there is some key data coming out in the week ahead, including Friday’s September employment report, and ISM and PMI manufacturing data on Tuesday. The economy is expected to have added 145,000 jobs, above the 130,000 last month, while the unemployment rate is expected to stay steady at 3.7%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; “We expect another month of census-related hiring to push public sector payrolls higher and, as a result, we forecast only 120k increase in private sector payrolls,” notes Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. “Our forecast for private sector employment gains in September would represent some improvement relative to August, but our forecast overall remains consistent with our outlook for slower employment growth on the heels of deceleration in economic activity.”
*****
&gt; There are also a number of Fed speakers scheduled for next week, including New York Fed President John Williams; Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren.
*****
&gt; Trade will remain a major topic for markets, as U.S. and Chinese negotiators get closer to Oct. 10 talks. Headlines Friday that the White House is considering blocking or limiting U.S. investments into China sent stocks lower, after optimism about the talks lifted them early in the day.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the fourth quarter may have a different tone from that of the third quarter, after the wild move lower in rates during August and early September. He expects bond yields have bottomed, and he favors some of the cyclical names, like financials and energy.
*****
&gt; “The likelihood is long-term yields move higher, and you could see some form of switching out of bond exposure and into stock exposure. That type of embracing of the stock market is typical of final innings,” for markets, he said.
*****
&gt; Strategists said the impeachment efforts against Trump may ultimately not have a negative impact on stocks. Even if he is impeached by the House, the Senate would be expected to acquit him. Analysts liken the possible reaction to be more like when President Bill Clinton was impeached and acquitted by the Senate than when President Richard Nixon was facing impeachment proceedings. Nixon resigned before he was impeached.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained 28% in the year after impeachment efforts began against Clinton, but lost 39% in the year after they were begun against Nixon.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the 2020 presidential election could also come into play this quarter, and Trump may take actions to boost the economy, such as finding a solution to the trade war with China. A resolution could give a boost to stocks.
*****
&gt; “People are very nervous and in general reasonably well-hedged because they remember the fourth quarter of last year so well, and from our point of view, we don’t necessarily see this trading range resolve itself any time soon,” said Emanuel.
*****
&gt; Markets will also be watching the Fed’s repo operation Monday. The Fed has been conducting open market operations to assure there is enough cash in the short-term funding market, which was under stress at the start of last week. The Fed has calmed the market, but market pros are watching to see how much activity there is and whether rates rise. The final day of the month typically sees a surge in cash requirements, and on Monday, investors may require cash for the settlement of $113 billion in Treasury securities.

# October’s First Trading Day Mixed Over Last 21 years

&gt; Based upon data in the soon to be available Stock Trader’s Almanac for 2020 on page 88, the first trading day of October is DJIA’s fourth weakest of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA points gained. June, August and September have been weaker. S&amp;P 500 has been down 10 of the last 21 years on the first trading day of October. DJIA’s record is slightly softer with 11 declines and NASDAQ’s performance has been the worst of the group, down 12 times with an average loss of 0.36%.

# Fruitful to Sell Rosh Hashanah

&gt; Happy Jewish New Year to you all! I took the above picture of pomegranates last year in Tel Aviv’s Carmel Market during my adventure through Israel with my family in celebration of my eldest son’s bar mitzvah.

&gt; As the High Holidays approach you may remember the old saying on the Street, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur.” It gets tossed around every autumn when the “high holidays” are on the minds of traders as many of their Jewish colleagues take off to observe the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement.

&gt; The basis for this, “Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur,” pattern is that with many traders and investors busy with religious observance and family, positions are closed out and volume fades creating a buying vacuum. Even in the age of algorithmic, computer, and high frequency trading these seasonal patterns persist as humans still need to turn the machines on and off and feed them money or take it away – and these algorithms and trading programs are written by people so the human influence is still there.

&gt; Holiday seasonality around official market holidays is something we pay close attention to (page 88 Stock Trader’s Almanac). Actual stats on the most observed Hebrew holidays have been compiled in the table here. We present the data back to 1971 and when the holiday falls on a weekend the prior market close is used. It’s no coincidence that Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur fall in September and/or October, two dangerous and sometimes opportune months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/64f4f19e19c5f8d9bb768316134c46af/9ac6dde39074b5e0-62/s640x960/be7a91356b29ad1cdc61cb6e117a0a05e2127cd3.jpg))**

&gt; Perhaps it’s Talmudic wisdom but, selling stocks before the eight-day span of the high holidays has avoided many declines, especially during uncertain times. While being long Yom Kippur to Passover has produced 59% more advances, half as many losses and average gains of 7.0%.

&gt; This year the high holidays commence on Sunday eve, September 29, and end October 9 with Yom Kippur right in time for Octoberphobia. The current news flow already has folks selling ahead of the Jewish High Holidays, setting up the market for further declines in notoriously volatile October.

# What If September Is Up?

&gt; Well, when the worst month of the year is up, it’s not so bad. October is slightly better when September is up. But Q4 and the rest of the year are generally more positive. In the tables below September is ranked by largest gain for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and NASDAQ since 1971. Q4 remains about average, but full year gains are above average. So if September can eke out a gain then watch out for Octoberphobia, but fear not the full year.

# Financials Hold on to Broad Gains in September

&gt; In spite of the relative weakness we have seen in equities over the last week, US stocks are still poised to finish off September and the entirety of Q3 in the black. While overall breadth among industries was more positive several days ago, there are still four sectors where every industry is still in the black on a month to date basis. As shown in the graphic below, all of the industries within the Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities sectors remain in the black for the month of September. To be fair, Energy and Real Estate each only have two industries in their respective sectors, so for these two sectors, it isn't quite as impressive. Within the Financials sector, though, all five are still up on the month while all three industries in the Utilities sector are also up MTD.

&gt; In the Energy sector, even with this month's gains of over 4%, both industries in the sector are poised to finish Q3 with a decline. Utilities have been big winners so far this quarter, but Electric Utilities have been the clear leader with an eye-popping gain of 10.2% this quarter.

# Looking for Action? S&amp;P 1500 Most Volatile Stocks

&gt; For traders with a short-term time horizon who are looking for big moves, we have updated our list of the S&amp;P 1500 stocks trading above $10 that have the largest intraday high-low ranges (based on the average percent spread between the intraday high and low over the last 50 days). The stocks are grouped based on whether they have a rising or falling 50-day moving average (DMA).

&gt; While the VIX remains relatively low, in recent months we have started to see some big moves in individual stocks and that can be seen in the fact that a number of stocks in the table below currently have average intraday ranges of more than 5%. The most volatile stock in the S&amp;P 1500 is Lennox International (LII), which has had an average intraday high-low range of 9.5% over the last 50 trading days. Granted, it's only an $11 stock, so the 9.5% average range works out to just about a dollar per day, but it is still volatile nonetheless. Behind LII, there are another three stocks with average daily moves of over 8%, but here again, they are all relatively low priced stocks trading at less than $20 per share. The highest-priced stock on the current list is Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR). With a share price of $91 and an average daily move of over 5%, IIPR typically sees an intraday swing of over $5. That's a trader's dream if you trade it right, but a nightmare if you get it wrong!

&gt; In terms of sector representation on this month's list, Consumer Discretionary is the most prevalent with 17 different stocks. Behind Discretionary, the next closest sector is Energy at eleven. Finally, with regards to the breakdown between stocks with rising and falling moving averages, there are modestly more stocks with falling moving averages (29) than rising moving averages (21), suggesting some underlying weakness even with the broader S&amp;P 500 trading not far from new highs.

# Manufacturing: Doing Okay or In Collapse? It Depends Who You Ask.

&gt; Last night in The Closer, we discussed the huge divergence between regional Fed manufacturing activity indices and the ISM Manufacturing Index. In the chart below, we've created a proxy for the ISM Manufacturing Index by averaging sub-indices from various regional Fed manufacturing surveys. The result is generally well-correlated to ISM, but over the last few months the two have diverged wildly. While the Five Fed indices from the New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond Fed districts would indicate an ISM reading in the mid-50s, the actual readings have been deteriorating dramatically. Of course, these three Fed districts are a relatively small snapshot of the overall national economy, but collectively their sample size is similar to the ISM's. It's hard to say which is ""right"", but the huge divergence is certainly noteworthy.

personalfinance,Inherited money - how to use it?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I've recently come to inherit quite a sum of money (\~150k Euro) that has shown up on my bank account recently. I'm now in the luxurious position to decide what would be best to do with the money. About myself: I'm (30M) currently finishing a PhD in physics and may or may not stay in academia after finishing. It's unclear whether I will have to move to a new town for the next step.

So far, I've been considering a number of options on what to do and what conditions came along with it:

\- **Real estate**: I live in a large city in Germany where real estate is already on the rise, but I could still afford to buy one or - by taking a loan - two nice flats in decent areas. **Limitations** here would be: I don't want to be one of those landlords pushing the rent to the maximum possible. Purchasing prices are \~3.500€/m^(2), the rent prices are about 9€/m^(2). Obviously, this depends a bit on flat in question. Also, if you sell a flat within 10 years after purchase, German law will impose heavy taxes on such transactions to penaltize real estate speculations. Also, as written above, I don't know where I will be in 10 years from now.

\-  **Financial investment** : I've also considered bringing my money to a bank to have it parked in investment funds, ETFs or whatever. I'm not sure what interest rates would be reasonable to expect. **Limitations**: I would like to invest my money steering clear of investing in companies that are doing military/fossile fuel/food speculations. If this reduces interest rates a little, fine for me.

\- **Stock market**: No idea. I would like to park the money somewhere where it more or less takes care of itself without too much supervision.

Thanks in advance for any advice, tipps or warnings :)

personalfinance,"Starting my life from scratch, I need all the advice I can get.","For various reasons (most of them sad so let's not get into too many details) I haven't been able to lead a normal life and do normal and necessary things towards independence. It got to a point that I am now 24 years old in Lisbon with absolutely no money and nothing to my name, and completely fed up with my current state, so I am sacrificing everything to break out of a terrible vicious cycle now that an opportunity for change has presented itself.

Currently, my family and I are moving (more liked getting kicked) out of my childhood home and I am taking the chance to completely start over and have just my bare necessities so I don't get sidetracked. I'm planning on finishing high school and getting what is essentially my first job by 2021 (I managed a door-to-door sale job across the country for nearly 3 weeks straight from 9am-11pm in 2015 but never got paid, I was desperate and took the plunge and it really fucked me up for a while in home life and job-wise especially since it basically doesn't count whenever I bring it up as work experience during job interviews). This means my living situation is going to become completely unbearable within the year because in my household, self-improvement is a threat to those in charge and leaving would mean instant homelessness for me (and no, I can't stay with friends or extended family, that is strictly off limits unfortunately). I can handle that as long as what I am doing does bring SOME fruition and a way out of my living problems.

My family is incredibly controlling and always kept my brothers and I constantly in the dark about anything remotely serious and adult. I was never taught taxes or finances or basic living skills, but over the years I've picked up some stuff in secret with friends, like cooking and budgeting, but nothing like legalities and that scares the shit out of me. I know anything FIRE or whatever is beyond the realms of possibility for me at this point, but I just need to know what it is that I can do to help me in the process of becoming a functional member of society because I really do not want to get into deep shit when I'm giving up so much just to get on my feet. I'm really trying to make an effort just to choose life at this point.

I have no idea where to start, but I know I need certain things to aim for for the following years. So far I know that I will absolutely need (in no specific order (I think? I'm open to suggestions)):

- Updated documentation
- Health (glasses and whatnot)
- Driver's license
- Some kind of finance person to help me with taxes and managing money.
- A mode of transport (I'm thinking a city pass to start out and a moped or something way further down the line, I really need to be able to get around here to succeed at getting a job)

For all intents and purposes, I know I will need at least 5k in order to complete this list alone and not cutting corners. With my lack of experience and diploma, I'm lucky if I can find a job that pays more than 400€/month until next summer if I manage to graduate, and maybe only slightly more money after that. Is there anything I can do to help stretch this?

I know I need to learn to invest but I have no idea how to start or even if I should yet. I'm seriously so fucked. Hell, I bet this is probably even the wrong subreddit. I just need SOME guidance, anything would really help.",finance

investing,Shorting Deutsche Bank,"Hi,

I am thinking about shorting this stock throughout October to hedge my mostly-US-equity portfolio and to try and make a profit.

Pro:

1. The company proved that they have big problems. Their return on equity is -4.67%, they mostly have a negative net income, valuation is at -120.29B EUR and the share price has been constantly going down for the last 10 years (from yahoo finance:  [https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DBK.DE/key-statistics?p=DBK.DE](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/DBK.DE/key-statistics?p=DBK.DE) ). Talent retention (especially after recent layoffs) is a problem. They are reportedly inefficient and rely on outdated technology. I also keep hearing about their huge derivatives portfolio portrayed in a negative light, but I don't know much about that. The interest rates are negative and the growth is slowing down so I have no clue how they plan on making money if they couldn't so far.
2. The overall market sentiment is bad as you know so I think October will be horrible and financials like this one will be hit. In October we have trade talks, Brexit, maybe more impeachment news, US-EU tariffs and psychology ( [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/octobereffect.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/octobereffect.asp) ).

Con:

1. If Brownian motion of stocks is assumed and the stocks have the natural tendency to go up, then I am expected to lose money and if I win, it will be through luck.

Please let me know your thoughts. I am still researching the company and will make the decision in the following days.

I’ll try to keep this short: I’m a full time college student who recently separated from the military. I’m currently going to school and being fully supported through my GI bill, meaning all tuition is paid and, with proper budgeting, living expenses too. I applied for financial aid and was quite surprised to see that my state offered me quite a large amount of aid in the form of federal and state grants, ranging into the thousands of dollars. Since my tuition is already paid by the VA, those grants then get refunded to my bank account in full each semester. My question is “where do I go from here?” 

I have a decent sized emergency fund and have taken care of all of my obligations and needs for the next few years until graduation. I have absolutely no debt and my tuition is fully paid for by the VA. I already have a good head-start on retirement savings in the form of a 401K. The only events I have on my immediate horizon are a proposal within the next year and planning for a family after college (3+years from now.)

I have 7 student loans, totaling $19,674. The grace period will be ending 11/10/2019. I have already paid off the unpaid interest on it so that it doesn’t capitalize once the grace period ends. Here are the loans. My highest interest rate is 5.05%:

1. $1,039 3.76%
2. $1,505 5.05%
3. $2,000 4.45%
4. $3,485 3.76%
5. $3,500 4.29%
6. $3,645 5.05%
7. $4,500 4.45%

I make $50k/yr before taxes with a bonus in June and December. I have already made a 5 year plan to pay these off which will consist of minimum payments on every loan with a portion of extra money at the end of each month going towards the loan with the highest interest to make this actually shorter than a 5 year plan. I bring home $3,188 after taxes and 401k each month. After all responsible and irresponsible expenses and saving, I usually have about $800-1000 left over. I am planning on putting ~$300-$450 of the “leftover money” towards the highest interest loan as an extra payment at the end of each month. 

Once my grace period ends, I am in a position where I can drop $2,544 as a one time payment to kickstart this thing. My question is, is it smarter to use that $2,544 to knock out the two smallest loans which have a 3.76% and 5.05% interest rate OR do I knock out one for $1,505 with 5.05% interest rate and then put the remainder into the other loan with the 5.05% interest rate which would end up taking $1k off of it?",finance

Bitcoin,"BTC, a response to the Cartel and the necessity of DeFi","Finding my legs in the Crypto sphere has been a wild ride to say the least. Watching BTC in particular drive up to its ATH was incredibly exciting for an anarcho-capitalist like me. I am not ""allowed"" to judge people as to why they are interested or invested in crypto, it is also an exercise in futility because in my opinion anybody invested/interested in BTC/Crypto are my allies. Allies in a fight against the central banks of the world - and the cartel.

Call me paranoid, but I have seen what the central banks are capable of. For me it began in 2008 or so when I saw the govt. and politics doing things that were against my interests. Upon investigation I learned what the FED was and seemingly what their agenda was. A really great animated short presents their 100+ years of existence and history before the FED was created, which can allow the observer/investor/enlightened a more macro perspective into why *I* think BTC and Cryptocurrencies were created. The video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/yzxvAR2KTR8).

Two dimensionally we can see that the banking cartel are clearly not created for our best interest. I assert the banking cartel were created to control the money supply thereby limiting ""peasant's"" access to real assets in this world - controlling our lives, treating us like cattle. What crop are they harvesting? Our life force, our souls, our ability to create wealth. Do not sell humans short for an instant. We are capable of incredible feats, however, leashed like a broken horse we are now tools for the masters to reap financial benefits of **our** work/labor/intelligence/beauty/etc. The banking system, the diamond cartel in Africa, the enforcement through the military industrial complex are all a part of **The Cartel**.

The Cartel is extremely developed and they have another language for how they speak about world events. What we hear in this world is not the world as they know it. In the words of George Carlin:

&gt;It's a big club, and you ain't in it.

You will never be in it, and you better be damn sure they will kill people to ensure that they keep the club open. That is what the military industrial complex does *for* the cartel. Try to think of the cartel as a hydra. One head tends to political enforcement and squelches dissent (look at what is happening in Hong Kong), another head tends to financial enforcement not allowing the people to build wealth (see the FED).  The more wealth people have- the more power people have, and the less they do; and they can't have that. The more power we as a population have, the less the enforcers have, and a next logical step forward would be prosecution of these corrupted heads of enforcement.

Now, after listening to market sentiment lately I hear a lot of people stressed about the recent dip in price. I think psychologically we are meant to feel this way by design. There is a great [article](https://medium.com/@super.crypto1/4th-dimension-bitcoin-manipulation-cartel-can-it-be-burnt-no-way-c53de65c166a) that goes a little more in depth about crypto market manipulation and the CME, however, the main takeaway I found was this quote:

&gt;As price keeps dropping people start despising the asset. See what happened to Gold and Silver since 2011. The more it dropped the more people hated it. Many Gold bugs sold precious metals at the bottom and switched over to Bitcoin and Crypto (when it was at the top.) This exactly what “they” want the retail investor to do as “they” collect more of it at the lower prices.

Psychologically speaking, the financial industry as it is designed circa 1913-2008 has been a slow and steady blood letting of the population. They may stick only one needle and tube into your body but over a lifetime they will harvest an incredible amount of ""energy"" (money, resources, life-force) from just one individual .. also include trans-generational population control.

This is why bitcoin was created.

It was to free the people from this highly tuned machine that is consuming the souls of everybody you know. The sheer amount of on-chain data available and still being realized about the crypto markets (as now studied by Willy Woo and [others](https://cointelegraph.com/news/glassnode-co-founder-says-on-chain-data-can-spot-bitcoins-tops-and-bottoms))  is likely tantamount to the data credit card companies are privy to. The cartel has generations of data with which to study and strategize their next enforcement campaign. We in the still very immature age of DeFi are only JUST discovering what we don't know.

We barely know: what we don't know..

This is why people are afraid of BTC/Crypto right now. This is why trolls and enemies and the unenlightened try to psychologically kill BTC/Crypto in the mind - it is a literal programming. It is a big machine and you and I are a cog, they are the driver. The beauty is, we have an instrument to finally break out of this prison of the soul. There will only ever be 21 million BTC, and after that value appreciates via the stock-to-flow ratio, that value will expand and follow paths of least resistance likely into a full fledged developed DeFi infrastructure - as the plan is laid out now. How and when we get there depends on many factors, but the most important concept for the people right now are faith, reassurance, and hard work.

Faith behind the idea of Crypto, reassurance that BTC/Crypto is not dead, and hard work behind the technology that will enforce a free world of tomorrow decoupled from the cartel and their toxic system that sucks the soul out of people.

I am excited about Pax Gold and even the possibility of staking the coin on a wallet earning compound interest. We are nearing a new age of banking/finance where the micro percents skimmed off the top are yours to keep. Every time I think of a social security number I think of a bar-code and ledger accounting for all the wealth the elites have harvested from a single person. I would assert people in 2019 create virtually $1,000,000 or more of value through out their lifetime (adjusted for inflation of course, trollol) that is recycled into the system via the matrix of financial control and enforcement.

personalfinance,Student Loan Payoff Strategy - Large Monthly Payments vs. Smaller Payments and Smart Investments?,"I've got $27,000 remaining in student loans that I want to pay off in the next year. The interest rate is 5.88% and at this point my payments are pretty much all going to the principal.  I could just pay $2,300 a month over the next 12 months and pay off the full amount that way.  But I'm wondering if there is a smarter way to go about it.  I'm thinking something along the lines of making regular monthly payments that are less than $2,300 (maybe somewhere around $900 - $1,300) and then investing the remainder (something between $1,000 - $1,400) in some way.  Then down the line making a larger lump payoff on the remaining loan balance. 

Does anyone have any ideas or insights? Has anyone taken a similar strategy of making regular payments but also investing to build a lump payoff? It just seems like maybe there's an opportunity to make some of that money work for me.",finance

personalfinance,Linking two personal bank accounts to one shared one.,"Hi,

I just got engaged a while ago and as part of the process of moving towards marriage my fiancee and I were starting to join some finances to save for goals.

We both have personal Chase accounts and set up a joint checking and savings with Discover bank.

Just got off the phone with Chase and apparently only one of their customers can link to an external account. It denies her when she tries to link them although the external account has us both on the title.

The Chase rep was sure this couldn't be overridden. It's baffling to me. I'm sure it's some anti money-laundering thing but really, there's NO way to send money to another account from two Chase accounts?

I did some Googling on the topic, trying to see if this was some federal law or something...didn't find much.

How do I go about this? One way I can see is to leave Chase and then only one of us will be using it. Don't like Chase anyway, wouldn't mind leaving. Otherwise it puts us in a bad spot because we simply can't both contribute like we planned.

personalfinance,"Should I lend myself money from my personal savings, in exchange for interest?","Since 2 years, I have been strictly putting aside money for early retirement. Most of my savings are invested in the stock market, the rest is cash. I do not intend to touch the money before I retire. I am currently doing a traineeship, therefore my salary is not the greatest. Due to the limited amount of money available, I sometimes rely on my family to help my out.

I need 200$ for some repairs on my car, so I have to pay back 22$ for 10 months.

personalfinance,Worth refinancing college loans to save about 1% APR with impact on credit report?,"I have been getting regular offers from Navient( who currently has my loans) and SoFi for refinance opportunities. I am fortunate enough that I don't have a ton of student loan debt (right around $20k) and it is at a fairly low 4.5% APR. However, I am wondering if the savings would offset the slight drop on my credit from the hard pull and the new account. Presumably if I re-fi'd with Navient, it would not be a new account but maybe someone could say whether that is the case for sure. The math is looking like:

|SoFi|3.49|201.42|23844.41|118|

personalfinance,24yo wondering if I'm doing OK with my $,"Hey all!

I've been browsing through this subreddit and have been taking a lot in. So much great info! One thing I don't fully understand yet is how I am doing personally with my finances. I thought I'd post a little about my situation and see what others think (anonymously of course!)

Basics:
24 years old,
Electrical Engineer,
Salary: $68k,
Debt: none,
Credit cards: 1,
Credit Score: 800,
Savings: $30k

About me:
Live in rural area, don't go out much,
Have a girlfriend, she is fairly frugal,
I LOVE cars (I fully own 2 right now, about $30k total value),
I don't buy expensive clothes, food, electronics, etc.,
Treat myself every once in a while, nothing too crazy.,
I have 1 Bitcoin from when I was younger and thought it was cool technology. Still holding onto it.

Monthly Budget:
Rent small appt.: $1k,
Auto Habit: $200,
Auto Insurance: $120,
Gas: $200,
Groceries: $200,
Restaurants: $100,
Entertainment: $50,
Misc: $100,
Clothing: $25,
Other Hobbies: $30

Sum: $2025/month

I put in 8% to my 401k, my employer matches that 100% for a total of 16% per month to retirement savings.

Right now, I have most of the $30k savings in a money market account at my bank just to get a slightly higher interest rate. 0.95% APY

Future plans: I'm planning to get married and buy a house in the next 2-3 years. Girlfriend is a teacher and makes about $35k/year. 

I'd like to get into some investing to use my money a little more. I know I can do better than the money market rates... My 401k is through Fidelity, I'm thinking about opening another account and looking into some mutual funds. Any tips?

If anyone took the time to read through this, I'd love to hear some feedback on how I am doing, if you have any tips, or if I should make any major changes to my overall plan.

Bitcoin,The thing that blows my mind about bitcoin that we should know (but not necessarily everyone else yet),"Bitcoin has dropped over 80% THREE times before this recent “crash”. Parenthesis around the “crash” because is 80% really considered a crash anymore to Bitcoin? 

An 80% decrease in other assets would really strike panic in at least US domestic markets if not global markets. Historical crashes are:
1) The Great Depression of the 1930’s hit a total of 86% percent down. 
2) The 60’s to the 80’s saw around a 70% stock market crash. 
3) The Dot Com Bubble of the 90’s saw a 40% crash. 
4) The Sub Prime Mortgage Loan Crisis of 2008 saw a 50% crash.... 

Bitcoin has seen 80% “crashes”. This is Bitcoin’s fourth rodeo. I’m not sure what other stock (let alone, asset) can withstand 80% “crashes” and come back stronger. The first alternative asset I think of is the AMZN stock which fell 70%~ during the Dot-Com bubble. AMZN fell from $85~ to I roughly $20. Now each AMZN stock is worth roughly $1,725. Amazon did this once.

Bitcoin has done this three times before. This is an anomaly of an asset. 

Pairing the A) economic circumstances and social normalization of the word “recession” in 2019, while the B) political environment is looking quite hectic. “Revolutions” are happening in Venezuela, Iran, Hong Kong, India/Bangladesh, multiple African countries... and do we dare forget that C) the federal reserve, not just the US Government, is facing troubling circumstances with BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). Russia and China already bypassing the US Dollar taxes in trading with other countries like Iran. 

It is quite a blessing to be involved in a wonderful asset like Bitcoin as early as 2019. After tried and tested “crashes”, the entirety of Bitcoin does not collapse like any other stock would. This is not a stock. This is the emergence of a new asset class. That keeps on going and going and going.",cryptocurrency

After a rough transition into my career, I managed to stay on track and even get a little bit ahead of my goal timeline. 
My minimum loan payment every month is something like $110, but I have been consistently paying $500/mo for a while now—targeting the higher interest rate loans as much as possible. 
Here’s the problem. About 4 months ago, I started getting a “payment past due” notice on my student loan payment portal. Every time I saw this alert, I immediately clicked it and made a payment which I assumed was taking care on the problem. Fast forward to about a week ago and I get a notice that said my account status was delinquent for having loan payment late BY 120 DAYS. I frantically called my loan provider to see what the problem was and learned that though I was making payments toward every loan every month, I had not been paying enough on my lower interest rate loans (I then learned those are the loans I that make up my minimum payment every month). I paid off the overdue balance right away, but I checked my credit score and it has dropped over 100 points because of this mistake.

personalfinance,Weird question about finance.,"So, I have had a weird idea to motivate myself to pay off my student loans quickly ie: faster then the normal schedule.

I have some student loans, and I'm paying off the one with the highest interest payment first so that I can save the most in interest fees (highest interest rate + highest principal). So the weird part of the question is, is there a way that I can tell, mathematically, just how much a dollar paid to my principle will save me? Like. ""Oh, this dollar spent here would SAVE me like....10 cents in the future, or this ten dollars spent here would save me 50 cents etc etc?""

I mean, on top of ridding me of the stress that comes from the debt itself, on top of the interest saved.

personalfinance,Father passed away with no beneficiaries on 401k,"My father recently passed away and my sister and I are his only children.

My sister and I were hoping he had set us up as 50/50 beneficiaries to his 401k so we could leverage an Inherited IRA, but the plan administrator only had a contingency for spouses/domestic partners in the event of no beneficiaries. As a result, his 401k is going to his estate and will be subject to the estate income tax rate, which for federal is 37% for amounts over $12,000. Then there’s a 5.7% tax rate for state (VA). And of course, it also goes to probate, for another 1%.

With a 401k balance of nearly $400,000, we'll be left with only $177,000 by the time the tax man has taken his cut.

**My question at this point, is there anything we can do to lower the taxable amount of the 401k being disbursed to the estate? Is there any rollover or tax deferred accounts (my sister is planning to open 529 accounts for her kids) that can be used to lower this income or are we essentially screwed?** I can find a million and one articles about how you can lower your taxable income for an estate *before* you pass away, but nothing about how to do that *after* you’re deceased.

NOTE: My sister and I have engaged a CPA to help with the tax returns for my father. We’ve also reached out to my father’s employer to see if there is any documentation that might show him selecting beneficiaries at any time. He worked for the same company for over 30 years and they’ve changed 401k companies several times (Mass Mutual, Vanguard, TRowe, etc) and don’t know if the beneficiaries might’ve gotten lost somewhere in the fold. It's a hail mary at this point.

P.S. Let this serve as a reminder to everyone to please select and update your beneficiaries! Had my dad survived his heart attack he probably would’ve had another one had he known how much of his retirement would go to the government.

EDIT: I wanted to provide a quick screenshot of the 2019 Tax Rate Schedule for Estates, which can be found in the 1041-ES form. This is where the ""37% for amounts over $12,000"" comes from. It is marginal, so it's technically $3,075.50 + 37%, but I simplified things for posting purposes:
https://imgur.com/tXMQ6vJ

The 1041-ES form is the form estates file with the IRS for income generated by the estate. Generally speaking all of my dad's other assets such as his checking, savings, etc... were all post-tax so most of that doesn't counts towards the estate's ""income"", except for some paltry interest, but because his 401k is all pre-tax, it counts as income.

EDIT 2: If it helps, my father was retired, but not taking any distributions from his 401k yet. He was almost 67, so he wasn't forced to take any RMDs yet.",finance

personalfinance,New Job Without a 401k,"Two part question, one personal and one philosophical. Hope this is the right place.

I've got an opportunity to move over to a new position at more-or-less a startup from my current position as a federal government employee. I'm in the highest bracket of government schedule pay so I don't have a ton of room to grow, and this new opportunity is offering a great salary package and some equity that has the potential to be fairly lucrative, risk of startup aside.  Outside of that risk factor that's difficult to quantify, i'm trying to look at what my loss in real terms will be of government benefits - the 401k in particular.

So color me stupid for not ever realizing there are some drastic differences in tax deferred account types between 401k and IRA. I had always just assumed whether you had a 401k with match or an IRA you started on your little ol' lonesome, you could contribute the same tax deferred (the 19,000ish figure). So two main questions here:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Assuming I'm all in on managing my own retirement accounts, given my AGI will be over the 122k limit for single Roth eligibility, the only real option I have for tax deferred accounts is a traditional IRA with the $5,500 contribution limit? If that's the case, I not only have to take into account what I'm losing from employer contributions here, but also what the delta in taxes is going to be for that extra 13,000 or so I contribute up to the max when i'm determining my loss in real terms from the move?
2. Philosophically -- what the heck gives? Why would the government give tax benefits to a plan offered by an employer (401k) but not make those same write off options available for people who don't work for someone who offers a 401k? Do companies utilizing a 401k pay the government a fee somehow or something that offsets those tax losses that I'm not seeing?",finance

investing,"Is this situations when ""Tax loss harvesting"" is almost a no-brainier?","A Person lives in Albany, NY, with salary of 110k. His Marginal Tax Rate are:  24% (federal),  6.57% (state) and  7.65% (FICA). Total 38.22%. He has invested his money: 50% in stocks, 50% in simple saving account. He keeps his stock investment with no intention of selling. He's producing an income from dividends and Saving account's interests. All his dividends are qualified, so he will be taxed ""long term"" on them. Saving's interests are obviously taxed ""short term"". 

In calendar year, all he'll earn is:

1. His salary
2. $500 from dividends (taxed as ""long term"")
3. $1000 from saving account's interests (taxed as ""short term"")

Now, here's the situation... sometime in the middle of the year, he wants to pickup new stocks. His intention is to hold, but suddenly, the price of newly bought stock fall and he's down by $1000. Is this a perfect situation to sell and buy similar stock? (Let's assume for the purpose of that example that he's **100% sure**, it's not ""wash-sale rule"").

Second question, can you generalize, that if you're in the situation described above and have short term losses you should keep realizing them? Let's assume you have alternative stocks that doesn't trigger ""wash-sale rule"". I'm asking because I understand that *""tax loss harvesting is a process of deferring taxes until a future date"".* But if I will sell that alternative stock with ""long term"" gains (eventually, in the future) - that is a benefit, because this year I'm not paying 38% taxes on them.

personalfinance,Risk and Debt / Invest or Pay?,"Hi PF,

I thought I might type something up regarding **loans, debt, and investing and why to pay what debt vs saving money** because there are **so many** questions about debts and whether people should pay them off or not.  


So I'm going to divide this topic into a few parts: **Risk Tolerance**, **Debt Significance**, and **Investing Vs Paying**.  Skip around to where you feel it useful. Also, this is a super low level like basics, so understand, it's not for PF experts, it's more of a primer for newbies. 

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Risk Tolerance**


This is actually the easy part.  I am a **risk adverse** individual.  I know my tolerance for losing money is very little.  When there is a market downturn I have to know where every penny of my money is going. I can't stand throwing away my money on bad investments.


An example of my low risk tolerance actually drives certain decisions, like the decision to own a home in an area where housing prices are escalating.  


I do have a higher tolerance however if I understand the risks better and mitigate the results. 


I hated looking at stock blends and seeing some large cap value company I owned had shares of sears or other companies I knew were going in the toilet and I freaked out, pulled my portfolio and did my own financial research and invest in a blend of stocks similar but without the sure failures like sears and with a higher dividend production, as those stocks tend to be more stable over time. I also don't day trade, all my trades are predicated on making gains over months, or years and ignoring daily fluctuations. 


An example of a high risk tolerance individuals are Gamblers, Sports Bettors, people who enjoy the general concept of roulette or craps..  A classic example might be the difference between James Holzhauer and Ken Jennings of Jeopardy. James and Ken Jennings are probably equally knowledgeable on trivia.  James was so successful because his risk tolerance was high enough to take huge swings and bet big on questions that he had extra time to consider and answer.  Ken's bets were probably half the size of James' but by tackling the high value questions first and dominating hole categories rather than sniffing out daily doubles Ken was able to have longevity and success with less risk.  It's funny because James didn't lose for losing one of his famously large wagers, he lost because someone sniffed out the daily doubles first. 


So overall, no comment on whether high risk is good or bad.  Simply know yourself and act accordingly. 


___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Debt Significance**


So now we get to debt types and which debt to pay first. This is going to depend on various situations.  In most situations not headed for bankruptcy, your highest debt % is what you want to pay first, and you simply follow that rule.  Secured or unsecured, you don't want to pay anyone for the money you are borrowing, and if you have to borrow money, or make use of consumer protective tools like cash back and fraud protection, you want to pay very little for that. 


*Payday loans* are usually the highest % interest you'll ever get and compound sometimes as often as daily. This is because it's **unsecured debt**, and specifically it's debt issued carte blanche as cash, you could literally spend it on cocaine in the next ten minutes and the payday loan company can't stop you, thus it has the highest % of interest attached to it and is a highly risky activity for the lender.  The riskier the loan the MORE you pay for it.  Other types of unsecured debt are medical, credit card, and in store financing (typically actually a store credit card now a days.)


**Secured debt** is debt that is usually tied to something you posses, this is why it's secured debt.  You can get terrific rates on homes because when you default the bank can go through the process to acquire and then sell the home.  The debt is less risky for the bank.  Other secured debt is secured via legal methods of control, things like child support and student loans fill this category.  While it's secured by legal methods, this is one of the worst types of debt for a person to have because you can't typically can't get rid of this debt, and in most cases any delay in paying this debt will make it bigger. 


___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


**Investing Vs. Paying**


So now we get to balance our equation.  On one side of things you can take the significance of the debt and the interest % and weigh it against the other side which is possible growth opportunity in the market, or savings account etc...


At a very basic level there's a few things you can do with your money that we will term investments.  

1) HYSA, this keeps most your money liquid and will give you somewhere between 1.5%-2.5% interest annually with smaller gains compounding monthly.  This is a newer offer that is all the rage for your emergency fund monies. Generally these HYSA outpace most bond rates.  So **HYSA = 2% return**. 


2) Investment.  Stocks, mutual funds, ETF's. Putting the money in the market is a higher risk higher reward effort.  The average return of the S&amp;P is used as a stable measure of general stock performance.  A good mutual fund will cover somewhere close to 7% per year.  A 'generally' higher risk concept is to invest the money yourself in individual stocks.  this can be higher and lower than the average return of the market, but generally still higher than a HYSA.  

Investing is not without risk though.  While the S&amp;P returned 19% in 2017 it also did -6% in 2018.  And market timing strategies while sometimes extremely successful can also be infinitely more risky. So we will call this category **MF = 7%** because on average that's what you can expect. 

For the purposes of this explanation we are not going to single out property in any way, it will be more useful to use property in context of paying debt, so for this, we are going to assume everyone already has a mortgage. 


3) Paying debt. You don't get a 'return' on this money, but what you do get is lack of negative interest.  if it costs you 4% annually to borrow $1000 you're going to pay $40 for that if you hold that debt for a year. by paying that $1000 off in January you don't get to invest that money but you also don't lose $40 extra dollars. 


Combine where you feel comfortable. In general you want to pay your highest % debt off first, at least that's what we favor here, because financially that makes the most sense and saves you the most money.  Some people are very strong advocates of taking stock market gains over paying lower debts.  For high risk tolerance individuals if you can make 20% money on a thing for a cost of 4-7% of that money in debt, it makes sense.   However, for someone like myself who is extremely risk adverse I don't feel comfortable carrying debt over 2% for a long time and will pay anything that I can't earn guaranteed returns on right away. 


So understand your risk tolerance, and apply it.  I would say for a risk adverse individual any Debt you can eliminate that is greater than 3.5% is worthwhile in the scheme of investing vs carrying debt.  For a higher risk tolerant individual I might raise that threshold to 5% or 6% ALL of personal finance will tell you, at 6% if you can eliminate a debt for a guarantee of 6% vs the risk of a return, then you probably should. But again PF is personal, people with a high risk tolerance might take out a loan at 5-6% and play the market for something they believed in...  I would not.  But this is just a primer to help guide decisions, I'm not here to take away your choices. 

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

As a note, if you are going into bankruptcy, or any kind of financially bleak hardship try not to take on unsecured debt and make sure to pay Secured Debt items like student loans, homeowners dues, and child support.  It's tough, but in the long run it will help credit recover faster and lighten your financial burdens later.
