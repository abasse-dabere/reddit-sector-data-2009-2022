personalfinance,FHA Streamline Loan,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I would like some advice on whether it'd be beneficial to refinance my fixed 30yr FHA loan through the FHA Streamline loan program. My current loan is 105k at 5% interest and 6.345% APR with a 0% interest 7.5k FHA down-payment assistance loan. At what interest rate and how long would I have to live in the home for the FHA Streamline loan refinance to be beneficial?",finance

I keep on putting in these numbers, and they just don't add up.

Edit: For clarity, this portion is for the federal taxes. Line 3 in the software is defaulting to 0 for the form 8889.

Edit2: Fixed! I'll leave this here for anyone in the future who has something similar. Don't just click through like I did! There is a part where it does state was the person covered all throughout the year, and that will make it 3450 if you had coverage for the year 2018. Thanks to everyone who helped!

I have run my taxes with FreetaxUSA, CreditKarma, and Turbotax and they give me the same result. I personally like FreetaxUSA the best from a user interface standpoint though CreditKarma had nicer graphics.

personalfinance,Do I need to report State refund as income even though I paid it back?,"Long story short: Didn't get a 1099c from a credit company that forgave a portion of my debt in 2017 but it got reported, so I got bills from Federal and State adjusting my tax forms and paid both, including my entire state refund back with interest.

Zipping through Turbo Tax for 2018, it's still saying I got $245 back in 2017 from the state to report as income on Federal, but in reality, I didn't get anything. I didn't think to amend 2017 since both bills showed how the IRS changed my return. I'm assuming what I'm seeing now is just old info as saved with Turbo Tax pulling from the return I originally made out last year.

Should I leave the $245 as income for 2018 or zero it out since I paid it back? I assume the IRS has extensive records of what I paid, but I don't want to goof it up again.",finance

personalfinance,Tax Calculation Concern,"I have a question regarding a simple tax calculation I am receiving from TurboxTax and I was hoping anyone is able to explain my concern regarding this matter. 

I have attached a picture of SAMPLE Calculation using random wages, and random federal/state withholding. 
I used their online calculator using the following link: https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/calculators/taxcaster/ 

Screenshot url : https://ibb.co/7CjXJqx

In my example, I have $20,000 in wages with $1,500 federal withholding and $200 state withholding. Filing as single person with the standard deduction of $12,000, it comes to be $8,000 as taxable income. Using 2018's tax bracket, 10% is taxed from $8,000 which comes to be $800 owed. As a result, With the $1,500 federal withholding and the $800 owed, the person should receive a refund of exactly $700. 

Here is my concern. Using turbotax's online calculator it comes to $697 which is $3 short. Therefore, if I'm not mistaken, the calculation is off by a few dollars. I'm not a tax expert and I'm just a student learning about taxes. Maybe I'm wrong and perform a miscalculation. Please let me know if I'm the one that is not doing it correctly.

If it is off by $3, can anyone explain why is this happening using their software? I know it is not much, but I feel like they need to be done exactly correct.

Age 20.


02/01/2019: Debt to income ratio.

Current Bills: 

Car $368

Wifi $85

Car Insurance $236

Credit Card $125

Electric $120-$300(new rating at .6) (I based it at $150)

Animals $15

Food $100+?

Gas $45? More?

Phone $35 (optional)

Taxes (Not Included) $5624 Annually (ouch)

Current Essentials To Live: $1,124  (How can I get this lower?)

Trade in or refinance car? Buy a used with cash? Potentially saves $368p/m.

Pay off credit cards. Saves $125p/m

Use less Electric? (or hope NRG saves my ass)

Negotiate WiFi Bill? Can I get them to go cheaper? Or downgrade my plan?(shit plan anyway) May save $20p/m

If I can do all that saves $513 if possible monthly expenses =$611 (half of what it was before)

Downside to any of this?

Car might have horrible gas mpg = More money on gas + $40 Car might breakdown if shit.

Only downside.

Current Income

Job $1400

Rent $500

Total $1900p/m Debt to Income = $776 Extra. $1289 Extra With Lower.

What can I do to get more income?

Get a 2nd job P/T + $400?

Get a better job? +unknown.

Invest?

I currently own a house worth $235,000 (Free and Clear) (yay?)

Roth IRA?

Stocks?

401k?

Any other option im missing?

Home Equity out of my house? Invest it?

Downside to any of this?

2nd job: Time How many hours am I willing to work? (before i go crazy?) (and I have pets)

Better Job? Full unknowns but possibly higher income. More hours? Or less hours? More pay? Less pay? Need something reliable.

Home Equity, Potential Investment Fails, Then I’m stuck with a Mortgage.

Upsides?

Better Job: Find a job with better pay, = More income? More hours? Benefits?

Second Job: More Income, I can Invest for financial security.

Home Equity. ( Gonna Give this its own topic)

I have $235,000 Available. With LTV Potentially $199,750 Available to me. 

Lets ideally look at taking $140,000 out. What can i do with it?

( First things first, house needs repairs, I will cover this later but its roughly $15k)

I can take $110,000. Invest it into 2 or 3 properties for multi-Family homes.

In turn I will be paying 35% down with roughly a $100k - 110k mortgage (expenses go up) (income goes up)

Let's get a bit into the numbers of all this going on…

Getting a Home Equity with Roughly a 4.5% interest rate? I Would be paying $800p/m 

Buying At Least 2 Multi-Family Homes I would Increase Income by $3000. Decrease by $1250?

Would give me a extra $900p/m with success. With failure. -$2050p/m

Lotta Risk, Little Reward.


What Can I do to ensure that i succeed?

I can enroll the homes into HUD, get guaranteed Rent (and any damages fixed)

Ideas?


Current Debts   Credit Score 608 (lowered due to high balances) (was 716)

Credit Cards: $3,000

Car $12,000

That's all.


What can I do to make things easier?

Take advantage of Government Assist programs

Snap?

Medicaid

Foodbanks

Current Resources:

$3,200+150?

Taxes? (did a large file expecting $20,000)

Pay off car? Or trade in and get cheaper?

Pay House Taxes $5600

Pay Off Credit Cards $3000

personalfinance,Should I pay student loans now or later?,"Cross posted with some modifications to /r/studentloans ... thought r/personalfinance may have additional insights:

I have a bachelor’s and a master’s degree with a total of about 35k in federal, unsubsidized student loans.

I work full time in government service. I expect to stay with my job for the next decade or so at least. I’m also now going to law school part-time. 

When I finish law school, I’ll have a total student loan debt of about 111k.

I plan to use public service loan forgiveness and hope the program will continue.

My student loans are all federal unsubsidized Stafford and grad plus loans. They are deferred because I am in school half-time.

How can I maximize the PSFL program? Should I get my loans out of deferment and start paying them now, as I go, or should I continue to defer all current and future loans until I graduate?

I am also wondering if I should instead pay extra on the mortgage/car loan before tackling student loans at all.

What seems like the easiest/smartest option is: transfer all of my funds to my NFCU account using Wells online transfer, leaving 2k in my Wells account to avoid a fee for having below 1.5k and the 500$ as cushion for emergency/so I can use my debit card while waiting for a card from NFCU. Reason being, I want to wait til the end of next month to make sure I don't miss any recurring payments I have linked to the Wells account. 

Once February passes and my direct deposit arrives in my NFCU on March 1st (I get paid monthly), I'll go into Wells and ask for a check for the remaining balance to deposit online to NFCU and close my Wells checking/savings accounts.

Am I missing anything important, or does this seem like a solid plan of action? If anyone has a smarter/better way I would love to hear it. Maybe I'm just over-thinking things, who knows.

personalfinance,Changed jobs mid-year; now I owe back money from my healthcare.gov plan,"For the last several years, I’ve been self employed and fairly low income. In 2018, I was on a marketplace health plan (very high deductible, lowest payment option available, received no services while holding this plan). In May, I accepted a full time position which offered healthcare, so I cancelled my marketplace plan. I was only enrolled during the months I was fully self employed. In total, I made less than $40,000 in 2018. I am single with no dependents. 

Now that I’m preparing my taxes, I see that I owe a significant amount of money since my annual income is higher than it would have been had I continued as an independent contractor. Before entering the info for this plan I would have received a federal refund around $300, and now I owe around $800. Even though I made very little during the months I had the plan, the credit is calculated using my total annual income. When I ended my plan, the representative I spoke with made it sound like that wouldn’t be the case. Apparently I misunderstood. 

Is there anything I can do to fix this or am I stuck paying for enrolling in a plan required by law that I could not even afford at the time? I enrolled to avoid paying a penalty, and now I’m being penalized a huge amount anyways.

personalfinance,How can I continue to invest in the US stock markets as an expat?,"I am an American expat living abroad and would like to get serious about investing.

I created a Fidelity rollover account which I am rolling my previous US jobs 401ks into and I also plan on opening an investment account with them so I can have everything in one place. I plan on investing in Fidelity funds, perhaps other ETFs, MFs, and some individual stocks. 

My question is, is the only way to continue to invest in the US to constantly send money from Japan to the USA? Each time, I will be paying a fee and losing on the exchange rate. Since the dollar is on average stronger than the yen (currently 92c per 100 yen), I'll be losing quite a bit anywhere from 8%-12% each time I send money back.

I do know the economy is supposedly entering into a recession or slowdown soon in the US, but the markets reacted very nicely to the fed news that a rate hike is far off. Other tech earnings news has caused gains elsewhere and I feel like I'm missing out. 

Is it worth it to send money back monthly to invest? Is there a way that I don't know about that I could be doing? Is investing in Asian markets the only possible way? I can do that but I'd like to do that later and in any case I'd like exposure to the US markets.

Banking,be vigilant when disputing a fraud charge - my BMO Harris Bank story,"I have used BMO Harris Bank for years. I opened my first account as a joint account when I was 16 and they were a local bank under a different name. That bank was bought out, I’ve long since switched to my own checking account, and I’ve had the absolute worst experience with a fraudulent charge.

I got paid on 1/18. On 1/19 I attempted to order pizza, only to have my card declined. I called the bank to see what was up. Online banking was down that weekend for a scheduled update so I knew I had to call. My account was flagged for fraud. I still had $53 dollars in my account (I should have had over $400), but because they noticed the fraud, they changed my account to credits only. I was not told this, instead I was told I would be able to withdraw funds via ATM with my pin. I wanted to grab that last $50 so I at leas had some cash while I got this sorted. I’m a paycheck to paycheck girl while going to school and trying to pay off my car.

I went to the ATM the next morning with no luck. Call the bank back and this new lady tells me that I can’t withdraw the funds and that I need to visit a branch as soon as possible to get the fraud dispute started (I was also told this on the previous call). She also informed me that this charge was from PeoplePay, which I had never heard of and had to have her explain to me over the phone.

Tuesday morning (1/22, bank was closed 1/21 for a holiday) I walked into the branch I have been going to since the day I opened my account. There were no available personal bankers and they asked me to come back at noon. When I came back at noon, I sat with a personal banker who walked me through what I would have to do, and she told me the fraud occurred through my online banking. A fraud claim needed to be filed and I needed to start the process of getting back into my online banking. I began to backtrack and realized I got an email saying my account was locked on 1/18 from failed login attempts. She said that’s probably whoever did this. She also informed me that I had to open an entirely new checking account because the old one would never be valid again. And I needed $25 to do so. Also the investigation would be 7-10 business days before I see that money again. 

At this point I have no money. Payments that I set up over the weekend ‘processed’ but would eventually be returned because I had no funds. That meant the $50 I hoped to take out that weekend were lost to me for now. The banker also had to call online banking to figure out the process I needed to go through. I told her I could get the $25 to open an account, but it wouldn’t be until later that day (borrowed it from my brother), and she said I should come back later. 

I went in for the third time that day. She told me she had filed the fraud claim and we opened my new checking account. She also told me my credit card payment would process (that lady $50) and it wouldn’t be returned, but my cell phone payment would be. 

In 1/19, I checked my credit card app only to see that $50 payment had actually been returned. I called the bank since it was Saturday and branches were all closed after noon to verify I had funds in the locked account. I did, but he was unable to transfer them over because it had to be done in person since there had been previous fraudulent activity.

On 1/28 I called the banker at the branch to transfer that money into my good account (she said since she knew me I didn’t need to come in) and check the status of the fraud claim. I was told in order to restore 
my access to online banking, they required a third party to wipe clean my devices I used for online banking in case any one was hacking them.

Being without any money, my only option was to drive an hour to the apple store who would wipe my phone and computer for free. But before I drove that distance, I decided to swing by the ATM to make sure she had actually transferred the money over. She had not. I went into the branch and made sure she did it, triple checked my account, and drove to the apple store. Also it was snowing and the roads were super dangerous, but because of my work schedule, that was the only day I could go.

On 1/29, I went into the branch with my receipts from the apple store to restore my online banking. The girl I had been previously working with was not available, so I worked with a different personal banker. I sat at his desk for 45 minutes while he was on hold with online banking to restore my account. Eventually that got done and online banking informed him that a male had called on 1/15 asking to reset my password. Apparently whoever this was had my SSN. I asked if they had a number of the person that called but never got a response. I asked him if he could check the status of my fraud claim. He said sure, but he didn’t want me to have to wait there while he was on hold. He assured me he would call me later that afternoon with an update. I never got a call.

Yesterday, 1/31 (the 7th business day), I called the original banker I was working with for an update. When she returned my call, she said there was an issue with the claim and I needed to contact online banking and fraud myself. She gave me the general customer service line. I called and got to a human who told me they would transfer me to online banking and it would be a 45 minute wait. I asked to speak to a manager. His manager told me she would contact one of the managers in online banking and they would call me back before the end of the day. They did not.

I regularly tweeted about this whole ordeal, and the verified BMO twitter DMd me asking what happened and for my phone number so someone could contact me. Several hours later I got a call from a guy (I believe he was in customer care/social media) who told me he was going to have an investigation started to figure out why I’m getting this run around. 

Around 5:30 pm I got fed up that online banking had not called me as promised earlier, I called the bank again. I was on hold for 20 minutes, told that it would be an additional 15 minute hold time for online banking, and I waited. It was an hour before I got someone in online banking. I was upset. I was in tears by the time they answered and my mom was very angry too as she seen what had happened and had to help me throughout by lending money, 

This lady informed me that there were no fraud claims filed on my account. I would have had to sign something for that to happen and it never did. She didn’t understand why the banker I had been working with in person didn’t file anything and why I’ve had to do all this without a claim. She told me the fraud department was closed now (it was after 6pm) but she gave me her first and last name and we picked a time of 11am today (2/1) that she would call me back and transfer me directly to fraud and I wouldn’t have to be on hold anymore. 

I don’t really expect that call to come in today. I don’t ever expect to get my money back. But I haven’t stopped trying yet. It’s been exhausting and I’ve cried several times. I’ve gone 2 weeks now having to rely on other people for money. I have bills to pay. I had to switch my direct deposit and it wasn’t verified yet so I don’t have my paycheck this week. It will be sent out in the mail, hopefully, so who knows when that will come. 

As soon as I get my paycheck, I’m opening an account at a new bank. I’ll leave what I have a BMO open for a bit just in case there is an automatic payment I forgot to move over, but I’m done with them now. I don’t expect anything good to come from them anymore.

tl;dr Someone fraudulently got into my online banking, took my money. I was told a fraud claim was filed and the investigation was underway. Nearly two weeks later, I find out that claim was never filed. I’ve never had this happen before. I didn’t ask the correct questions. I just trusted what they’ve told me. And it’s not worked out well for me.",finance
gaming,Battlefield 4 PC Ruined by Awful Admins,"This is a serious issue. One of my favorite games of many years that I have put over 500 hours into. A game that I put countless time and effort into. Only to see it be ruined by these awful admins. After playing BF1 and BFV, I wanted to go back to a simpler time and try out Battlefield 4 again. After taking hours to download, because Origin downloads are an absolute joke, I went to the servers to see that there are still a lot of people playing. As examples: 58/64, 63/64, 64/64(1).

&amp;#x200B;

Loaded into multiple servers only to have a few people playing, sometimes no one playing at all... just me. After looking around, people call this ""seeding"". Which is faking the playercount of servers to increase the chances of people playing on them. This is downright wrong, and looks very bad on EA DICE for allowing it. Yeah the game is old news to them, but it is still one of the largest games in the franchise (imo). In 2019, as of writing this post, this issue is NOT present in Battlefield Bad Company 2, 3, Hardline, or BF1. All playercounts are legit. All of the games are dying or near dead, but legit. I understand Battlefield 4 is going to die some day, but at least just let it. These admins shouldn't get away with false advertising playercounts.

&amp;#x200B;

I downloaded the Battlefield Player Count Checker. which is a Chrome Extension. I was actually mad when I saw the results after installing it. The exclamation point next to the playercount means that it is fake, and they are showing the ACTUAL players online in the server.

https://i.redd.it/zz51jtofcyd21.png

This is the second set of servers I found. Once again, all spoofed (or seeded). I should mention that if servers have a green check mark, the playercount is legit. But there aren't many of those. If there are, the servers are legitimately empty.

https://i.redd.it/3h3awhdqbyd21.png

The last picture to conclude my rambling. This one makes me the angriest. These are servers I've played on for the longest time. The servers I've played for years, and have made great squadmates on. I also played on ADK servers a lot, but those were shutdown, along with SOG servers, also shutdown.

https://i.redd.it/zaa4t0mwcyd21.png

Last picture, I promise. This is what spoofed (seeded) servers look like with the battlelog extension off. Absolutely rage inducing.

personalfinance,I just finished filing my taxes for the first time on my own. I think I need clarification?,"Right off the bat I'm sorry if these questions have been asked a ton over the last few days. This was my first year filing taxes myself through turbotax. Last year and this year I filed my taxes as a single person while claiming 1, with just the standard deductions. No student loan debt either years and I simply had one W2 form with health insurance coverage all year for both years. My income in 2017 was $30,957.89 with $3226.87 federal withheld. My state income tax was $2099.46. My 2018 income was $32,589.19 with $2853.42 federal withheld with a state income tax of $2213.54. 

My refunds for 2017 were $674 federal and $283 state, while my 2018 refund is $100 less at $574 federal and $300 state. My question is, is there a single reason that my federal withheld amount went down in 2018 compared to 2017 even though there were no changes in my claims or deductions? Also, would my federal withheld amount dictate why my returns are less this year compared to last year?

Thank you for any and all help!",finance

# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Check your percentages!**  There are two different challenges this month depending on your position in the [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) list of steps.

1. **If you're on steps 0 through 3, do the first challenge.**  That's you if you're:
  - Building an emergency fund
  - Paying down expensive debt (interest rate over 10%)

2. **If you're on steps 4 through 6, do the second challenge.**  That's you if you're:
  - Saving for retirement
  - Investing for other long-term goals

3. **If you're not sure which challenge applies best to you (e.g., not saving for retirement yet, but don't have credit card debt), feel free to pick and choose from either challenge.**

4. **Bonus points: do both challenges!**

# First challenge

Your challenge is to pursue improving your interest rates.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 2 or more of the following things:

* If you have debts, compile information on each debt including the type of debt, the amount owed, and the interest rate. Also [find out your credit score and review your credit report.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=title%3A%2830-day+challenge+get+on+top+of+your+credit%29&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=year)
* If you have credit card debt that you are carrying from month-to-month, [call up your credit card company and make a request to lower your interest rate](https://www.creditkarma.com/credit-cards/i/how-to-lower-credit-card-interest-rate/).
* If you have enough money in your checking account to cover *at least* one month of expenses, start building a second tier to your emergency fund by opening a high interest savings account that pays at least 1% interest rate and deposit $50 or more into it.
* If you already have a savings account, [research your options](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/rates/) and consider moving your savings account to a bank paying a higher rate.  (The wiki has some [common recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions).)

# Second challenge

Your challenge is to audit your investment expenses and emergency fund.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 3 or more of the following things:

* Request a fee schedule/statement from your financial advisor (if you have one).
* Request a fee schedule/statement from the administrator of your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement plan (or find out your fees by logging into your plan account).
* Look through recent statements to see if there are any charges you don't recognize.
* Calculate your [blended expense ratio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Expense_ratios#Blended_expense_ratio).
* Evaluate your emergency fund and adjust it accordingly if your expenses and/or risk tolerance have changed. If you raised it, make a plan to meet your new e-fund goal sometime in the future.

The idea here is that you might uncover some expenses you didn't know you were paying, which in turn might give you a reason to make a change for the better. The impact of [costs on investments can be depressing](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost). If you find a clean slate, sleep well knowing that your money is working for you first and your investment company second. Another way to sleep well is to ensure you have enough set aside for emergencies. You may have set up your emergency fund goal and met it a number of years ago and perhaps times have changed for you. It's a great time to ensure you have an appropriate amount set aside for your expenses and risk tolerance.

More information on investment expenses:

* Specific advice for employer-sponsored plans is in our [401(k) fund selection guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k_funds).

personalfinance,First time home buyer,"Hey all, my fiancé and I are wanting to buy our first home in SC. We both have credit scores right around 730. The house we are looking at is listed at $268990. Our lender is saying if we put 5% down at 30 years he can make it so that we don’t have to pay pmi. However, right now we can’t afford the 5% down. I was looking at 0% down loans through USAA or Navy Federal but I’m not sure if this is a good idea. FHA is also an option but I’ve read mixed things about it. I was hoping y’all could give me some advice and maybe point me in the right direction to get started. Thanks!

Edit:  right now I’m still in school until May. Once I graduate I get a 10% pay raise and then another 10% when I get registered in my profession, which would be probably a month after I graduate. My fiancé would be pulling in around 100k a year after all is said and done

Edit 2: 100k annually not monthly. Sorry",finance

personalfinance,[Retirement] 401(k) Investment Options,"For the past 3 years I have been contributing to a 401(k), choosing by myself what funds to invest in. Now, being 3 years older and wiser, I have realized it's probably not a good idea to expect me to beat the professionals in the market, hence I have decided to invest in a Target Date Fund instead.

Now, my company had a free consultation with a retirement planner who recommended me to invest in a ""Model Portfolio"" instead. He claimed it is more expensive than a Target Date Fund, however, I have full transparency into what I am investing in, and he would expect it to have a higher return.

My consumer senses are tingling telling me he is trying to sell me something I might not want, so I was hoping you guys could tell me if his suggestion is dumb, or if I should actually go ahead with the Model Portfolio.

personalfinance,Traditional IRA contribution to wrong year: what are my options?,"Hi everyone,
Last year I opened a traditional IRA account with $5500. I claimed it on my 2017 return. Looking at it now, I clearly made a mistake and had applied the $5500 to 2018, not 2017. So last  year’s return is wrong. I checked with the IRA holder and they can’t change the year it was applied to. 

I will owe to fed and state ~$1100 total (difference between the refund I got and the refund I would have gotten without the traditional $5500 IRA contribution)

What are my options and likely punishment?
1. Call the IRS? 
2. Use TaxAct (what I used to file last year) to prepare and print an amended return for both federal and state? If I do that, do I write two separate checks for federal and state? Can I include a note begging for forgiveness and showing it’s my first time with traditional IRA and I am fixing my mistake as soon as I discovered it?
3. Other option? 
Thanks a bunch!",finance
personalfinance,Pay Off Student Loan or Pay On Capitalized Interest?,"I've recently consolidated some of my student loans into a single Federal Direct loan due to making too much money to stay on Income-Based Repayment. Nelnet has put all of my loans on forbearance through my April payment cycle until the consolidation process completes... which means all my accrued interest is going to be capitalized. $2,408 total, $1,865 on the consolidated loans.

The consolidated loan will be at ~6.8% interest with an estimated total balance of $28,248 and minimum payment of ~$250. The other four loans total $13,226 with interest rates ranging from 3.4% to 5.6%.

Here's the kicker: I have another loan through ECSI at 5% interest totaling $3,123, minimum monthly payment of $80.

Would it be smarter to pay off the capitalized interest on the Nelnet loans or pay off the ECSI loan to free up that payment to throw at the consolidated loan?

Income info: ~$2,341 monthly after taxes, rent, bills, and essentials. $1,400 tax return coming late Feb./early March. $1,000 savings now. Planning on saving $1,000/mo, paying $1,000/mo on the consolidated loan, minimum on non-consolidated loans.",finance

personalfinance,Filing Multiple W2s,"A little background

I work for the labor union, meaning I can work for multiple companies throughout the year thus receiving multiple W2s. I have filed my own taxes every year while in the union so this is nothing new to me. However, this year I received 3 W2s from the same company I worked. At first glance it makes sense because I signed up to work with the company on 3 different occasions throughout the year. 2 of the 3 were on the same site just at different times of the year and the last 1 was on a completely different project. Now here lies my problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Copy 1 has all the normal boxes filled out as they normally are on a W2. Box 1-Wages, tips Box 2-Federal income tax withheld etc etc. EXCEPT for Box 18 -Local wages, tips, etc. is left completely blank

&amp;#x200B;

Copy 2 and 3 has the state wages/state income tax listed which are the same as the federal in copy 1. They both have the local wages and local income tax listed but they are nowhere near the same. My thought was I can attribute this difference to be that I worked at one location far longer than the other, which in fact I did.

&amp;#x200B;

All 3 copies have different locality names. Also the local wages aren't the same as the federal/state wages with one being only a few hundred dollars compared to thousands on the others. Which again I assumed was the difference in time I worked on said sites.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question is how do I go about filing these? I assumed I should file each one separate seeing as they aren't actually the same, but I feel like they aren't complete cause I've never received one where the first 12 or so boxes are empty. I thought maybe the company just took a shortcut or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated. I prefer to file my own taxes to save on my money. Local places charge an arm and a leg.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

&amp;#x200B;

When using HRBlock's website to file it does not allow me to enter them separate because you aren't allowed to leave certain boxes empty, which as I stated copies 2 and 3 are fairly empty. This leaves me to believe I should just add the local taxes together from all 3 copies and use that total seeing as the federal and state wages are the same on all 3 copies. But I will continue to monitor this post for insight.",finance

**Enter the Federal income tax withheld from your last salary payment:**

personalfinance,Need advice on handling inherited fixed annuities,"Hey r/personalfinance friends. I've inherited a few fixed annuities and unsure how to handle them. I'm looking for some advice. Forgive me if I overexplain some of the details, as I'm really not sure of all the general rules of how annuities work.

My father passed away a couple years ago, and through his life insurance company, I inherited two IRA/fixed annuities from him directly, and one IRA fixed/annuity from him by proxy originally owned by my grandmother. They each have an interest rate of 3% or 3.5% and a total combined balance of about $19k, which in the context of a fixed annuity doesn't seem to be much. I am 30 years old, married, renting, and generally comfortable living on my current income. I have healthy savings and investments, much of it accumulated from my father's passing, so I'm not hurting for that $19k in the annuity.

Each annuity distributes annually by dividing the total accumulated value by a factor based on my remaining life expectancy (53.3 for 2019). Last year, this resulted in a total annual gross distribution of ~$350. Given my current income, this is generally a day's worth of gross pay and feels more like ""Hey, quick reminder that your dad's dead, here's a pittance"" more than anything. To me, the psychological impact of the bombardment by this life insurance company with document upon document all year with only the annual check is irritating at best. The minimal accumulation of value that the annuity will have to be distributed be in such small increments over my lifetime is not something I want to deal with. After dealing with this for a couple years already, I want out. I've taken steps recently to simplify and consolidate my financial life in the past couple years, and this is just a hangnail I'd like to remove.

The cash surrender value of all three annuities is equal to the accumulated value, and the cash surrender charge amount is $0.00, so it looks like there's no penalty from the company and I'll receive the full value. The representative I talked to told me that there should be no penalty for withdrawing before age 59.5 because that should only apply to the previous holder's age (both were older than that), but I'm not sure I believe that... is that true? i'm currently looking to buy my first home with my wife this year, which I've read might get me out of any applicable penalty if I use the funds on a house... if I do have a penalty, is that true?

I'm thinking of a few options... please let me know which one you think best applies to my situation, and please help me understand why. Or, if you have an alternative suggestion, I'd be interested in that as well.


* If no IRS penalty applies, fully surrender all three and invest in a CD/Vanguard High-Yield Tax-Exempt Fund at a roughly equivalent interest rate  
* If an IRS penalty applies, take the full distribution upon closing on a house and roll the full disbursement into my down payment  
* Suck it up and just leave them alone, and take the annual checks

personalfinance,How do people take Vacations when they have debt to pay?,"Just curious how everyone takes vacations when everyone has debt. How do you justify or know you can take one? 

Context for me:
I had $29K in federal student loans when I graduated university (very lucky compared to some). My uncle passed and left my family some money - I was given $8K contingent I put it down on my loans. So I started out with about $21.5k in debt by the time my grace period ended. 

I’ve been making payments on it and only have about $11K remaining and plan to put down another $3k this month.  My tax return is going to be abnormally high (due to the program I’m in and only working 6 months this year) - I will get about $3,500-4K in my return. 

I was going to throw my return on my student loans (they are just under 4% interest and the monthly payments are about $250). But have been thinking of spending it on a trip somewhere.

I have no credit card debt but I did get a new car to replace my 20yr old one when I graduated. I have about $13K left on that ($280/mo payment and 3.29% interest rate)

If I liquidate my Emergency Fund (which isn’t 100% necessary as I have the luxury of my parents being able to bail me out to get back home if something goes wrong) then I should be able to pay off my student loans this month...

Is it justifiable/reasonable to take a vacation?

personalfinance,Question re State Local &amp; Property tax deduction (USA - DC),"Hey All,

&amp;#x200B;

Working through my taxes this year. Just realised I am allowed to claim my property taxes as a deduction (first bought home in December 2016, so relatively new to it). So have a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I do an amended return for 2017 for Federal &amp; DC taxes. 2016 probably wont be worth it, as any property taxes would have been pro-rated and I only owned the property for a couple days that calendar year.

&amp;#x200B;

With the new cap on State &amp; Local taxes, I have encountered an issue that I am not sure how to manage it. 2017 was first year I itemised, as the mortgage interest deduction, when combined with the S&amp;L taxes finally made it worth itemising. 2017 State Withholding on W2 was $7,445 which was claimed. Refund was $1,092 which is being declared in 2018. The withholding this year was $8,048. Property taxes are $2,586. So total taxes are $10,634, being capped at $10,000. So I am losing $634 in deduction, but my State refund is looking to be around $1,000 again. Which will be taxable income next year, even though it was never taxed. How can I fix this or deal with it on my taxes. Its only an issue because the new cap was introduced.

personalfinance,Help understanding 3 combined retirement plans,"Hi All!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to understand the retirement savings plans at the University of Washington: [Benefits pdf here](https://hr.uw.edu/benefits/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/benefits-academic-professional-librarians-staff-20180413.pdf).  It looks like there's fully 3 plans that can all be used at the same time to raise the amount of pre-tax deductions. 

&gt;\- UWRP is a Defined Contribution (DC) Plan under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 403(b).  Up to 7.5% of my gross salary with 100% employer match  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Voluntary Investment Program (VIP), an optional, unmatched retirement savings plan under Section 403(b) of the federal tax code. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's a third option, too, but I first want to understand how these work together.  Here's more info:

 

&gt;If you have both a UW VIP account and a [UWRP account](https://nb.fidelity.com/public/nb/uw/home), which are both 403(b) plans, make sure the combined total of all contributions to both accounts don’t exceed the IRS “annual limits.” In addition to the summary below, see the section “limit on annual additions” and “employee elective salary deferrals” on the IRS page for [contribution limits for 403(b) retirement plans](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-403b-contribution-limits).  
&gt;  
&gt;The current year maximum combined employee and employer annual contribution limit allowed under the IRC 403(b) is:  
• $56,000 for tax year 2019  
&gt;  
&gt;An additional $6,000 is allowed if you are age 50 or above as described in “Catch-up Contributions” section below.  
&gt;  
&gt;The maximum amount of “elective” contributions you can defer to your VIP, is based upon the retirement plan in which you are participating as a UW employee, is as follows:  
&gt;  
&gt;UW Retirement Plan participants:  
&gt;  
&gt;$19,000 – if you are under age 50  
$25,0001,2 – minus your optional 2.5% UWRP contribution amount:

What are the limits?  I want to max out.  My salary would be $110k.  So I'd start with the UWRP and put in $8250, and they would match that dollar for dollar, for another $8250, for a total of $16,500 from me plus employer in the UWRP.  

&amp;#x200B;

For the voluntary part, could I then put in up to $10,750 so that combined with the $8250 that I put into the other plan that came from my salary, I've put in $19000 total, plus the employer's $8250 = $27,250 total?   
 Or am I wrong and there's only ""room"" for another $3500 in the optional ""VIP"" on top of the $16,500 because the grant total is $19,000?  Or, last option: can I add $19,000 of my salary to the VIP on top of the $16,500 from the other plan?  

&amp;#x200B;

Then, there's this:

&gt;\- [Washington State Deferred Compensation Program (WSDCP) is an additional retirement savings program under IRC 457(b)](https://hr.uw.edu/benefits/retirement-plans/optional-retirement-plans/deferred-compensation/)   .UW employees may participate in both VIP and WSDCP in the same tax year at the same time.  

&amp;#x200B;

This one looks more clearcut.  It's just another $19,000 I can take out of my salary, pre-tax.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to guess, I think the grand total of my max pre-tax salary contributions would be $38,000 ($19k spread across both flavors of the 4013(b) and another $19k into the 457(b).  And then the employer would add another $8250 into my 4013B.  Am I right?

I'm a college student who's disputing a credit charge on my first ever credit card. I recently became unsure of my situation and I don't have anybody to get advice from regarding the matter, so I would greatly appreciate any help or knowledge that can be shared.

**Here's a summary of the situation:**

I purchased a OnePlus phone at the beginning of January- it was packaged improperly and fell out when opening the phone, and cracked. I tried to get a refund, they said I couldn't because it was damaged. After a week of trying to communicate with them, they eventually suggest I send it to their service center anyway because the damage was due to improper packaging, and I could see if they would accept that reason and refund it. I bite.

They confirmed that it was received and processed January 17 and ask me to wait two days for inspection. After the third day, the website says it hasn't been inspected, so I contact support and they tell me it had failed inspection, despite the website not reflecting that information. Now I'm getting annoyed that the info they're giving me isn't reflected on my service request on the website. They offer a paid repair. Okay, fine, I needed a working phone. They said I'll hear from the service center about that repair.

They proceed to ghost me until I'm fed up, phoneless, and starting to suspect that they literally lost the phone because the website still says it hasn't been inspected.

On January 27, after almost a month of dealing with support and my phone being shipped into oblivion, I decide to dispute the charge on my credit card, and it reflects that I got a refund on my card.

This morning, February 1, I suddenly get an influx of emails and a voicemail from OnePlus. In four emails sent within an hour, they claim to have made a new service request, processed it, received the phone, and inspected it. Then I get a voicemail from a random number; it's someone from HR saying I've been quoted $150 for repairs. Okay, this is sketchy... within a week of disputing the charge, OnePlus creates a new case and processes it within an hour, something they had failed to do for a month. And my repair is being quoted by some guy from HR on the phone despite no emails or updates on the website, which still says they'll send me further instructions via email.

So I'm wondering- is this an attempt by OnePlus to combat my payment dispute? Since they're finally offering the repair, is my dispute still valid or will I end up getting charged back? I'm really sick of the company and want to move on from them, but I don't want to end up getting charged back. What would be the best thing for me to do at this point- would I need to drop the dispute with CapitalOne and accept the repair? Or is my disputed charge still valid?",finance
personalfinance,Throw Extra Money toward Car or House or Savings?,"I'm new to this sub, but really trying to work to get my family's finances totally in shape. I just got news that I am getting a raise with retroactive back pay. The back pay will be just enough to pay off my remaining student loans (woo hoo!). I was planning to take what we've been paying on my loans and throw it at some of our other debt to pay it down more quickly, but I'm having trouble determining which is the best to pay down first. Here are our remaining debts:

Husband's student loans: ~$27k 2.625% fixed

Car: ~$9k 2.6% variable

House: ~$245k 3.75% fixed

We pay PMI on our house (we did an FHA loan), so in combination with the fact that it has the highest interest rate, I'm thinking it makes the most sense to throw any extra money there. But it's going to be quite awhile before we'd have it paid down enough to drop the PMI (we have to pay it down to around $200k) and we don't anticipate living in this house forever. 

So -- pay off the car because we can do it fairly quickly? Pay toward the house to work toward dropping the PMI? Or throw it in savings (some retirement, some emergency, some vacation/house maintenance)?

personalfinance,Buying a house. What to do with equity from sale of current home?,"Trying to figure out what is the best option is for me and my family as we purchase a new home (Texas).

Using a throwaway as I'm likely to end up divulging too much personal information.

Purchasing a home for 500k.  (499950, but 500k is easier math).  The sale of my current home will net me ~ 100k or more, and we have an additional 25k sitting in an account that we already should have had growing somewhere, but had been looking for a home and knew we might need it and I was worried about it being too tied up.

Leaving out T&amp;I as they will be the same for each scenario

Option A)

* Interest Rate: 4.75%
* 20% down (100k).  Avoid PMI.
* 400k mortgage = $2,090 Monthly P&amp;I payment.
 
Option B)
 
* Interest Rate: 4.75%
* 5% down (25k).  Pay PMI.
* 475k mortgage = $2,480 Monthly P&amp;I payment + 150 PMI
* $2,630 monthly mortgage payment
* resulting in an additional $540 out of pocket per month, but having $75k+ to do anything with. 

I'm not necessarily comfortable with this additional $500+ that would need to go to our mortgage every month, and paying PMI feels like literally flushing money down the toilet, but every time I go back to it, paying PMI and investing the 'difference' might help offset that monthly cost and be there for us if we ever got in a bind.

In the event we are comfortable with the higher monthly payments and we go with Option B, what do you do with the additional 75k?  In my head, I basically want an annuity without it being an annuity (MLP / High Dividend index).  I'm in my early 30s.

Additional information:

* I have a rental property generating $1500 per month, with a mortgage payment of $1000, which includes T&amp;I in escrow, resulting in a ($500 cash flow per month) with 108k on the mortgage @ 4.25%.

* I have a $346 per month truck payment (26k remaining on the balance) @ 2.49%.  (Drove my previous vehicle for 18 years.)

* Married 1 kid, eventually more on the way.  Not preggo yet.  Combined income approx 125k if that matters. No other debts.  Max out both mine and wife's Roth IRA every year.  And contribute to 401k / pension.

For my tax elections, I’m married and have 1 allowance. My spouses information looks correct and I don’t think it’s causing the issues (wages about $55k - tax withholding about $5k).

What could be causing such a large discrepancy? I’m completely out of my element here.

Banking,Am I calculating savings interest correctly?,"I recently switched from TD bank to DCU. No monthly fees or minimums, a TON of features in their app which has completely replaced Qapital for me and saved me the $6/month, got bonus money for myself and my sister by using her referral code. Been a good deal, so far.

But they also offer a 6.17% APY on the first $1000 in your primary(savings) account. Since the banks I've used thus far have had garbage 0.01% interest rates, or similar, I've never bothered paying any attention. So now I'm trying to figure out how it's calculated. I did Google it, but somehow, despite all of the articles and calculators out there for all sorts of accounts and interest, I couldn't find anything that specifically explained how savings account interest and payouts work.

Specifically, it says ""A dividend rate of 6.00% will be paid on your daily balance up to $1,000.00. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for this tier will be 6.17%. A dividend rate of .25% will be paid on any daily balance over $1,000.00. The APY will then range from 6.17% to .25% depending on the total account balance."" and ""Funds earn dividends from the first business day of deposit and are compounded daily and posted monthly.""

So if I keep $1000 in the account(so the average daily balance for the month would be $1k), I'm assuming I take the $1k, multiply by 6% and then divide by 12? I mean, I'm guessing they aren't paying out a full 6% every month, as nice as that would be.

So I guess it's basically $1000x6%/12 = $5/month, or $60/year. Discounting any earning from the balance over $1k, obviously. Is that correct? I feel like it should be fairly obvious, but I want to make sure.",finance

personalfinance,Getting buried in bills and can’t find a path to paying tuition,"I’ll try and keep this as short as possible. This is my current situation:

- Started college right out of high school and received a decent scholarship for a private school. The remaining balance was still high and I took on a loan for it. After the first year, I decided that the low quality of education at this institution was not worth the extra debt. 

- Looked into declaring independent status on FAFSA (no financial help from family whatsoever) and decide to wait until I’m 24 because I’m disqualified from every other metric (married, veteran, pregnant, emancipated minor, etc)

- Now I’m 25 and back in community college. I took a wage cut and am working third shift and bringing home roughly $1600/month (after health insurance etc) 

- I goofed and ended up defaulting on my prior student loan which has rendered me ineligible for student aid going forward. I entered rehabilitation this month at a cost of $110/month. 

- My rent is currently $750/month as I’m paying off the end of a lease that an ex-roommate broke off. This will end April 1st and I will then be paying $500/month under a new lease thankfully. 

- My tuition payments at the community college are $438/month. 

- Currently, after paying my rent, rehab payment, and tuition payments, I’m left with $300/month that’s somehow supposed to cover food, gas, phone, etc. I’m not able to pay all of it and am looking for advice as to which payment I could prioritize skipping until my rent goes down and my loan is rehabbed to the point of being able to reapply for FAFSA.",finance

personalfinance,Thoughts on Retirement Planning,"My first post here, so I could be preaching to the choir. Correct me if I'm horribly wrong or if this just doesn't belong here. I was just having some thoughts on finance: 

Not even thinking about income, consider the Spender who eats at restaurants like bread and butter. I'll estimate they spend over 650 per month there. Tell them to spend at the grocery store--I estimated 200--and save the rest for retirement. 

From here, there are two scenarios: the Hoarder and the Investor. He who saves under the mattress roughly 450 each month will accrue 162k over 30 years. He who invests in the market (it has ups and downs) at an average interest rate of 3%/yr will accrue 254k over the same time. \*8% seems like a best case average, so I thought I'd be less optimistic here\*

With these 3 possibilities in mind, let's say each person will spread their wealth by the month for the next 20 years. The Hoarder will have 675 a month, while the Spender will have to work part time for 650 until the day they die. The Investor will have 1058 a month, and can possibly keep the money in the market to continue accruing about 250 in interest each month to share the wealth as inheritance.

Of course I'm not considering fees for the financial advisor, but from what I gather, it could be a one time fee of 1k to 2k or an ongoing fee between 0.25% to 2%, depending on where you go. I know if I were looking at the possibility of gathering over 90k of growth, neither the flat rate nor the one time fee would bother me. \*of course, if I'm not yet financially ready for an advisor, I won't hire the service\*

I'm not even saying these numbers are perfect for retirement, just that saving a little is better than nothing at all. Moral of the story, save what you could spend on fast food and fine dining for retirement instead. Doesn't matter if you make 15k a month or 15k a year. A change in financial behaviour is all it takes to prepare for a comfortable retirement.

Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Recommendation for toddler bank account?,"My 2 year-old son is starting to get money from relatives. I'm looking for an account with:

\-nearby brick &amp; mortar branch (Phoenix, AZ)

\-gives him withdrawal rights as soon as possible (preferably immediately)

\-nonzero interest is slightly preferable

&amp;#x200B;

I know an online option gives way better interest rates, but that is a distant tertiary goal. I'd prefer that he is able to associate a tangible place with the idea of saving money.  My nearest bank is a Chase. They heavily pushed a custodial account, but he legally has no right to that money until he's 18, and in effect changes the cash that is meant for him to assets that are no longer his. They have a checkings account with minimum age of 13, but I think it's cool that when he's 14 and has things he wants to buy, he can see a decade of savings transactions that reflect a historic effort of saving.

&amp;#x200B;

They said there is technically a joint account option where he has rights to the assets immediately, but the banker was pretty cagey about it and personally felt that it was kind of ridiculous for a 2 year old to fill out the computer-based forms, even though she admitted it was not against bank policy.

I do not work as it gets me more grant money and I want all my focus to be on getting my degree in Mechanical Engineering.

Anyway, I made some poor choices in the military as many young people do and bought a car I knew I shouldn't have and racked up some credit card debt. (10k car loan, 250 a month payment, 6.4% 4 years left.)... (2k credit card, 8.24% flat interest rate, navy federal has good cards.

If I play it right each month after my bills I usually have around 200 a month to spare. Not much but that's because I have some decent bills from rent to car/insurance. (also I eat like almost 4k calories a day so a lot of my money goes to food... Sry I like to workout.

Right now I'm putting 200 a month into a Roth IRA called the thrift savings plans that I started when I was 19.(money comes out of guard check so I don't even see it). Last time I checked it was around 8,200 and I have the money diversified into various funds within it depending on interest rates and risk.

The only other investment I have is a CD I just opened up with navy federal and that's a 3.44% for a year. Was planning on maybe doing some ""laddering"" which seemed like a decent idea.

Any tips for what to do with left over money from the grants/tax return. I'd say I have around 2000k I can safely invest right now while keeping a 4 solid months of expenses in my savings.

Those are just companies I actually buy stuff from and hey it seemed like a good place to start. I don't know anything about charts, or trends for stocks either which I'm going to start researching but sometimes direct advice is better from personal experience.

investing,Earnings have slowed they aren’t good.,"I feel like I’m going crazy here but the facts are the facts.

So far with about a third of companies reporting earnings growth is coming in around 12%, sounds good but in q2-q3 we were growing earnings 24-25% 

This slowing in rate of change terms is significant. Couple this with the jobs report which shows wage growth. As revenues slow and wages go up, margins are squeezed and profits fall. 

economic cycles typically follow a sine curve and right now we are on the downward slope.

Now take earnings in 2001-2 slow down we saw a similar progression 23% in q3 2000 to 16% q4 2000  to 1% in q1 2001 then to -13 in q2 2001, and -18 in q3. 

These cycles happen. Anyone who tells you the absolute growth rate matters is blowing smoke. If you have a company earning 24% than it earns 12% do you think it’s worth more or less making 12% than when it was making 25%? Not to mention if you map the broader moves you can start to see where the economy is headed and it’s not on the fun side of the sine curve if you’re long the market.

Now this said what good is this if you don’t have a way to play it. It’s simple, treasuries. IF the market does well it’s because the fed stays dovish and bonds rally. If the market tanks the fed eases and bonds rally. Either way you want to be long bonds and out of equities.",finance

personalfinance,Just some info on the true cost of taxes.,"I have employees. For every dollar I pay them, it costs MUCH MORE in taxes (plus benefits). I think many people don't know how to figure out how much money they ACTUALLY MAKE per hour, below is an example as plain as I can make it:

I have a guy that makes $20 per hour, he has medical insurance, a company phone, a company iPad and dental insurance - Here’s a breakdown of the ACTUAL costs for me:

40 hrs/wk \* 52 wks/yr = 2080 hrs BUT he gets two weeks of paid vacation -80 hrs, six paid holidays -48 hrs and three sick days -24 hrs - so he only WORKS 1928 hrs per year. Our first takeaway is - $20\*2080 = $41,600/1928 hrs = $21.58 per hr.So he actually makes $21.58 hr before benefits.

Now, we add his benefits: Medical insurance $400 mo = $4800 yr = +$2.49 hr, company phone =$125 mo = $1500 yr = +$0.78 hr, company iPad = $125 mo = $1500 yr = +$0.78 hr, dental insurance = $55 mo = $660 yr = +$0.34 hr. All together an additional $4.39 hr. So he ACTUALLY makes $25.96 hr. If he were to discuss his salary with others - this is the number he should use - NOT $20 hr (or worse, their take home pay, sometimes they actually claim that as their salary!).

Now, the biggest hidden tax that many people don't know/talk about - Payroll taxes: What's included? For us, it's worker's compensation insurance (in case you get hurt on the job) which, because we are construction related is pretty high at almost 27% (roofers can be over 50%!!!) = $5.77 hr, general liability 2.5% = $0.54 hr, unemployment $364 yr = $0.19 hr, 1/2 of his Medicare 1.45% = $0.31 hr, 1/2 of his social security 6.2% = $1.34 hr and federal unemployment $42 yr = $0.02 hr. All together, this is an additional $8.17 hr. This is money employees never see, many don't even know that companies pay this because it is never disclosed.

Then, we take out employee paid taxes = Federal withholding 10% = -$2 hr, the other half of social security 6.2% = -$1.24 hr, the other half of Medicare 1.45% = -$0.29 hr, state withholding = $2.5% = -$0.50 hr and finally disability 1.5% = -$0.30 hr. All together this is $4.33 hr removed from his check, so he takes home $15.67 hr.

I hear many people talk about their take home pay, which is fine, take home pay is an important figure to know but as you can see in the real world example above, without including ANY other overhead costs (computers, electricity, fuel, uniforms, tools ,etc.) my employee COSTS me $34.13 hr, so that he can take home $15.67 hr. It stings a little when people say ""I only bring home X"" because it's very hard as an employer to think in terms of take home pay.

Location: Moscone South, Exhibit Level, Hall C | Smarter Business Showcase Theater B

This discussion will focus on central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and their impact on local economies and cryptocurrencies. CBDCs can be divided into two forms. A retail CBDC is a digital version of central bank fiat currency that is universally available, which entails public access to central bank liabilities, as it partially replaces banknotes. In the case of a wholesale CBDC, the accessibility to this form of money is limited to commercial banks and clearing houses that make up the interbank market. This session explores the use of CBDCs plus many types of crypto assets and the roles they can play in token economics.

* Jesse Lund, IBM
* Ram Komarraju, CLS Bank
* Tammy Camp, Stronghold

personalfinance,Cash Back on Mortgage Payments,"Hello r/personalfinance! I would like to start by saying that while I have had some issues with following the labyrinthine style posting rules in other subreddits. Somewhat paradoxically, a sub about finances, a notoriously complex topic, seems to have fairly straightforward posting rules. Even so, I certainly hope I haven't missed one and that you guys can help me out.

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma is simple. I currently have a brand new mortgage with US Bank (I did not have a choice of lender as I got a NIFA mortgage) and as is the case with most mortgage lenders, they don't accept payment from a credit card. Currently I funnel as many of my expenses as possible through my credit card since I have a plenty generous credit limit and I am meticulous about paying the card in full every month. Personally, I don't travel much so cash back is the main driver of this behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the question. Is it possible at all to find a way to get cash back on my mortgage payments? This would be wonderful since my mortgage payment is quite literally my single biggest monthly expense. I have considered several options but none has ended up with a net positive result. Below are a list of options I've already, at least shallowly, explored along with a brief explanation of the noted limitation or drawback.

&amp;#x200B;

* Paying with a credit card straight away (not an option at my mortgage lender)
* Paying with my credit card account using a ""cash advance"" (no cash back rewards and potential for instant interest rate application)
* Paying with a money order (paying for this with a credit card is not possible, at least not at Walmart)
* Using a third party like plastiq to allow credit card payments nearly anywhere (the fees on these services seems to be universally higher than my cash back options that would likely cap out at 2% for the time being)

&amp;#x200B;

If you have suggestions, please keep in mind that I would consider myself a ""competent novice"" when it comes to organizing my personal finances. However, I have run right up to the edge of my ability with this conundrum. Also, I am usually willing to put a reasonable amount of effort into saving (or earning) extra money so if any of your suggestions require some leg work on my end, as long as the time or energy I would be investing on a monthly basis isn't excessive, I'm open to many options.",finance

* Also I should probably move out eventually.. I’d rather buy a house with some land instead of an apartment. But with only one income, that's going to be kinda hard in this area unless it's a fixer-upper

Obviously, I’m going to need a car before a house. I’ve been looking online at cars and houses for over a year. I have a lot of trouble spending money on myself, and before I buy anything (even as small a purchase as like computer speakers) I spend a lot of time doing as much research as possible trying to determine the pros/cons of every option, and sleeping on the thought of buying whatever my final decision is. 

Although I have not test driven any car, I’ve been looking at some used BMWs. More specifically, a 2016 BMW 228i xDrive or 2017 BMW 230i xDrive for max $25k and less than 30k miles. I feel like this is the only time I’d be able to enjoy a luxury car like this, plus it’s AWD and a sedan! (I don’t really like driving bigger cars) But it makes me feel financially irresponsible and I know property is a much better investment.

**The question(s):**

What can I afford? What would be a financially responsible amount of money to spend on a used car? Should I be looking at cheaper used cars so I can put more money towards some property?

personalfinance,Student Loans..,"Hey r/personalfinance

&amp;#x200B;

I have a question about my student loans. I have recently re-entered a grace period because I am going back to school for my masters. I don't want my interest to get out of hand, so I am paying about half of what I normally would pay outside of a grace period. 

&amp;#x200B;

My total balance is split among around 9 accounts all with a few different interest rates and balances. Should I focus on one account or two accounts with the higher rates and get rid of them (or knock it down a bit) during the grace period or should I just let it do the default thing and spread my payment across all 9 accounts? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!",finance

Bitcoin,"Clemency for Ross Ulbricht, Serving Double Life for a Website","Ross Ulbricht is still serving a double life sentence plus 40 years, **without the possibility of parole**, for a website he made when he was 26 years old and passionate about free markets and privacy. 
**The website Silk Road was an e-commerce platform similar to eBay,** where individual users chose what to list for sale. Both legal and illegal items were sold, most commonly small amounts of cannabis and other drugs. Ross is **condemned to die in prison**, not for dealing drugs himself but for a website where others did. This is **far harsher** than the punishment for many murderers, pedophiles, rapists and other violent people. **Ross’s investigation, trial and sentencing were rife with abuse**. This includes corrupt federal investigators (now in prison) who were hidden from the jury, as well as prosecutorial misconduct, constitutional violations and reliance on unproven allegations at sentencing. **Ross did not get a fair trial and his sentence was draconian.
Justice was not served.** Ross must be judged for what he did but this sentence is purely meant to intimidate US citizens and is not, by any means, a form of justice.

**Ross was arrested in October 1, 2013** and **he has spent the last 5 years in prison.**

During all this time the **Ulbricht family has been working hard to bring Ross to home** but the **The Supreme Court denies all appeals** so the Ross's mother launched the Ross’s petition in [change.org](https://change.org/) but in June 28, 2018 The Supreme Court denies Ross's petition without comment.

Then the **Ulbricht family launches a petition for clemency addressed to Donald Trump** and now the only hope to bring Ross home is getting the President’s attention.

The **Ross petition was created 7 months ago** and have **127k signatures**. The Ulbricht family thanks a lot and Ross also give thanks from prision in their letter published on [freeross.org](https://freeross.org/):

[https://freeross.org/writings-from-ross/](https://freeross.org/writings-from-ross/)

But in my opinion, 127k signatures in 7 months for a guy serving a **double life sentence + 40 years without parole** for all non-violent charges is a very low quantity.  Like Ross says **""With you behind me, I have hope that the petition will keep growing and we will get the President’s attention. Thank you for all you’re doing on my behalf.""** but we are few people gettting really involved helping on the Free Ross's case.

**Get involved not means just sign the petition**, get involved means sign the petition and:

Sarcasm aside, yesterday I made a post that as of now has 90 upvotes despite being only 62% upvoted. There are 260 comments and counting. I wanted to hear differing viewpoints, and people had clearly been wanting to voice their opinions on BOTH sides of the issue. And they did. It got people talking. It spawned a response thread from Roger Ver and others. It spawned the linked post in question where I was accused of being a fake/camoflouged CSW shill. That guy also commented on my post and called me a shill. IDGAF.

**Reality:** I lost about 5 hours of productivity yesterday responding to as many comments in the thread as I could (at least the ones made in good faith). Now here I am on a Saturday, about to catch up on some work that I put off yesterday because I care more about bitcoin. But I don't regret it for a second. I heard some great comments from a lot of you yesterday, so thank you to those who responded. Even the ones who were trolling me.

I still don't think bitcoin will lead to an anarcho-capitalist society. However, I do understand why anarchists are here, and how their passion is not necessarily antithetical to bitcoin, that at least they're here, advocating for bitcoin adoption. I was reminded that I don't have to advocate for bitcoin and the abolition of the state in the same breath. And I won't. I'll never stop advocating for bitcoin the idea, regardless of which fork will ultimately hold the crown. 

So thanks to all of you who stopped by for the talk of the day. Look forward to discussing bitcoin with (most of) you in the future.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Pay off last debt or save 6 mo worth of expenses?,"Looking for some guidance on the best route to take first - pay off a debt vs. saving 6 months worth of expenses. 

I have one consumer debt (car loan) of $25k with a 0.9% interest rate before I will become debt free (not counting mortgage). I estimate that 6 months of expenses would equate to roughly $40k. I have roughly $30k in savings. I currently have no problem paying my monthly car payment and all other bills, although not having the car payment would obviously be nice. I have been following Dave Ramsey’s baby step program and am at a crossroads with my situation. In following his plan, technically I should pay the car loan debt first then save 3-6 months of expenses. I am in a situation where I’m relatively close to the top end of expense savings while having a debt. The rub is that the interest rate on the debt is very low. While I certainly understand that paying any interest amount should be avoided, I have close to my goal in expense savings. 

Should I pay the car loan off completely and zero my debt out? Or should I keep my liquid funds and continue building towards 6 months of expenses while paying my car payment?

If I were to go with the former, I estimate it would take 1.5-2 years to save close to $40k. 

If I were to go with the latter, I am confident that I could pay off the car within 1 year.

personalfinance,Health insurance won't coordinate benefits. Don't know what to do (xpost /r/askinsurance),"Throwaway account because my friends/family will know its me. 

**Background:** I am American. When I was a child, I moved back to the US (I was an expat abroad), but my parents lived abroad working for a foreign company. As such, I had no health insurance through my parents like most Americans. Since childhood, my family paid out of pocket for private insurance for me, before the ACA. Flash forward to 2018, where I get my first job. My employer gives me insurance. I decide to keep my private insurance anyway, for a variety of reasonable reasons that I am not looking to debate right now. As per federal rules, my personal insurance should be my primary insurance because it is the one longest in effect. So the current situation is that I have two insurances:

* **Primary Insurance:** personal carefirst bluecross blueshield grandfathered plan that I pay for with my own money. Member ID is ABC 123456 (made up number)
* **Secondary insurance:** employer-provided HSA with carefirst bluecross blueshield. Member ID is DEF 123456. I complied with federal rules to ensure I can have an HSA and personal plan. 

Two things to notice here. First, both my insurances are with the same insurer. Second, the member ID is the same except for the first three letters. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue:** As I understand it, the doctor is supposed to first send a claim to the primary insurance, then send it to the secondary. The issue is that whenever my doctor enters my primary insurance ABC 123456, their computer system automatically routes it to DEF 123456. It's like the computer system doens't know ABC 123456 exists. The DEF 123456 system then fails to adjust any claims, because it recognizes that the primary has not adjusted any claims first. I will know go step-by-step to let you guys know what I have done so far to resolve this, so that you can advise me. 

* **Step 1:** I called Carefirst's Coordination of Benefits (COB) hotline to coordinate the two insurances. I called 8662852611. I selected OPTION TWO for employer-paid insurance. I got someone on the line. I told them to make ABC 123456 (private insurance I pay for) the primary and DEF 123456 (employer insurance) the secondary. They say Ok. Issue resolved, or so I thought. 
* **Step 2:** I go to the doctor a few months later. I get the bill back with NOTHING adjusted. I owe 600$ for something that usually costs 30$. I freak out
* **Step 3:** I call the doctor's office. I ask them, ""Did you run the bill through both my insurance."" They say, ""our computer system only shows your secondary insurance as DEF 123456. There is no primary insurance on here."" I say, ""that's weird. Ok, my primary is ABC 123456. Please run that first."" The billing office says, ""hmm, when I type ABC 123456 in, the system automatically reroutes to DEF 123456."" I say, ""can you call Carefirst and ask."" Billing says, ""no, you need to ask Carefirst to call us."" Ok whatever. 
* **Step 4:** I call member benefits using the phone number ON THE BACK OF MY PRIVATE INSURANCE card. I tell them the issue. The person says, ""that's weird. On our computer system, it shows ABC 123456 as the primary and DEF 123456 as the secondary (that's correct), but there seems to be more information (I don't know what that means) for the secondary than the primary. I think COB made an error in coordination. Please call them at 8662852611."" Ok fine. Weird that I have to call all these departments and Carefirst won't centralize it, but whatever. 
* **Step 5:** I call COB. I click OPTION TWO for employer-paid insurance. I get someone on the line. I explain what the member benefits person said. The COB person says my information is correct on her system. Her system accurately shows that ABC 123456 is primary and DEF 123456 is secondary. I ask her what to do. She says to call member benefits. 

I am so frustrated. I just had a couple surgeries and I cannot afford a $20k bill right now. I am up-to-date on both insurances, so this seems so unfair. Everyone is rerouting me to everyone. The doctor refuses to call Carefirst. Carefirst refuses to call the doctor. CAREFIRST REFUSES TO CALL THEIR OWN COB OFFICE. Guys, what do I do? Should I get a lawyer? Thanks for any help!

Monthly payment: $385.79 which breaks down to $350.01 to interest and $35.78 to principal according to the last billing statement.

As of this month I'm currently in a situation we're I can afford a additional $700 payment on top of the normal $385.01.  

My question is should I apply the $700 extra each month to the principal of the loan with the highest interest rate  till payed off then move to the next and so Fourth or should I look into loan consolidation and make one to the consolidated loan.

As another option a Co-worker suggested I take a loan out from my 401k, pay the student loans off and then make payments back to my 401k at a 4.5% interest rate over time. The interest payed goes back into the 401k essentially paying my self back with interest. I can adjust the loan repayment over X amount of years to fit a payment I can afford. Also if I were to lose my job, loan will need to be repaid in full at that time. 

We both have excellent credit so shouldn't have a issue applying for a loan consolidation or any other loans.

personalfinance,Seeking Advice on Refinancing my mortgage,"Hey ya'll! I've seen some great advice from this sub in the past and I'm hoping to get some of the same. I'm planning to refinance my house sometime in the first half of 2019. I'm going to use the money to do the following:

* pay off my credit card debt ($16k - whoops) and never carry a balance again.
* make some home improvements for a total of around $10k. These will be QoL improvements that also add to the value of the house, like adding a fence to the backyard, getting some ""bonus land"" cleared out of brush and trees, resodding the yard, and cutting down a sick and dying tree - we'll be selling at some point in the next 4 years to hit a better middle school district, but we want to enjoy our house in the meantime.
* I'd like to double my emergency fund to help me have some more buffer against getting in a bad spot and needing to use a credit card for something again.

My current situation is:

* 720 credit score
* 15 yr FHA Loan @ 3.875% / $105k initially, currently $75k balance.
* Guesstimated value of my house if I had it appraised today is $130k-$140k, this is slightly less than comparable houses in my neighborhood have gone for lately but those houses had fences and nicer yards.
* $16k of 16.5k limit on a single credit card
* $8k emergency fund

My questions are:

* Does this sound like a good plan?
* Should I just go ahead and apply and see what happens?
* What can I do/not do in the next 4-5 months to:
   * ensure a smooth process through the application
   * get the best interest rate when I refinance
* I'm planning to get as aggressive as I can with the credit card payments. I think I can swing $800/mo, which should get it below $14k in 4 months. Would it be wise to immediately apply $1-2k from the emergency fund to the credit card balance to go ahead and get it down?
* What impact will it have on this if I trade in the family car for a less old family car? It is hitting that time around the 10 year mark where stuff starts to go and I think it may turn into an un-sellable money pit if I wait too long.

This is long, TL/DR below. Appreciate any advice you may have. Thanks!

So, long story...I moved into a house nearly 2 years ago (in April).  Shortly after moving in, we began receiving mail for the husband (we'll call him John Smith) and occasionally junk mail from the wife (we'll call her Rita Smith). Not strange, this happens all the time. The mailman was super helpful and made a 'return to sender' note. That didn't last too long...but again, I never thought much of it. That was until it kept happening...and all the mail is for his businesses (he had 2 at the time). He, within a year, started a new business (as far as I can tell) that is receiving mail at the house as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of the strange mail/happenings:

   \- Mail for 3 different businesses (2 insurance and 1 financial advisor). Letters from companies, packets, bills, tax documents and just general mail as far as I can tell. It is not uncommon to receive more mail for him than we do for ourselves. 

   \- Packages for his new business (he came to pick those up, only time we've had contact with him since the purchase)--stated that he forgot to change the address. This was this past October and was the first time we had seen this business name.

\- Mystery name (we'll call him Chris Peterson) registered to have package alerts with UPS and FedEx (was able to remove these) a few months after moving in.

\- Same mystery name, Chris Peterson, is constantly applying for credit cards and being denied (yes, I opened these). We get at least one a month for about 1.5 years now.

\-  Around the same time that the above started, we received a handful of credit card application requests for a John Blake (this name was oddly familiar to me, but I couldn't figure out why)

\- Starting to get worried that someone was using our address for illegal activity, I started to do some digging. And that's when it hit me...I looked at our paperwork from buying the house and John Blake was the co-signer, not John Smith. I started Googling both names and it looks like John Blake and John Smith are the same (the husband). He changed his name a few years ago because John Smith had some felonies of some sort (could only see the general statement and no specifics). 

\- So, essentially this guy has a past with the law, it could be completely minor and innocent or it might not be. I have no idea. My concerns are that this guy is obviously still using our house for the addresses of his businesses. Even making a new one that is receiving mail here. We are currently receiving all of his tax documents. How is it possible for him to run these companies without receiving vital mail?? Why would you even want to??? The mystery name (Chris Peterson) might not have anything to do with him, but I find it extremely strange that they started at the same time that John Blake was also being denied for credit cards. And that he is receiving mail here still and Chris Peterson signed up for package delivery notifications. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can any of this affect us negatively if he has businesses that are involved with anything illegal? I just checked and the most common business we receive mail for is FINALLY registered at a different location (other than our house) with the state. However, it is registered at a location that is currently being made into condos. They haven't even been finished being built and since I've lived here were an empty lot before that, how is this possible? 

&amp;#x200B;

Can any of this have any negative affect for us? We have put a lot of money into updating the house in the nearly two years we've lived here. If something goes wrong with one of his businesses is it at all possible that we'd feel any negative ramifications towards our investment? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks again for reading and providing any feedback. We are very appreciative. 

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: When going through the purchase of the house, we had signed all papers with only the wife's name on the paperwork. After they asked us to postpone our move in date (we weren't in a rush) we had to go back into the office a few days before and re-sign all documents because they now realized that they needed to add the husband to the paperwork as well. In hindsight, this may have been sketchy, though I am sure it is a common mistake. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Owned a home for nearly two years. Possibly suspicious previous owner has businesses still tied to this address. Are there any possible negative ramifications that could affect our investment/property?",finance
personalfinance,Surprise 1099--Will I Likely Need to Amend,"For the first time, I decided to be proactive and prepare my return early in late January.  I thought I had all of my necessary paperwork together, but today in the mail I received an unexpected 1099 Miscellaneous Income document.  It was from a radio conglomerate I'd won a large number of contests from last year without realizing I'd gone over the taxable threshold (total cash value is according to what I received today a little north of eight hundred dollars--I thought only single prizes of over six hundred dollars were taxed).  I logged back into FreeTaxUSA to check out their return amendment and found a direction to wait until I receive my refund, and this:

""The IRS will often automatically make a correction to your tax return for missing or incorrect W-2s or 1099s. You don't need to amend your federal tax return if the IRS corrects the error when they process your original tax return. You'll receive an IRS notice explaining the adjustment or asking for additional forms for documentation.""

I've never had to amend a return before.  Is it actually likely my oversight will be caught and corrected, or will I need to actually re-file?  This was an honest mistake on my part and I have no intention of trying to cheat and get away with anything here.",finance

My hope with this is that you will feel compelled to **do some research of your own and read from more than one source - hopefully an independent one with actual boots on the ground wherever it may be.**

Furthermore: **I resent people reducing our 20+ year struggle to rid ourselves of a horrid, merciless, dictatorship to the whims of the US.** America (and other nations, let’s not forget) surely has its own interests for supporting us at this moment In time, but the struggle is ours and of our initiative.

The argument about seeming like it’s meddling is moot. Both Maduro and Chavez have been spinning that tale of “the Yankee Empire is coming for us” for 20 years with no evidence to that; and by now nobody seriously believes it. The boy cried wolf too many times.

If anything, I resent the double standard the US held for over a decade, buying our oil with nary a peep - all the while knowing that it funded an inhuman and murderous regime. Venezuela has arguably the highest murder rate in the world but nobody said anything as long as oil kept flowing.

I left Venezuela 13 years ago, and even back then I had been shot at, bathed in tear gas, and insulted by the regime. Members of my family were kidnapped, aided and abated by the police and national guard that should have helped us. And things were comparatively nice back then vs now.

As a new American, I do not like what Trump is doing domestically but I’m grateful that the US gvmnt and the rest of the world is finally paying some attention to us. It only took thousands of deaths, famine, ruination, and the largest exodus in the Western Hemisphere’s history to get us there.

**F\*\*k Chavez. F\*\*k Maduro.** Words cannot express the rage I have toward them and their cronies. I only wish Chavez had remained alive to get his comeuppance- cancer was too easy a way out for him.

And to anyone who supports their brand of socialism/communism, I can only say: g**o live there like my countrymen live there now. Not with a wallet full of dollars (though that might get you kidnapped, so perhaps). Just a week or two. Then let’s see what you think.** Armchair, cafe-dwelling, socialists are the worst.

I honestly doubt the US has any designs to make Venezuela a puppet. It’s not worth the humongous effort and expense. All they want is our oil and we are more than glad to sell it - we have a historic relationship where both benefited. But it does make sense for the US to care about security for them and the rest of the continent. Gift horse.

I am not sure whether the policy is Trump’s, or a strategic advisor. I don’t care. I’m only glad that for the first time in 20 years, it kinda maybe sorta looks like we have a chance of ridding ourselves of this scum. They destroyed our economy, subverted our values, and ruined generations that honestly will never recover. We are a husk of the beautiful, prosperous nation we were and could have been. It will take decades to recover.

Whatever comes next can only be easier to deal with.

personalfinance,Buying or Renting- The Million Dollar Question,"I'm a college professor and I go up for tenure in 3.5 years. I'm 99% sure that I will earn tenure, but there are no guarantees in this business. My wife and I (no kids, but maybe one on the way soon) live in New Hampshire. We are trying to decide whether to continue to rent/save or buy a home now. I find myself presented with two scenarios and I'm seeking advice. To be clear, here are the numbers: \[gross income: 137k; net monthly income: $7,466; max monthly mortgage payment: $1,867; 4.5% interest rate; avg NH property tax: 2.5%; both have excellent credit; student loan debt: $20k @ 4%\].

**Scenario 1)** We have 30k for a downpayment now and based on our current finances we could afford a home valued around \~$255k (max mortgage $1,850/month). It is a high priced sellers market around here. \~$255k could buy us a decent starter home, but nothing fancy. We would then want to sell this home in 5-6 years (max) and buy our dream home. My fear, is that if I do not earn tenure, we would risk only owning the starter home for \~3 years and would thus lose about \~$40k on this deal.

**Scenario 2)** We continue to rent for 3 years at \~$1,575/month (utilities included), which is well below the rental market around here, until I get tenure. During that time, we could save \~$90k for a home downpayment. Thus, in 3.5 years time, we would have a lofty downpayment, the tenure decision, and we could afford our dream home at \~$350k. 

My gut says to wait, save, and go with scenario 2, but I also have this fear of 'missing out' on equity/homeownership, etc. Any advice folks could provide would be much appreciated! Thank you all so much.

personalfinance,"Hey /r/personalfiance, I really need your help. I have no idea if my mom is being scammed or not on Whole Life Insurance.","Hey /r/personalfiance, I really need your help.  I have no idea if my mom is being scammed or not.

I read /r/personalfiance a lot and every time I see a thread about whole life insurance, everyone says it is a scam.   I am wondering if this applies in this situation as well.

My mom is in the US, 58, disabled, and receives disability and is on food stamps.  She has been in poor health in general.  She has had uterine cancer and thyroid cancer.  Over the last 5 years, my mom has had leukemia twice.  We thought she was out of the clear about a year ago, but the doctors told us that it had returned.  After, treatment again, they said they do not see any signs of the cancer right now.

Since she is on a fixed income and in poor health, and obviously does not have anything saved up, she is worried about funeral costs.  I am not in a position to help her.

Well, an agent told her she could get whole life insurance which could help cover her funeral costs, but I have no idea if this is a good idea.

I will give the details to the best of my ability.

It says it is a whole life insurance with graded death benefits.  Chronic Illness Accelerated Benefit Rider.  Provides for the advance of the death benefit under the base contract if the insured is chronically ill.  No rider charge.  It also says Terminal Illness Accelerated Benefit Rider.  Provides for 1 time payment in advance of the death benefit under the base contract if the insured is terminally ill with 24 months or less to live.  The amount advanced will be carried as a lien against the future contract benefits.  There is no charge for this rider.  However, there is a 1 time charge up to $250 if you choose to activate this rider.

It says policy year 1- 20, annual premiums each year at 450, guaranteed cash value that starts at 0 the first year and looks like it increases close to 200 dollars a year and then stops at 3,400 dollars in the 20th year.  It also says guaranteed death payment.  First year and second year says 110% of premiums paid.  Then after that it says 8,500 for every year after.

It says the loan interest is 8% fixed.  Guaranteed interest rate 4.25%

It says it covers natural death or accidental death.

But it also says: We will not pay any benefit under this policy for accidental death if the insured’s death is caused or contributed to by disease or infirmity of mind or body, or medical or surgical treatment for such disease or infirmity.  Which seems like an instant disqualifier to me, but they want to issue this policy to her.

I have no idea if this is a good idea and I have no idea how to explain to her if this is a good idea or bad idea.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Bitcoin,Why Crypto Will Be King,"Ok, lets look at the history of why crypto currency was invented. Crypto was invented after the last major recession that we had. From that recession bitcoin went from pennies to Thousands of pounds. It's going to take the next recession for crypto to just go to the next level. It's going to be madness. The problem is the next recession is not going to be long and i'm afraid that people are even less prepared for this one than the last crash. You see what the federal reserve did after the last crash was that they charged low interest so people and businesses took out cheap loans. I don't really think the fed had much choice to do that because the economy was totally screwed. Now the main problem was that never in history has the interest rates been so low for so long. When the federal reserve puts the interest rates up, which they eventually will do, then BOOM!. You're going to see a recession that'll be so hard to recover. That's when bitcoin really does make it's mark. It's already had a taste of what it's capable of when it went to like £15,000, the next recession could see that happen again within days in my opinion. That's not even taking account of what bitcoin actually is, and that's a technology.

personalfinance,College student selling a patent and i need some advice on managing the income,"So I’m in the late stages of selling my first patent to an investor and I recognize that I’m abysmal with money. 


The sale is most likely going to be 70k plus royalties which for me is an astronomical amount but I understand that it’s not that much is the context of life overall. 


As the title says I’m a college student with about 2 more years until I graduate. I have about 60k is student loans, 2k in credit card debt, and about 6k left on my car payment. 


I’m definitely thinking step one would be to pay off my car and credit card bills to ease up on everything. Next I’d really like to buy a bed as currently I’m sleeping on a futon and it’s starting to not cut it, buying a few niceties off of amazon that yes I don’t need but really want, and lastly setting aside rent money for the remainder of college.


Theirs two things I’m the most worried about me being stupid about.


The first one is I’m looking at leasing a new truck. My logic with that is I’m currently paying about $150 a month on just new parts keeping my current car alive not including basic maintenance and all that other fun stuff and leasing means I’m not blowing all of my money on a new car while also getting the benefits of owning a new car. Also if i go with leasing I’m thinking I’ll do a one payment lease to save a little money and that way I don’t have to make any car payments until a year after I graduate college and hopefully have a full time job in witch I’ll probably buy out whatever vehicle i lease.


The other is do i put a lot of money into my college loans or into the second company I’ve been starting up? Regardless there’s a few college loans i want to pay off that are particularly poor interest rates but the remaining amount can go into either funding my second company or paying of student loans.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on a path forward - Sacrificing time for security?,"My wife and I were talking today and we are both extremely frustrated. We are both early-mid 30's and just can't seem to feel any gains.

Every month seems to be a struggle. I know we are ""doing ok"" but we just can't do anything productive.

We just filed our taxes today and found out we owe $800 for Federal taxes which spurred this conversation. This is after we just paid $900 to have our car fixed in Jan and have multiple medical bills from a procedure I needed done at the end of last year ($5000 total out of pocket)

We make about $120k pre-tax combined and live in MD outside of Annapolis - where we know cost of living is high. But this is crazy. We bought a ""fixer upper"" for $420k.

Our currently month budget is about $6k - mortgage is 2k, food about 1k, utilities $500-600 pending on quarterly water bill, $400 in child care (which is extremely cheap), $500 in recreation (mostly stuff for our daughter), $500 in stuff just trying to keep our head above water like repairing the cars or medical bills, $500 a month for home repairs. The remainder goes to gas, insurance, dogs, etc. We also have 2 paid off cars (that will need replaced in the next 4-5 years)

We have 0 debt, 3 months emergency savings, about $250k in our 401k (9% of my income+6% company match). $20k saved for a kitchen which we are trying to plan in the next few years. We are big-time Dave Ramsey followers - which has been huge to get us to this point - but when do we let off the gas?

We moved around every year so I recently took a different job which has cut my income almost in half to have stability when my daughter was born (150k down to 75k) - so that's how we've been able to get to this point, but we have hit a wall. We have never been on a vacation due to paying off student loan debt, we can't seem to get enough ""free cash"" to do anything. There is always some crisis that we have to spend $1000/month. Dec was prepping for medical bills, Jan was the car, Feb is now taxes, March we have car registrations - where does it end?

I know just in the next few years we will both need cars, a roof, possibly mechanical house stuff (HVAC, water heater, etc). At the rate we are going - there is no way to save enough money to handle these things. This isn't a ""don't buy coffee or cancel cable and save $1000/year"" - the pressure seems like 20k-30k in the next 3-4 years. A slowly sinking ship.

We have the following questions.

Are we alone in this feeling?

We see people going out and enjoying life - but we ask ourselves how much ""time"" we should be sacrificing for continuing to try to save?

I feel the need to get a part-time job which is crazy with a combined income of 120k - what are we doing wrong?

Any advice is appreciated.",finance

\- I am single without a child or a dependent.

\- 2 of my jobs are retail and 1 of my job was the food industry/cafe.

\- I live in Seattle, Washington State.

\- Edit: I got 3 W-2 (one from each employer).

\- Edit: To just clarify, I worked for 2 companies from Jan - June (but barely made anything like 2k for one job). However, I quit the main job and the venue I worked at changed its parent company (the one I barely made any money with) and I had to transition to the new third company. Thus, I worked for only 1 company after July.

personalfinance,How to get tax refund from an overpayment?,"I had an overpayment in 2018 resulting from paying back a signing bonus, but I'm not sure how to handle getting the overpayment back as a refund.

I received a signing bonus from an employer in 2017, but I left the company before the 1 year mark, so I had to return the signing bonus in 2018, including the federal and state taxes that were originally withheld. The employer didn't send me a W2-c or anything like that, so my 2017 W2 just shows the full amount of the signing bonus as income, and I didn't receive a 2018 W2 from that employer.

What are the steps I should take to get the federal and state taxes refunded back to me? I'm a nonresident for tax purposes if that makes any difference.",finance

personalfinance,Anyone have any experience on rolling over tax credits?,"Usually every year my taxes are usually really simple, until this year all I had was a W-2 (1099s now since I discovered high-interest savings accounts, thanks PF). This year though I got a K-1 1041 tax credit from the closing of my Grandma’s estate, and now I have the good problem of having a more complicated tax return.

The good problem is this though:

K-1 Credit: $13,567
Taxes (Fed,SS,Medicare): 3,587.46 + 2,852 + 667.02= $7,106.48

The credit is more than what I paid in taxes, but apparently this credit can be rolled over applied to following tax years until the credit is used up.

My question is do I keep track of how much credit I have for next years return, and do input that number into the boxes as I will for the K-1 this year? Am I completely misunderstanding how to go about this and need to seek out a preparation service?",finance

personalfinance,Using mortgage as investment account,"Shower though so forgive the lack of
Doing the math yet, but...

I have a house in Washington DC that is doing quite well.
It’s gone up 36,000 in 2.5 years based on three different realtor sites and it’s about to have a brand new organic grocery store next to it. 
Hoping this keeps the momentum going.

I pay the min on the mortgage plus an extra 1000 a month on the principal.

I currently have about 30,000 extra dollars that are sitting in a min savings account.
Leftovers from selling my car, a good savings year and a few other things.

If my house is going up so well in a high income high growth area like DC, would putting the 30,000 towards my principal be a decent vehicle for growth?

I see it as: beating the interest rates I can get from a CD, bond or stocks ( the market would probably outperform over long periods but I’d like to sell my house in 2 more years )

This will bring my house down to 250 out of 350.
Might be time to refinance, see if I can get a better rate ( current is 3.1 )

Keeps the money out of my hands and keeps me from spending it.

1200  By the time Marco Polo visited China they’d move from coins to paper money, who introduced the concept to Europe. An inscription warned, ""All counterfeiters will be decapitated."" Before the use of paper, the Chinese used coins that were circular, with a rectangular hole in the middle. Several coins could be strung together on a rope. Merchants in China, if they became rich enough, found that their strings of coins were too heavy to carry around easily. To solve this problem, coins were often left with a trustworthy person, and the merchant was given a slip of paper recording how much money they had with that person. Marco Polo's account of paper money during the Yuan Dynasty is the subject of a chapter of his book, The Travels of Marco Polo, titled ""How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees, Made Into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All Over his Country.""

1586 The Babington Plot

1590 Cabinet Noir was established in France. Its mission was to open, read and reseal letters, and great expertise was developed in the restoration of broken seals. In the knowledge that mail was being opened, correspondents began to develop systems to encrypt and decrypt their letters. The breaking of these codes gave birth to modern systematic scientific code breaking.

1600s Promissory banknotes began in London

1600s By the early 17th century banking begins also to exist in its modern sense - as a commercial service for customers rather than kings. – Late 17th century we see cheques slowly gains acceptance

The total of the money left on deposit by a bank's customers is a large sum, only a fraction of which is usually required for withdrawals. A proportion of the rest can be lent out at interest, bringing profit to the bank. When the customers later come to realize this hidden value of their unused funds, the bank's profit becomes the difference between the rates of interest paid to depositors and demanded from debtors.

The transformation from moneylenders into private banks is a gradual one during the 17th and 18th centuries. In England it is achieved by various families of goldsmiths who early in the period accept money on deposit purely for safe-keeping. Then they begin to lend some of it out. Finally, by the 18th century, they make banking their business in place of their original craft as goldsmiths.

1668 Bank of Sweden – today the 2nd oldest surviving bank

1694 First Central Bank established in the UK was the first bank to initiate the permanent issue of banknotes

Served as model for most modern central banks.

The modern banknote rests on the assumption that money is determined by a social and legal consensus. A gold coin's value is simply a reflection of the supply and demand mechanism of a society exchanging goods in a free market, as opposed to stemming from any intrinsic property of the metal. By the late 17th century, this new conceptual outlook helped to stimulate the issue of banknotes.

1700s Throughout the commercially energetic 18th century there are frequent further experiments with bank notes - deriving from a recognized need to expand the currency supply beyond the availability of precious metals.

1990s Cryptowars really heat up...

1990s Some countries started to change their laws to allow ""truncation""

1990s Encryption export controls became a matter of public concern with the introduction of the personal computer. Phil Zimmermann's PGP cryptosystem and its distribution on the Internet in 1991 was the first major 'individual level' challenge to controls on export of cryptography. The growth of electronic commerce in the 1990s created additional pressure for reduced restrictions.\[3\] Shortly afterward, Netscape's SSL technology was widely adopted as a method for protecting credit card transactions using public key cryptography.

He distributed a freeware version of PGP when he felt threatened by legislation then under consideration by the US Government that would require backdoors to be included in all cryptographic products developed within the US. Expanded the market to include anyone wanting to use cryptography on a personal computer (before only military, governments, large corporations)

# **Jobs report removes some fear, but market still in 'tug of war' over how much growth is slowing  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/01/jobs-report-removes-some-fear-but-market-still-in-tug-of-war-over-how-much-growth-is-slowing.html)**
*****
&gt; After January's strong jobs report calmed some recession fears, investors will be picking through the next wave of earnings reports and economic data for clues on just how much the U.S. economy could be slowing.
*****
&gt; Dozens of earnings, from companies like Alphabet, Disney and Eli Lily, report in the week ahead, and there are just a few economic reports like trade data and ISM services on Tuesday. Investors will also be watching the outcome of Treasury auctions for $84 billion in Treasury notes and bonds Tuesday through Thursday, after the Fed's dovish tone helped put a lid on interest rates in the past week.
*****
&gt; Nearly half the S&amp;P 500 companies had reported for the fourth quarter by Friday morning, and 71 percent beat earnings estimates, while 62 percent have beaten revenue estimates. But earnings growth forecasts for the first quarter continue to decline as more companies report, and they are currently barely breaking even at under 1 percent growth, versus the 15 percent growth in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; ""Granted the more we hear from companies, and particularly in terms of their guidance and projections on revenues, things can slowly change. The first thing companies do is they stop spending money. Cap spending slows down, and if revenue growth does not pick up, they let people go. This is still wait and see,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; Krosby said the 304,000 jobs added in January did ease some concerns about a slowing economy, as did a stronger than expected ISM manufacturing report Friday. But the view of the first quarter is still unclear, as many economic reports were missed during the government shutdown. Economists expect growth in the first quarter of just above 2 percent, after growth of about 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; Stocks closed out January with a sharp gain on Thursday, and started February on Friday on a flattish note. The S&amp;P 500 has rebounded about 15 percent from its Dec. 24 closing low. Last month's 7.9 percent gain was the best performance for January in more than 30 years.
The old Wall Street adage says 'so goes January, so goes the year.' If that holds, stocks could finish 2019 higher. But February is another story, and on average, it is a flat month for the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; ""The tug of war that you saw in the market, that was going on in the last half of last year is playing out in the data. Some of the data is a bit lower, but some of the economic surprises are picking up to the upside rather than downside,"" said Krosby.
*****
&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the ISM may have improved but it reflected very low exports and flat backlogs, even though there was a snap back in new orders.
*****
&gt; ""I would fade the jobs report,"" said Boockvar, noting the level of growth may have been inflated by government workers taking on part-time jobs during the government shutdown.
*****
&gt; Boocvkar said the jobs report also looked strong on the surface, but he's concerned the unemployment rate ticked up to 4 percent from 3.9 percent.
*****
&gt; ""The question of whether we go into a recession or not is how does the stock market affect confidence?"" Boockvar said. Confidence readings in the past week were low, and consumer sentiment Friday was its lowest since before President Donald Trump took office.
*****
&gt; Krosby said stocks could test recent lows or put in a higher low. If there's a big selloff, ""That would not necessarily mean it was a clue a recession is coming. It's just a normal testing mechanism,"" she said.
*****
&gt; The Fed removed a big concern from the markets in the past week, when its post-meeting statement and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's briefing tilted dovish, assuring markets the Fed would pause in its interest rate hiking. Investors had feared the Fed would hurt the softening economy with its rate hikes. Now, the biggest fears are about the trade war between the U.S. and China and slowing Chinese growth.
*****
&gt; The jobs report, and the ISM manufacturing data were also important because the lack of data during the government's 35 day shutdown has left gaps in the economic picture.
*****
&gt; ""This is really a sign the Fed stole the thunder from the economic data. By saying they're patient plasters over any kind of economic data in the near term, and I suspect the near term lasts through the first quarter because of the government shutdown, the weather, weak GDP,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
*****
&gt; Chandler said the markets will be hanging on any news on the trade talks with China. ""Even if it's not the all encompassing trade deal we were promised, it's a return to where we were before with China promising to buy energy and farm products. We'll continue to have some kind of talks with the China, like we had under Obama and Bush,"" said Chandler.

# Now What?

&gt; What a year it has been. After the worst December for stocks in 87 years that contributed to the worst fourth quarter since the 2008–09 financial crisis, stocks have bounced back in spectacular fashion. In fact, with a day to go, stocks are looking at their best first month of the year in 30 years.

&gt; What could happen next? “We like to say that the easy 10% has been made off the lows and the next 10% will be much tougher,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Things like Fed policy, China uncertainty, and overall global growth concerns all will play a part in where equity markets go from here.”

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 Index about 10% away from new highs, we do think new highs are quite possible at some point this year. Positive news from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and China trade talks, as well as the realization by investors that the odds of a recession in 2019 are quite low could spark potential new highs. Remember, fiscal spending as a percentage of overall gross domestic product (GDP) is higher this year than it was last year. Many think the tax cut and fiscal policies in play last year were a one-time sugar high. We don’t see it that way and expect the benefits from fiscal policy to help extend this economic cycle at least another year—likely more.

&gt; As we head into February, note that it hasn’t been one of the best months for stocks. In fact, as our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, February has been virtually flat, and over the past 20 years only June and September have shown worse returns. Overall, the market gains have been quite impressive since the December 24 lows, but we wouldn’t be surprised at all to see a near-term consolidation or pullback.

# A Fed Pause and the Flattening Yield Curve

&gt; Investors have increasingly positioned for a Federal Reserve (Fed) pause, which could portend a shift in fixed income markets. Fed fund futures are pricing in about a 70% probability that the Fed will keep rates unchanged for the rest of 2019, and the market’s dovish tilt has weighed on short-term rates.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 2-year yield has typically followed the fed funds rate since policymakers began raising rates in December 2015. While we expect one or two more hikes this cycle, there is a possibility that the Fed’s December hike was its last, which will likely cap short-term rates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Short-Term-Rates-Poin-to-Fed-Pause.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Short-term yields have outpaced longer-term yields over the past few years, flattening the yield curve and raising concerns that U.S. economic progress may not be able to keep up with the Fed’s tightening. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yield has fallen negative before every single U.S. recession since 1970.

&gt; If the Fed pauses, the curve will likely reverse course and steepen as solid economic growth and quickening (but manageable) inflation drives longer-term yields higher. As mentioned in our Outlook 2019, FUNDAMENTAL: How to Focus on What Really Matters in the Markets, we’re forecasting the 10-year Treasury yield will increase significantly from current levels and trade within a range of 3.25–3.75% in 2019.

&gt; “We remain optimistic about U.S. economic growth prospects, and recent data show inflation remains at manageable levels,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Because of this, we expect the data-dependent Fed to be less aggressive than initially feared, as policymakers juggle these factors with the impacts of trade tensions and tepid global growth.”

&gt; To be clear, investors shouldn’t fear a flattening yield curve given the backdrop of solid economic growth and modest inflation. Historically, the yield curve has remained relatively flat or inverted for years before some recessions started. Since 1970, the United States has entered a recession an average of 21 months after the yield curve inverted.

# Jobless Claims’ Historic Significance

&gt; Jobless claims have dropped to a 49-year low. Based on historical trends, this could signal that a U.S. economic recession is further off than many expect.

&gt; Data released January 24 showed jobless claims fell to 199K in the week ending January 18, the lowest number since 1969 and far below consensus estimates of 218K. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, current jobless claims have been significantly lower than those in the 12-month periods preceding each recession since the early 1970s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/initial-jobless-claims-defy-recession-fears.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Jobless claims have fallen out of the spotlight as the economic cycle has matured, but they could prove important again as investors’ recessionary fears increase. While most labor-market data serve as lagging indicators of U.S. economic health, jobless claims are a leading indicator. Historically, a 75–100K increase in claims over a 26-week period has been associated with a recession.

&gt; “Last week’s jobless claims print was particularly impressive given the partial government shutdown and weakening corporate sentiment,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “The U.S. labor market remains strong and will help buoy consumer health and output growth this year.”

&gt; Other predictive data sets have signaled U.S. recessionary odds are low. Data last week showed the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI), based on 10 leading economic indicators (like jobless claims, manufacturers’ new orders, and stock prices), grew 4.3% year over year in December. In contrast, the LEI has turned negative year over year before all economic recessions since 1970. Because of its solid predictive ability, the LEI is a component of our Recession Watch Dashboard.

# Best S&amp;P January Since 1987

&gt; Most major U.S. stock indexes rallied to new recovery and year-to-date highs today shrugging off some misses and weakness from Microsoft, DuPont and Visa. S&amp;P 500 finished the month strong with a 7.9% gain. This is the best S&amp;P January since 1987. This is also the third January Trifecta in a row. 

&gt; Last year the S&amp;P 500 crumbled in the fourth quarter under the weight of triple threats from a hawkish and confusing Fed, a newly divided Congress and the U.S. trade battle with China, finishing in the red. 2017’s Trifecta was followed by a full-year gain of 19.4%, including a February-December gain of 17.3%. As you can see in the table below, the long term track record of the Trifecta is rather impressive, posting full-year gains in 27 of the 30 prior years with an average gain for the S&amp;P 500 of 17.1%. 

&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.5% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .739 batting average. 

&gt; Our January Indicator Trifecta combines the Santa Claus Rally, the First Five Days Early Warning System and our full-month January Barometer. The predicative power of the three is considerably greater than any of them alone; we have been rather impressed by its forecasting prowess. This is the 31st time since 1949 that all three January Indicators have been positive and the twelfth time (previous eleven times highlighted in grey in table below) this has occurred in a pre-election year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e9cf3f0f44827a9f7189f0810f19571/tumblr_inline_pm9jeiqYwm1spdppr_500.jpg))**

&gt; With the Fed turning more dovish and President Trump tacking to the center and meeting with China and market internals improving along with the gains, the market is tracking Base Case and Best Case scenarios outlined in our 2019 Annual Forecast. Next eleven month and full-year 2019 performance is expected to be more in line with typical Pre-Election returns.

# February Almanac: Small-Caps Tend to Outperform

&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is not all that stellar. February ranks no better than seventh and has posted paltry average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.1% in February since 1979—just the seventh best month for that benchmark.

&gt; In pre-election years, February’s performance generally improves with average returns all positive. NASDAQ performs best, gaining an average 2.8% in pre-election-year Februarys since 1971. Russell 2000 is second best, averaging gains of 2.5% since 1979. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000, the large-cap indices, tend to lag with average advances of around 1.0%.

# 5% Months

&gt; 7%? Bulls will take it! After an abysmal December, the S&amp;P 500 is currently set to finish the month with its best January return since 1987. This month’s gain will mark the 16th time since the lows of the Financial Crisis in March 2009 that the S&amp;P 500 has rallied more than 5% in a given month. The table below highlights each of the 15 prior months where the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 5% and shows how much the S&amp;P 500 gained on the month as well as its performance on the last trading day of the month and the first trading day of the subsequent month.

&gt; When looking at the table, a few things stand out. First, the first trading day of a month that follows a month where the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 5% has been extremely positive as the S&amp;P 500 averages a gain of 0.84% (median: 1.01%) with positive returns 13 out of 15 times! In addition to the positive tendency of markets on the first day of the new month, there has also been a clear tendency for the S&amp;P 500 to decline on the last trading day of the strong month. The average decline on the last trading day of a strong month has been 0.09% with positive returns less than half of the time. This is no doubt related to the fact that funds are forced to rebalance out of equities to get back inline with their benchmark weights. However, on those five prior months where the S&amp;P 500 bucked the trend and was positive on the last trading day of a 5%+ month, the average gain on the first trading day of the next month was even stronger at 1.52% with gains five out of six times.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week ahead?

*****

Have a fantastic Sunday and a great trading week ahead to all here on r/stocks! ;)",finance
personalfinance,Pulling money out of retirement early worth the penalty?,"Hey guys, my friend wants to pull out his retirement from his IRA to pay off some high interest debt. I've always heard that you'll take a 10% penalty plus income tax at your tax rate. His reply was that you'll be taxed no matter when you take it out anyway so it's really just a 10% penalty which is still lower than his interest rate debt he's going to pay off. From everything I've heard, it sounds like a bad idea but his logic sounded pretty reasonable. Mathematically, which option is correct? Take it out or leave it?",finance
stocks,BMW (BMW.F) stock analysis,"The car industry is up for some interesting years. Climate change and the need to move away from fossil fuels makes the industry an interesting opportunity for investors. Both Volvo and BMW have already announced that in the next few years, all their models will at least be partly electrically driven. On top of that multiple countries have stated years from which the sale of petrol- or diesel driven cars will be prohibited.

&amp;#x200B;

In light of these changes the Bavarian BMW is an interesting stock to keep an eye on. The company is doing well in Europe, the United States and Chine. Also the company is working hard to get their electrically driven vehicles on the same performance level as their petrol driven models. Their relatively big investments in improving their electrically driven models is currently a burden on their profit margins, but in the long term this should pay off.

&amp;#x200B;

The i-series electrical vehicles of the company especially stand out because of their lightweight bodywork made out of carbon fibre. On top of that BMW has patented a smart way to connect the Samsung batteries they use for their electrical vehicles. Thanks to this technique of connecting the batteries they are capable of producing a battery big and stable enough to efficiently power a car. Even before the big Volkswagen scandal with their tamper software, BMW was one of the few European carmakers that really embraced sustainability. Carbon fibre is energy intensive in its production, but the German carmaker only uses sustainable sources for its production. They, for example, have four large windturbines in Leipzig that deliver enough energy for the whole production process. De factory in Washington is fully fed from electricity generated from waterpower. They have also developed a plan to be able to dismantle every car from the i-series to re-use 95% of its materials.

&amp;#x200B;

The share is currently at a p/e ratio of 5.756 compared to an average of 8.262 for the past 5 years. Compared them to their competitors they also do pretty well on this ratio: Fiat Chrysler - 7.178, Ford  - 10.0, Audi - 8.265, Daimler - 6.014, Volvo - 9.114. Also the dividend yield of around 5% is very good compared to the rest of the industry.

An analysis of the future of automotive cannot be done without taking a look at Tesla. In my opinion the Tesla stock is still way overpriced. Their market cap per vehicle produced is currently at around $500k, their p/e ratio was -53.67 and is predicted to be 164.18 in 2019. Although they are a very strong brand, Tesla is facing increasing competition from industry giants, which make it seem like tough times are ahead for Elon Musks car company.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think about BMW?",finance
personalfinance,"Converted IRA to Roth, what is my ""basis"" for reporting state taxes?","For my 2017 tax return I contributed $5500 to an IRA. At the end of 2018 I converted it to a ROTH IRA (valued $4538 at time of conversion). I got the 1099R and reported it in Turbotax just fine for the Federal Return so I would pay the federal tax. For the PA state return it is asking me this:

Tell Us About Your Retirement Income
Enter basis of the retirement income of $4538 received from Vanguard Fiduc.
How Do I Know My Basis?
	Basis of Retirement Income Learn More	

It sounds like I need to put $4538 as my basis in the textfield because I made the contributions in PA and not a different state. I also read that PA taxes 401K/IRA distributions so this seems to make sense so I don't pay the tax again.

After I put $4538 in the box and hit Next the amount of taxes I owed to PA went down $139.

Does this sound right? Thanks all.",finance
personalfinance,Keep saving for a downpayment or pay off the student loans?,"My wife and I have about $32,000 saved up for a downpayment on a house.  This money is sitting in a high yield savings account earning approx 2%.   Mind you, we are in one of the most expensive housing markets in the country.  Median home prices in our area are $650K but we are looking around the $500k range.  Most people seem to put 5% down on homes but we would like to do a minimum of 10% or even more.

We also have about $19K in student loan debt at varying interest rates:

$5K at 4.6%

$12k at 5.6%

$3K at 3.8%

&amp;#x200B;

The combined payment on these student loans is $400 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

We don't want to put the downpayment money in the market, but it seems silly to let it accrue 2% when we have $19k in debt at over 2%.  At the same time paying off the $19k in debt sets us back on saving for a downpayment quite a bit.  We've read countless Nerdwallet types sites about this dilemma but they do not seem to actually offer advice, just regurgitated stats and talking points.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured some of you would want more budget details so I included them here:

Currently every month we are saving:

$650 in IRAs (this is on top of contributions to our pension fund-we are both teachers)

$400 for a new car/current car maintenance

$250 for vacations

$1500 for a downpayment on a house

$150 set aside monthly for car insurance premiums

$150 set aside for MA tuition.  The MA gives me a considerable pay bump and is mostly covered by a fellowship.  I will finish paying for this in by the end of the calendar year.

&amp;#x200B;

We bring in about $6500 per month after taxes, health insurance premiums and union and pension contributions.   We have no CC debt, no other debt.  We also have a 9-month emergency fund.  The rest of the budget is taken up by:

Rent $1450 

Utilities: $200 (includes water, gas, electric, insurance, internet)

Phones: $110

Food: $500

Everything else is misc: health care costs, gym, etc.

personalfinance,Cosigning for Car - Odd Additional Info Requested?,"My brother asked me to cosign on a car he wants to lower his interest rate, so I said yes because he makes good money and I know he'll pay on time. The dealer called me and asked how much money I make and asked for my social security number. Before we got off the phone, the dealer also said he needs some other things from me and that he will email what he needs. I received an email a few hours later and opened it. 

Because I've never cosigned for a car, the additional information needed from me in the email confuses me. The dealer now needs:


**The vin number on my car.** What does my car have to do with cosigning?

**A picture of my odometer.** Again, what does my car have to do with cosigning?

**He needs me to add the car that my brother is trying to buy to my insurance.** This doesn't make sense because my brother is going to get his own insurance on the car. Why do I need to add his car to my insurance? That'll just increase my insurance.

personalfinance,Investing at a younger age?,"I’m 22, and make 67k a year; my take home is 1.9k twice monthly after taxes and a 5% retirement contribution. Although I spend some of it wastefully, and some of it less wastefully, I’ve been putting about 750$ a month into my savings account at US Bank, which has an incredibly low interest rate - with over 20k in savings, I make 0.80$ a month. Soon, I’ll be getting a fairly large raise and I intended to put most of that money in savings too. 

I’m starting to think about other options, because this doesn’t seem like a good use of my money. I have 9k left on my student loan, which has a rate a little under 5%. I’m not sure if an HSA might be a good idea, since I have a lot of healthcare expenses and only anticipate more. I also hear a lot about Roth IRAs.

personalfinance,Because of one form this year TurboTax wouldn’t let me use their free version to file my taxes,"When I say by hand, I mean outside of the free softwares that make the process pretty and intuitive. I’m not sure if this matches the rules so please advise if this is considered a post that breaks rules. I wanted to just highlight my experience and say as much as it sucked to tread through it wasn’t that bad. I have friends and family that pay people to do their taxes or file state taxes and it isn’t necessary unless you have a really convoluted tax situation. W

I moved states this year so I have to file partial/nonresident with both states. I also had an unauthorized withdrawal from an old 401k from an old job ($63 so below threshold to stay in account) and I couldn’t see rolling over such a small amount into my pension. So that requires a 1099-R. 

I tried to file my taxes on TurboTax. They wait until the very end to be like “Lol btw because you have to file a 1099-R form this year so you can’t use the free version. So you will have to pay us $40 to upgrade.” I was like, yeah no. I always get a small return since I claim as much as I can so not worth that. 

So I went to free tax USA. They were like cool your federal is done but it will be $13 per state to file those. No, again. Send my federal. 

So here’s the really fun part. To do state returns free you have to go to each state’s department of revenue and file them. So I started with CO. The fun thing about state returns through DOR is that they’re not clean and pretty like turbo tax. Oh no. They’re just basically electronic forms of the original forms 🙃

So I spend an hour trying to decipher wtf this one thing is asking me. And it isn’t adding up to what is on my federal 1040. Then I notice finally that it has the term schedule 1 in it. So I look that up. Find out that there’s a 1040 form and then there are various schedules for other reported incomes and capital gains. Schedule 1 is for stuff like gambling which didn’t apply to me. I only have 1040 and schedule 4 this year. 

Okay fine whatever. It’s fixed. THEN it’s like scan all W-2, 1040, and 1099-R forms and attach them. MOTHERFUUUUU. Okay fine cool. Done. On to SC. 

SC: Oh btw if filing as a nonresident or partial resident you can’t file online. You have to actually print out the 1040, the 1040 schedule NR, all of your W2, 1040 fed, and 1099-R, fill them all in by hand and mail them to us because fuck you that’s why. 

**flips table**

For a $23 return and mailing costs I’m wondering if SC is worth dealing with. Also don’t understand why CO let’s you efile regardless of residency but SC is like nah we need you to jump through these hoops and use more of our tax dollars to file us paper. 

On the bright side in the three hours that this debacle took to do last night, I leveled up on doing taxes. And filing by hand wasn’t that hard. There were booklets that explained things. I was just trying to get it done pending another shut down. So don’t pay $300 for a CPA to do your taxes and don’t pay $13 to file your state taxes. Just read carefully and take your time.",finance

personalfinance,Child Savings Plan - Monthly Contribution vs Lump Sum,"Hi, all.  Looking for some opinions and advice. My wife and I recently had our first child who is 4 months.  He is doing great and we are adjusting to the parenting life.  I had a question regarding saving for his college.  I'll go into more financial details but basically, I was going to save about $100/mo in a 529 plan, however I have the money right now in a taxable investment account to make a larger lump some payment.  I'm thinking it would make more sense to make one large lump sum payment now to take more advantage of the 529 plan and just add the $100/mo back to my savings.

&amp;#x200B;

A few details about my finances.  My wife and I are pretty frugal and make decent money.  The only debt we have is our mortgage which is $185k @ 3.75% interest rate.  We have about $110k combined in retirement savings and we now contribute about $20k a year to this.  Just bumped this up recently but think we should be pretty good for retirement savings at this rate.  We have about $90k saved up in a taxable investment account.  There isn't a specific goal for this account really other than I would like to get to the point where this account could generate enough capital gains/interest to cover trips and other luxuries.  

&amp;#x200B;

After our expenses and daycare (yikes $$), we have about $600 in our budget left over. I was going to contribute about $100/mo to the 529 plan and $500 to our savings.  My wife paid for all our her schooling.  I had a lot of help but paid for about 25% of my undergrad and paid for my masters.  I was grateful for the help I had with my undergrad and allowed us to save/pay other debt off.  We would like to be able to help for his schooling, but don't feel the need to pay for all of it.  Want him to have to still think about the expenses of school and getting a degree.  We can see how things go, if we are all set when we are older and he's doing the right things maybe we could pay for more. House should be paid off by the time he is in college. Also, he will likely get a little extra from grandparents family that might give a little around Christmas, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, I was thinking about putting $12k right now from our savings into his tax advantage account rather than $100/mo.  I am thinking this makes more sense but wanted to see any negatives of doing this.  I ran a calculator and this probably wouldn't equal the full amount of the $100/mo, but its all I am comfortable contributing now.  Can always add more in later in life when hes out of day care and stuff.  One disadvantage would be if he isn't the college type, but I don't think thats a concern since we'd be contributing now  monthly and probably wouldn't know that for many years.  I should be able to free up this money with fairly minimal tax considerations right now so that isn't a huge concern.  Any other reason not to do the lump some or other considerations I should take in account.

&amp;#x200B;

Kind of related but not really.  Any concern that if our country went more to the ""socialist"" side of things and made college free of what would happen to these accounts? (not trying to make this political, so lets not. I'm pretty moderate myself).  Just what do people would think would happen to 529 accounts if we did move towards a system where college was free and paid through tax payers?

personalfinance,Should I continue to pay off auto loan with terrible interest rate or attempt to refinance or sell the vehicle? Help!,"So I am completely aware that I made a mistake to purchase a new car with absurdly high interest rates when I was in no financial position to afford it, and now I am in this mess. I've already beat myself up about how it was such a dumb and emotional decision months ago so now I am ready to do what I can do get rid of this stupid debt. I would just like some advice on what is the best way to proceed from you all:

&amp;#x200B;

I financed a new car for about $24k, monthly payment is $471 and interest rate is 11.7% (ridiculous, I know) in July 2018. I can make anywhere from $20k to $30k yearly at my job depending on bonuses and overtime (believe me, I'm picking up crazy hours as we speak). I live at home since I am a student and I have no other monthly expenses other than food. I've been making more than the minimum payment each month (anywhere from $500 to $2200). I currently owe around $17.5k. When I bought the car my credit was 625 and I had 4400 in credit card debt. (my credit limit was 4400 i.e. my cards were all maxed out) Since then, I've paid off all my credit card debt and my score has gone up.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to try and pay off the car by December 2019, which I know is a lofty goal. I would like to know should I keep throwing as much money at it as I currently am, or should I try to refinance? My credit score now is 720 but I realized have two medical bills in collections (due to an insurance company error which I plan to dispute). Should I try to refinance the car with these collections accounts or attempt to pay off the collections first then refinance (which may take a few months due to the dispute process). 

&amp;#x200B;

Or would selling it be a wise option? I was in an accident with the car back in September so I know that will affect what the car is worth. I've also already put over 11,000 miles on the car in the last 7 months due to my long commute to work. I have a feeling I am likely underwater with the car as a result of both those factors, so I'm not sure if this would be a viable option. I know I would have to cover the difference in the car's value at the time of sale and what I owe my lender while still needing to purchase another used car anyway since I still need one to commute to work and school. Then again, my knowledge is limited so if you have any reason as to why this may be a good idea I would love to know!

&amp;#x200B;

I want to thank you for taking the time to hear my story. I know I've made terrible decisions and I am currently on a journey to eliminate all of my debts and never be in this situation again. I would appreciate any constructive advice, thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Questions,"I have around $10,000 left in student loans spread across four different loans with varying interest rates. It’s been almost four years since I graduated and it really feels like I haven’t made much of a dent and I’m not sure what to do. My loans are as follows:

Loans 1-3:

Principal left: $2,134.40 
Interest rate: 3.61%

Principal left: $824.71
Interest rate: 3.61%

Principal left: $4,241.36
Interest rate: 4.41%

These 3 loans are under Nelnet, and I pay $100.29 monthly that gets split between the 3 of them. After interest, not a lot of money seems to be going to the actual principal. 

Loan 4:
Perkins Loan
Principal left: $2,694.99
Interest rate: 5%

This one gets paid quarterly for some reason, and is $120 each time. 

I’m not really sure what to do. I would like to consolidate them all into one loan with one interest rate as that seems the easiest option and the easiest to keep track of. My bank offers personal loans with APR’s ranging from 6.74% (12 months to pay back) to 7.25% (60 months to pay back). They also offer a consolidated student loan that is variable rate and says “Take approximately 180 months to repay”. 

I really only feel comfortable paying $150 a month if they all do get consolidated. I really don’t know a lot about this and so I have no idea where to go from here.",finance

I'm not here to tell people what to do with their money. This post is reviewed and okayed by my friend. He also wants to learn, he just doesn't use Reddit.

Hi, my friend has been looking into investing a large sum of his money into an index fund, but when he set up his account he wasn't really sure what he was doing so he chose all bonds under the impression that bonds meant safe.

That seemed alarming to me because for one, that's a lot of eggs in one basket, and for another, interest rates are more likely to go up instead of down. He's now seeing some depreciation, so he asked me what to do, and while I know what I would do, I feel too inexperienced to tell him what to do. So I said I'd ask here, where people have been great in giving advice and perspective while leaving the decision up to OP.

He
- has emergency fund put aside
- has started and funded a Roth IRA, split between total US, Int'l, and US bonds (I helped set this up).
- has a 403b (doesn't plan to put any more money in 403b since company already offers to contribute x% of paycheck)

If I were him...

-  I would cut my losses since he's concerned about being down $200 on a $30k account, and interest rates seem more like they'd go up instead of down. For the safest option I'd put that money in a high interest savings account like Ally or CIT or a CD account.
- I would personally start an HSA account if my workplace offered it.
- I would consider maxing out the 403b but he's worried about large costs and having money tied up in retirement. To do so, I would set contributions to max out and use current savings to make up the difference if it exists.

I know he doesn't have any large purchases but is very insecure of not having immediate cash available (hence why he had up to $60k sitting in a checkings account at one point on a $50k/year salary).

In conclusion, he's got $30k sitting all in bonds, he's worried about depreciation of those bonds, but he also wants to be safe and let his money grow more than inflation. What would you guys do, for reference?",finance

personalfinance,Financially smart to sell house?,"SO and I are in the process of deciding to sell our house and upgrade or stick it out.  The main reason is size (we're adding a 2nd baby soon) but trying to figure out if it is the right financial decision.  Currently in our first house and we lack a lot of knowledge on what financial impact we'd be looking at should we decide to sell.  Any thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Current house:

* Purchased in Los Angeles, mid 2015
* 3bed/2bath, \~1600 sq/ft 
* Purchase price: \~$940k w/ 20% down
* Remaining mortgage: \~$680k @ 3.5%
* Current price: likely around $1.15m, could get lucky and get above $1.2m if a lot lines up

&amp;#x200B;

Ideal next house:

* Still in Los Angeles - similar area ideally to keep us centrally located within the city 
* Larger square footage, even if still 3/2 but more bedrooms are better
* Target price: \~$1.4-1.5m

&amp;#x200B;

When we purchased, LA was a HOT market.  We went through many, many rounds of above asking offers until we finally got our current house.  The market has certainly cooled but we feel we can sell above our original price.  Whether or not we can find (and get) our next goal home is a tougher question.  And is it the smart financial move is even harder. 

&amp;#x200B;

Between my SO and I, we currently make \~$360k/year plus bonuses (which is up quite a bit from when we made the original purchase).  Not sure how confident I feel we'll remain at that level but (in theory) \~$210k of that is about to be locked into a 3 year contract with scheduled raises and bonuses.  The remaining \~$150k is potentially less stable, just based on the industry, but hopefully should remain fairly consistent.  There's also a strong chance between the two of us we'll add about $50k+ combined salary in the next 2 months based on raises and the potential contract.  

&amp;#x200B;

We're about to have kid #2 so space is a big factor though we can make our current house work if needed.  Outside space is more important, and we're lacking that a bit too!  

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of the mortgage, we have no debt.  We max out both 401ks each year and contribute \~$25k+/- a year to various other savings/investments.  We also are sitting on more cash than we should be (maybe $100k or more cash between various savings accounts like Barclays @ 2.2%...  or BoA at MUCH worse but get the platinum benefits which we use).

&amp;#x200B;

We also pay a monthly curtailment towards our mortgage - typically an additional $500.  If we got the higher mortgage (at the now higher interest rate), I feel we would likely forgo this curtailment towards principle for the foreseeable future. 

&amp;#x200B;

All that said - is there a rule of thumb we should be looking at?  Does selling this house @ less than 4 years in make sense or would we be throwing away more money on top of what was a pricey sell?  Is the smart move stick it out in current house a few more years and continue to pay down the mortgage at the low interest rate?  We could probably survive another 2-3 years in this house, but that could be a stretch.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the ramble - a lot we're trying to consider!!  Thanks!

personalfinance,Off-campus housing options for college and how to pay for them,"Hello everyone! I'm currently a sophomore in college, currently living with my parents and commuting roughly 2 hours round trip to class every day. I did community college for a year before transferring to the college I'm at now, so I don't owe any money in student loans from last year. This year, I took out about $8,000 in federal student loans to cover tuition and the left over refund check I use to cover my transportation expenses. 

Being a commuter and living with my parents has largely been a negative effect on my college experience. I'm not just saying that because I need to get away from my parents, but it's also negatively affected my grades(unable to attend study sessions due to commute, too many distractions at home, etc.). Add this to the fact that it's nearly impossible to have a social life at a college that's an hour away from me, and I feel like I need to move out next semester, Fall 2019. 

I intended to move out before this year, but I didn't plan anything properly wouldn't have had enough money. This year, I want to set myself up to actually be able to move out. Currently, I only have enough money saved up to get me through the rest of this semester. After tuition costs, I had about $4,000 which was an extra federal loan that I received due to my Parent-Plus denial. 

I'm planning on getting a job this Summer, which should allow me to save up about $4,000(perhaps a little bit more, but I'll estimate low). I would be okay with taking out more federal loans if possible, but I don't know how much more they'll lend me and I wouldn't know how to do that. 

I'm open to all suggestions(I know I should try to get a job now, I'll consider that but I'd like that to be a last resort since it would likely interfere with college). Thank you for any advice/suggestions.

First of all, I paid December's credit card balance in full, not just the minimum. Second of all, my due date for paying for the month of January is in a few days.

investing,The trouble in Europe has only begun,"MacroVoices probably my favorite podcast has an amazing interview with grant Williams.

This was on social risk; ie political extremeism. From the description: Erik asks Grant if we in a cyclical bear market and where he feels treasury bond yields are headed next. They discuss tensions between China and Taiwan, the rise of global populism and the future of France and Europe. Grant shares his update on how things are developing on Australian Real Estate and the risks of a recession. They end with touching on gold and the U.S. dollar.

Excerpt 

&gt;Erik: The other big one is bond yields.

&gt;We had so many smart people, whether it was Jeff Gundlach – our mutual friend Julian Brigden had told us, look, if you see a break of that 100-month moving average on the 30-year Treasury bond, that’s a trend that’s been in play since the mid-1980s. It’s a major signal. Sure enough, we got that signal.

&gt;A lot of people were saying it’s the break above 3.12% or so on the 10-year. We got that signal. And so many people said, once you see that break, there’s no turning back. You’re never going to see Treasury yields this low again for 30 or 40 years.
And, of course, it took 30 or 40 days before we hit, seeing a reversal of that. And, as we’re speaking – what now is a week ago for our listeners – we’re back in between that 2.60% and 2.80% range again, sort of chomping around here.

&gt;Where do you think we’re headed? Are Lacy Hunt and Raoul Pal about to be proven right that maybe we really are headed below that 1.34%, which, so far, has been the low yield on the 10-year? Or is this just a temporary pullback before Gundlach and Brigden and others are proven right?

&gt;Grant: This is the really interesting thing to me. This, to me, is where – when people say where is all the damage that’s been done by the last 10 years of monetary policy? And this, to me, is exactly where you’re going to figure out what’s happened.
The short answer is I think they’re both right. And I think, in a normally functioning market, I think Jeff and Julian and the guys that are calling for inflationary pressures and higher yields are absolutely correct.",finance
personalfinance,Do I even need to file state tax?,"I lived in two states in 2018. Worked and earned all of my income in the first state (same state I filed last year because I lived there all year).

Moved in June, and didn't earn a single penny in the new state that I currently legally reside in.

Turbo Tax says I don't qualify for the free filling because of something in my federal return. NBD, sure. However, that means I also need to pay for state. Okay also NBD except I had to file both states even though I earned literally absolutely nothing in the second (current) one.

Can I just not file the second one somehow? I can't find any way to avoid the second state so I don't have to pay a second (third) filing fee for $0.00 income.",finance
personalfinance,"I keep reading about municipal and other federal bonds giving 3%. If so, any particular reason to not invest in them instead of 2.1% from various banks","I was just looking at bonds ETF  like Federal Muni tax free bond, and the consensus is guaranteed returns of atleast 3% if bought now for a 5 year term,
So if you do not need the money within the next 5 years why not go with them. 

Stock market is okay, but recessions can ride out longer than 5 years if you buy near the top.

So for parking money are these bonds a better idea if you are okay with lower returns.

What are the various popular bonds I should look at. I did google, and most sites are from people who have a vested interest.

SO would like some insight from community here. Not familiar with USA bond market as a recent transplant.",finance
personalfinance,[DEBT] Is it a good idea to get a personal loan to consolidate?,"Right now I have about $7,000 on a credit card (from when I was unemployed..), one student loan of $4500 with an interest rate of 6.67%, and another student loan that's in freakin collections that's around $6,600. 

I finally have a good paying job again, and my credit is actually pretty good all things considered. It's around 740 and I'm at 9% utilization at the moment (the credit card isn't in my name, which is another reason I want to pay it off). 

I was wondering what the best option for doing that is? Should I get some kind of personal loan, lump all of it in there and pay that? I could easily put $1500-2000 toward it every month and pay it off pretty quick.. Just wanted to see if there are any better options.

I want that student loan OUT OF COLLECTIONS COMPLETELY. Those fucks screwed me over (long story) and I don't want them anywhere near it.

TL;DR: Around $18,500 in debt, want to consolidate. Wat do?",finance

personalfinance,Loans for Graduate School,"I will be applying to graduate school in the Fall of this year. Something that I really want to do in my life is a Masters in Europe. The issue is I will have no way to pay for it.

&amp;#x200B;

The estimated cost of living $800 per month, so for the two year Masters I am applying for that is $9600 a year, and $19,200 for the total two years I would be there. The actual tuition is amazingly cheap, $350 a semester, so $1400 for the total Masters tuition. So I am looking at a loan of about $20,600; I am guessing it will probably be a private loan. My idea is to get an on-campus job that (according to the university) pay about $400 a month so half of what I would need per month and use that to pay off the interest my loans whilst in school. (Maybe it would be better to just borrow half of what I need? To be honest, I haven't ran the numbers precisely, I just wanted to get an opinion from the outset as I look into this more closely.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I will have $30k in student loan debt finishing undergraduate. These are federal loans, subsidized and unsubsidized with an average interest rate of 4.42%.  I plan on doing a PhD after this as well in the states, assuming I'm accepted into one those are usually fully-funded (for math). Which the longest usually last about 6 years (.....6 interest accruing years).

&amp;#x200B;

I know that a large part of the judgement of this decision comes from what my salary will be after all this schooling, which is where things get most complicated for me. The academic job market is horrendous. Most people who try to land an academic job will move around the States for a couple year with $20k adjunct positions until they land a permanent position, which is if you're really really lucky. Now if I go to industry, I think it's fair to assume a 60k starting salary. (I guess the choice between these two paths is really the deciding factor, right? It seems completely crazy to do this to then have a $20k job for about 4 years while hunting for a permanent position). 

&amp;#x200B;

Writing this out, I feel crazy even considering it, haha. But some last notes, parent-help is not an option and I will obviously apply far and wide to as many scholarships as possible, but I am considering what I would do in a worst-case scenario. Thirdly, and I think most importantly, my reason for entertaining this seemingly crazy idea (financially) is that it is seriously something that would bring me a lot of joy in life, that is the value of this is more than $20k+interest for me. I don't have plans for a family or big house, nice cars or anything of that sort, it's not where I derive happiness in life; it is from academics. I understand I will have to live frugally for quite a bit after my PhD because of the interest that will have accrued on my undergraduate and masters loans which isn't a very scary thought to me, as long as I can eat and pay rent, I'm cool with it, it's how I live now and I'm very happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

So any thoughts or opinions, am I being to naïve and not fully considering the amount of debt I will be in after all of this? I would love any such comments, thoughts, things to watch out for, and definitely criticisms.

personalfinance,Optum Bank closed my HSA bank account without notice or my permission,"Optum Bank just closed my HSA account without notice or my permission to do so.

I just started working for a new employer this past November. I signed up for a HDHP plan and a HSA account. I've been making bi-weekly HSA pre-fica contributions through payroll. I've not done any transactions on the accounts, no withdrawals or other activity. It's current balance is over $4k. It's just my name on the account. It's going to be a huge headache as payroll is about to hit again this week. We can't pick our own HSA custodians and are forced to use Optum if we want pre-fica payroll deductions.

Optum Bank just minutes ago closed my account without any warning. I just got an email. To be sure it wasn't a spoofed email I tried logging into their system and I don't have a login anymore. My account is definitely gone. 

I've been on hold for them for 30+ minutes so far, haven't spoken to a person yet about what's going on. 

This is the email I got:
&gt; This is confirmation that your health savings account (HSA) with Optum Bank, Member FDIC, has been closed. If you requested a distribution or transfer, this was completed prior to the closure of the account.

&gt;Now that your account is closed you will receive any applicable tax documents by mail after the end of the tax year when your account was closed.
1099-SA tax form will be post-marked by January 31; this form is only sent to account holders who had distributions or excess contributions in the given tax year.
5498-SA tax form, which reports HSA contributions, is sent in mid-February.

I have no idea why they closed it. No fraud activity or suspicious activity on my account. I just checked my account two nights ago. I use a password manager with unique randomly generated very secure passwords and security questions on the account.

Think this is CFPB complaint worthy? I'm incredibly upset.",finance
personalfinance,Grad Student Looking to Tackle $6k CC Debt,"I've read a ton of different posts on here, most of which have all been super helpful! However, I wasn't able to find one catered specifically to my situation (where I don't have an income, and won't for the foreseeable future). 

Background:

* 24-year-old grad student, \~$6k of debt at \~23% APR (Venture)
* I quit my modest-paying paralegal job 3 weeks before starting law school. I didn't have a *ton* saved at the time and had to move during this period. First/last/deposit and other moving costs (furniture) and general costs of starting school added up and contributed to this debt. I had a temporary spending problem when heading into a big chapter of my life. I have completely stopped using the card, haven't increased my debt since (aside from school loans) and have never missed a payment
* I receive \~$10k per semester for living while in law school. I'm a first year (3 years total) on my second semester. There are no loans available in the summer unless you're taking classes (not typical/my plan)
* I might (*might*) get a paid internship this summer, it's entirely possible I'll have to do an unpaid externship
* Credit score = 720, been dropping from 770 over last year due to utilization ratio
* Rent = $1225 + \~$40 utilities (Seattle)

Option #1: Debt Consolidation CC

* I've seen this advertised a lot on this sub. I'm hesitant to take the hard inquiry hit by applying for one of the many recommended cards because I can't imagine them approving someone with no income 
* If I am approved, I find it hard to believe it would be for $6k

Option #2: Private Loan 

* I see this recommended much less, but still occasionally. I've been leaning towards this option more and more. 

Option #3: Wait...

* Keep paying high interest, hope to get paid this summer, live frugally and work as hard as possible to pay it down

Option #3(a): Sprinkle of Loans

* My school keeps a reserve of \~$3k for us as a ""reserve""
* This pot of FedPLUS loan doesn't accrue interest until the day you decide to pull it out, or you can elect to never pull it out. I've yet to touch it as I want to keep my loans as low as possible

personalfinance,Housing and interest rates,"So I’m looking at buying a house and after some estimation I’m seeing that I’d pay about USD 280,000 on interest over 30 years with a home loanof around $400k. If I continue renting, I’d pay about $250,000. So the way I see it, the rent is actually higher buying the home - if I were to just amass a ton of money through investments I’d save huge on the house in the long run, not to mention that I could leverage it for cash flow as a rental, rev mortgage, etc. 

Am I being stupid here? Everything online says that buying a house with 5% down is the best idea, but I can’t shake the feeling that a move like that is really best for the bank, not me. 

I really would like to learn more about this before I take on the risk of home ownership but all the “experts” have a clear motive to make money off of my misinformed decision!",finance
personalfinance,"Getting a disbursement from student loans, but I no longer need it.","So background: Freshman year of college I took out a $3000 student loan to pay for tuition. Living at home and commuting enabled me to pay for college the next 3 years until I decided I wanted to move out a year ago. Last year, I took out a single loan of 3500. This year, I took out a total of $20k, disbursed in 3 payments of about $6,700. My course schedule changed midway through fall semester (long story, not relevant), so I no longer need the 6,700 for this summer. I will need about 2k, of which i have in full in a 529 plan.

personalfinance,First real job after months of unemployment,"Hi guys,

I'm moving to Bethesda after a couple months of unemployment. Work starts on the 2/20. I've been ubering and charging a 0% card in the mean time. Here are the details:

58k/yr pre-tax with no relocation (would lower yearly amount)

Monthly payments:
* $1000 on Discover, 0% until March - $35 min payment
* $300 on Captial One, 22.99%
* $195 UAS Connect school loan every 4 months (asked to pay this next cycle, unable to make Feb payment) 
* $230 FedLoan every month
* $300 car and insurance, bought it  last year new at steep discount ('15 Diesel VW Golf). Owe $16k, worth about $9k. Prefer to keep this to visit family on weekends. 
* $???? Rent. Not sure what I should be looking for but I have a strong preference to living alone because of bad experience with dirty roomates and not being able to cook. Currently looking in Silver Spring but I don't have enough for a security deposit yet. I live 2.5 hours away. 

I currently have no savings left, emergency fund covered me until this month. Car was in the shop (under warranty) and cut into how much I could Uber this month. 

I have no experience living alone. My parents file my taxes and keep whatever comes back to pay for property tax (elderly and very low-income). Any advice would be appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Avoiding lifestyle creep after college - advice please?,"I'm starting post-college work soon and will be earning my first real salary, and I'm already catching myself thinking ""I'll be able to afford that"" about various things. My long-term goal is to build wealth and financial security (à la FIRE), but I am also pretty determined to live a ""good"" life along the way with certain luxuries that I never could afford before and didn't have while growing up. That said, I'm also very committed to being prudent and hope to apply the principles of FIRE aka r/financialindependence as I move into this new chapter. I have already had a lot of success with budgeting during college to not have to have paycheck-to-paycheck stress and have also had success with churning for credit card points and traveling on the cheap.

Just wondering if folks have any tips for how to manage spending on stuff that doesn't necessarily have long term value in the same way that saving/hoarding money can (for example, spending on small vacations, $500 for music festival weekend with a friend, buying for quality rather than price, etc etc). Basically, how to spend money on things that cost more up front when that means that a single purchase feels like a more significant choice than a bunch of little ones would be. Is it as simple as meeting my savings goal and spending the rest worry-free, or is there more to it than that? Also, is it OK to adjust savings down at any time or to pay back my loans more slowly if it means saving towards something else or having a nicer thing? 

Here is a rough breakdown of my pay and expected expenses (annual salary is 50k EUR gross so ~ 57.5k USD):

salary: ~3200USD/month net (this is after taxes and mandatory health insurance/state pension amount; the job is in Germany)

relocation: 2300 for this move (job starts in March, I'm moving from the US)

rent: 800/month (this is for a one- or two-bedroom apartment in my city, could be a little higher or a little lower. If 2-bed the second room would primarily be a studio space but I could also rent it out long-term or on AirBnB)

utilities: 100 

phone: 40

groceries: 250

eating out: 150 (I see this more as a fact of life than an indulgence so categorize it under living expenses rather than fun money)

public transportation: 100

rental insurance: 15

other/miscellaneous: 150

LIVING COSTS: ~1600/month


vacation fund: 150/month

fun money: 100

sauna/spa: 50 (cheap in my city, this is two day-long visits so 2x/month)

FUN MONEY: 300/month


Student loans payment: 250/month (I owe just under 22000 @ 4%, all are federal loans in deferment until August)

Credit card: 500 (I owe 6000 @ 0% interest - hoping to pay it off fast once I start work)

Savings: 500 (will increase to 1000/mo after pay off credit card, hope to save 10k E-fund...then what?) 


I am going into all this with a few thousand dollars I have previously saved up plus graduation gifts. My medium-term goal after the E-fund is to save up and buy an apartment in this city in the next two or three years (or at least saving as if I planned to make a down payment). I think that's my preference to paying off my student loans faster (for now). I have read many posts about the pros and cons of renting vs owning so not looking for much feedback about that, I would of course would do even more research into this before making such a purchase.

Just wondering how this sounds to everyone and, again, what strategies you use for managing ""luxury taste"". This feels especially important given that I am young and new to the working world, and that the habits I start now will probably follow me in the future. It's generally hard for me to tell myself that I shouldn't have/do something nice because I'm so young. Rather being young inspires me to find a way to do it practically (i.e. churning to travel). That's been my experience so far but I also haven't had real money so I have had to make it work. I grew up with very little money and lots of financial insecurity so just trying to get this all right and not repeat the mistakes I saw... Anyways thanks for your feedback!",finance

My parents won’t help me out at all because they think it’s a bad idea for me to have a credit card. I don’t want to make reckless decisions, I just want to build a credit score so I can get a car loan. Someday. Maybe.

I only have about a fifth of my savings in stocks, the rest is in a rewards savings account. Very casual, very low key. I use the Robinhood app. Is this a terrible idea for me? Should I put my money somewhere else? I have no short term need for large amounts of expendable cash. I plan on building up savings for a larger purchase in the future, I.e. a car.

personalfinance,Not enough taxes being withheld. How best to process for future years?,"As the title says, not enough taxes are being withheld from some of my paychecks and I'm looking for some guidance on how to proceed.  I am a musician and don't exactly have a simple tax return but do it through turbotax every year.  So far for 2018, I've input the info from ten different W2s (Box 1 wages varying from $300 to $20,000), five 1099s, and income from countless gigs less than $600 with no paperwork.

For some of the smaller W2s, no state and/or income tax has been withheld.  This is likely because of claiming 1 allowance, but over the last two years I've been updating to zero allowances everywhere I have worked (except the big ones).  Yet the problem has persisted.  Some examples:

W2 #1 $300 in wages but no state or fed tax withheld

W2 #2 $543.90 in wages, $42 fed withheld, $3.81 state withheld

For another recurring gig, I asked to be changed to zero allowances and was told that it wouldn't fix the problem and I don't make enough to have state taxes withheld.  I believe this is incorrect.  I made just shy of 2k from this gig in 2018.

As we know, S = ( Z + privKey \* R) / sk . As privKey, R and sk are the same in both examples, a different Z should result in a different S. Does someone knows how these transactions got the same S?

I can only think of sk not being the same for both transactions, which means their public keys are symmetrical (as R is the same). This is improbable by itself, but resulting in the same S is even less probable.

personalfinance,Am I entitled to the standard mileage deduction?,"On mobile, yadda yadda; apologies for the wall of text

Tax question: For the majority of last year I drove for Uber and Lyft full time, earning about $19k plus an additional $4k at other ""normal"" jobs; so my total gross income was just under $24k. Well I recently filed my taxes (early I know, type A personality) and my gross income after deductions is unbelievably low; only $3k. This is largely due to me claiming the federal standard mileage deduction of $0.45/mile. Having driven full time my total mileage was around 37k miles so my total deduction was $20k. That means, according to the IRS anyways, I took a $1200 loss rideshare driving. Of course this isn't really true because in reality it only costs me about $0.10/mile to operate my vehicle; all gas, maintenance, and insurance costs included. So was I right to claim this deduction? I was actually smart enough to set money aside each week in anticipation of owing taxes, but not only did I not owe the $2500 I thought I would, I'm actually getting an $800 refund. So I also wanna know what my chances of getting audited are? Thanks in advance for your advice at let me know if this fits better in another sub.",finance

personalfinance,Withdrew 401k when I quit my job in Nov 2017,"Long story short, I got fed up with the job I was working for 3 years at the time and quit in Nov 2017. I had about 8200 in my 401k but was forced to withdraw it because 1) I didn't have a job and 2) my POS ex-fiance wasn't going to pay for anything and it was the only way to keep paying my mortgage and basic bills. I quit Nov 3, 2017, and immediately started the process to withdraw it. Now, I am 95% sure it was deposited before the new year (2018) but I received a statement for 2018 taxes, and it says:  


Gross distribution: 7470.03  
Taxable amount: 0.00

personalfinance,Looking to apply for a new credit card before our trip to Europe,"Hi all,

My wife and I are going to Croatia and Slovenia this spring, and I'd like to capitalize on the trip by opening a new credit card.  We pay off our balances every month, and since I'm going to be booking a bunch of hotels anyway, I'd like to throw the expenses on a new card.  My credit score is around a 780.

What I currently have:

- Chase Sapphire Preferred - I didn't do enough research when I got this, and should have gone with the Chase Sapphire Reserved.  I'm actually using the bonus points from when I opened this card for our last trip to book the flights for this upcoming trip.

- AMEX Zync - this card is trash.  I've had it since college 10+ years ago though.  I could upgrade this to a gold card, but I believe you miss out on the bonuses by upgrading.  It has a $25 annual fee, and I wish I could get rid of it and go for something else, but I think my score would take a hit by closing it.  Although, my parents put me on their AmEx to build credit when I went away to college, so I wonder if my credit considers this card, or their accounts when it looks at my credit history.  I thought that I could possibly open up something like the Blue Cash Preferred card to keep my AmEx history alive, and then close the Zync card.

- Discover IT - use this for random purchases here and there.

- Bank of America Travel Rewards - used this card for the bonus points a few years ago.

- CapitalOne Quicksilver - use for random purchases.

I was looking into the PenFed Pathfinder AmEx card.  There's no annual fee, it has 4x travel points, 25k bonus points, no foreign transaction fee, and stuff I missed out on by going CSP instead of CSR like a $100 credit for TSA Precheck Application fee.  Is this a no brainer that I should go for this card?

We also don't fly too often (like once every 2 years), but we do travel (driving, gas) and use AirBnb.

Any other recommendations?",finance

personalfinance,Invest or contribute to student loan debt?,"I’m 24 and planning on getting started in investing using my tax return. I see a lot of advice on here going against this idea for people my age with student loan debt to invest. I have WELL above average student loan debt (I owe &gt;$100k, if they were smaller I’d probably favor putting extra money here, but unless I win the lottery these aren’t going anywhere for the next 9 years). Of all my loans, the average interest rate is about 5.5%. Using a tool like m1 finance and assuming a return of ~7% would be a profit. 

I understand my student loans are MUCH larger than what I’d be investing, but that doesn’t matter. I’d only be saving myself from the interest of 5.5% of $1000 or whatever I contribute to it, instead of earning a profit of ~1.5% on putting extra money into the stock market. 

Is it just the assumption of a positive return is not acceptable to make here and people are just valuing the guarantee of the extra value of money towards that debt would be a guaranteed x.xx% interest deduction and money saved higher. Or is there another aspect I’m over looking or just wrong about? Any advice or corrections is greatly appreciated!",finance

First of all, not sure if in correct subreddit but I think so. I'm a student working as a co-op in a branch of the federal government of Canada. My co-op term started on January 2nd and will end on April 26th. I was told that getting my first paycheck would take at most a month but it's been a bit more than a month now. I still haven't been paid and it's really annoying especially since as a result, I had to up my line of credit at the bank in order to pay my credit card, which I could've done had I been paid. Furthermore, I'm lucky to have decided to live home even though I have to commute 2 hours to work but my friend who started the same day as I started, still hasn't been paid and she has to pay rent. This pay delay is really annoying both of us and in my case, it's even worsening my credit score since I had to up my line of credit. Probab;y somebody would comment why I haven't borrowed money from my parents or a relative in order to pay my credit card instead of the bank as this was the only payment I had to do but my parents/relative have their own financial obligations and I don't want to be even more of a strain as I'm already living at home, not paying for rent. I've been limiting my expenses to almost nothing but the small amount of money I received for Christmas which was put in my savings account is almost gone. I think for the future I'll make an emergency savings account in case something like this happens again but right now I'm really in a bind financially and I'm not sure what to do.

CryptoCurrency,How Fractional Reserves work and why cryptocurrency will not stop this from occuring,"It's come to my attention that some users are confused about fractional reserves and how banks function. Let me explain.

Here is the Wikipedia page for it if you want to read for yourself: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking

The basic premise is that a bank has to keep a fraction of their liabilities on hand at all times. A liability is simply that the bank owes someone money. 

Any money deposited into a bank is a liability.

So if I deposit 100k into a bank, with fractional reserves that bank is allowed to loan out 90k of that money if the fractional reserve ratio set by the fed is 0.1

Now, let's say I get a loan from another bank of 100k and I deposit that loan into the bank. The bank's liability is now 200k, and they are free to loan 180k.

Now that 180k is loaned out to a consumer, and that money is loaned out by another bank. Let's say 120k of the original loan got back to me and the original bank, they can loan out 108k of that bank.

And so forth.

The fractional reserve idea does not create the money, it's the loan itself that creates the money.

Because we as users of our money are allowed to loan it out, we will create this effect. And without regulation, we can go deeper than 0.1 fractional reserve that is regulated by the fed.

There are a lot of reasons to use Bitcoin. Saving yourself from fractional reserves isn't one of them.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Counting on Student Loan Forgiveness,"My wife has about $260,000 in student loan debt from law school five years ago (original principal was about 200k). Based on her income, she has qualified for the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) repayment plan since graduating and we expect that she will continue to qualify for the forseeable future.

PAYE also offers loan forgiveness after twenty years of payments, which we are planning on taking advantage of. We have been working to pay off all other debts and saving meaningfully for our retirement over the past few years - we each max out our 401k, contribute to an IRA, and also manage to save something extra in taxed accounts too. But it feels uncomfortable having this $260,000 debt hanging over our heads, increasing every month since the PAYE payment doesn't come close to covering the interest.

Are our priorities correct here? Other than this loan and our mortgage, we are debt-free and putting our money in the correct places in the correct order as per this sub's recommendations I think.

And are there any other gotchas we need to look out for? As far as I can tell we just need to make sure that we don't miss a payment, and our income doesn't push us out of qualifying for IBR. Since this is calculated from the remaining amount and the previous year's income, and the principle isn't reducing, I think we just have to watch out for any pay rises that could bump us out, which is unlikely given the increase that would be required.

Lastly, we have to plan for the forgiven amount being taxable, which we will need to save for. Since we are not covering the interest, the amount forgiven could be as high as 350k. Those are the kind of numbers that make me doubt our plans and think about redirecting all of our retirement savings into clearing the student debt.

We are terrified of saving hard for retirement for the next 15 years only to have messed up and being hit with a vast bill that we would have paid off earlier instead of saving for retirement since the interest rate is quite high.

Is anyone else here counting on student loan forgiveness as part of their personal finance plans?

Edit -

To make this simpler, assume we have 260k available today. Is it more financially astute to pay off a debt that can be forgiven, or invest it. I’m leaning towards the latter if the math supports it since most of the counter arguments are about more intangible emotional aspects such as the feeling of being debt free etc, plus the risk associated with earning too much or the program being cancelled without grandfathering us in. I consider both of these unlikely but not impossible.",finance

So I ‘deployed’ during the summer of 2018 to Eastern Europe with the US Army. 

Prior to leaving, I submitted my deployment orders with my bank, a small credit union, and requested my credit card rate be lowered in accordance with the Service Members Civil Relief Act, so my interest would go would 11.5% to 6% on all charges to my credit card prior to deploying. The amount on my credit card was somewhere around $2500.

ethereum,Trade-Offs with Federated Byzantine Agreement protocols (i.e. Stellar)?,"So far most other blockchains that claim to be scaleable sacrifice decentralization to do so (i.e. EOS). EOS has been written to death and I can easily google the trade-offs of DPoS vs. PoW vs. PoS.

However what I can't seem to find is a good article that articulates the trade-offs made when using FBA (i.e stellar) vs.all the others. All I find are comments from the stellar reddit claiming that it is both more decentralized, scaleable and secure when compared to bitcoin and ethereum. This is because, they claim, that FBA allows nodes to select which validators they trust and create ""quorums"".

Now i'm always a skeptic, and I see how Ethereum developers are working on increasing scaleability while minimizing impact on decentralization and security.

personalfinance,Setting up W4 to get amount owed/refund as close to $0 as possible,"I am not a fan of giving the government an interest free loan and would like to avoid owing them money each year. A bit of back story: I moved to California from Maine over 5 years ago and my annual income has increased at lot over that time. Before moving to California, I was filing single and made about about $25k. Now I am married, filing jointly and have combined $150K. I mentioned this because last year for the first time at had to make an additional withholding. My question is how to avoid owing money at tax time. This year was better, but I still want to figure out how to fix it. Last year, I owed almost $3k in federal and got about $1k in state refund. This year I owed $1k, but my state has a refund of $1.3k, so that is a wash. However, I still want to bring both as close to zero as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few details about our W4's.

&amp;#x200B;

Myself:

* Income: \~$100k
* Federal Taxes
   * Filing Status: Married
   * Total Allowances: 0
   * Additional Withholding: $120.00 (was $100 but once I saw I owed again, I changed it.)
* California Taxes
   * Filing Status: Married dual income
   * Withholding Allowance: 0 
   * Additional Withholding: $0.00 (was $10 but once I saw a refund for state, I changed it down to $0)

Spouse:

* Income: \~$50k
* Federal Taxes
   * Filing Status: Married, but withhold as single. (read online that since I make much more than my wife, she should use this to withhold more taxes)
   * Total Allowances: 0
   * Additional Withholding: $0
* California Taxes
   * Filing Status: Married dual income
   * Withholding Allowance: 0 
   * Additional Withholding: $0.00 

I think I will increase my additional federal withholding and increase my State withholding allowance to 1. But would that be enough? I should also note that my income is going to increase again for 2019, by \~$30k and that we are expecting our first child this year. Is the child credit enough to balance things out?  Would it make sense to increase my 401K contribution to lower my AGI. We our comfortable with my take home pay, so I would like to keep that as close to it is now as possible.

personalfinance,Man vs Debt: Any advice would be great.,"Hey r/personalfinance. Long time lurker, first time poster looking for some advice on my situation.

* Wife and I are both 30. Married in 2018 with no kids.
* No savings ($56,000 401k)
* Income: Wife just started residency (\~$60,000/yr) &amp; my tech job (\~$120,000...2nd year in this range)
* Lived apart for 4 years while she was in medical school, and while she had student loans, it wasn't enough to cover everything. We paid 2 rents, utilities, etc.
* Lifestyle creep with my higher income, coupled with our wedding and honeymoon have put us in a bad spot. My wife also struggles with mental health issue (depression/anxiety), which I can tell you has increased expenses. Being apart during med school, in addition to work and class load put more of an importance on the time we spent together, so I often found us going  out to more dinners/movies/vacations in an effort to take her mind off of it all. I understand this wasn't the ideal way to go about it, but when I was in that situation, and failing out of medical school isn't an option for her, I did what I thought was best at the time.
   * I only bring this up, because I'm absolutely aware how reckless the spending was, and that it is not something that will continue.
* Her student loans are \~$180,000 and I still have \~$18,000 left from college that I slow played paying like dummy (also wasn't making much for a few years after graduation).
* Combined our CC debt is close to $55,000 with varying interest rates.
   * $14000, 18.24%
   * $1200, 13.99%
   * $15187, 25%
   * $10200, 18.24%
   * $10100, 18.24%
   * $3700, 16.15%
* I'm trying to work through all options: debt consolidation, using 401k to pay CC debt (yuck), personal loan.
   * Given that in 3-6 years, my wife's salary is going to jump significantly (low end $250,000) and I hope to still be at my current job, we would in a much better spot (curtail spending, debt decrease, rainy day fund, etc).
   * Would it be worth it to using 401K? I know that is highly frowned upon, and should not be used as a piggy bank, however, the thought of using it to pay down the CC debt does provide a sense of relief...which is part of why I'm reaching out so that I don't do something dimwitted. Should I reach out to debt consolidation services? Any advice would be great.
* I know this isn't everything, so if more info is need please ask.
* And yes, we do recognize why and how we are in this situation and have discussed these issues together.

Husband is currently in school, taking out loans. I have been paying my loans on time under income driven repayment plan (IBR) and the public service loan forgiveness (PSLF) My IBR was due for recertification which got denied due to combined incomes behind too high. 

Panicked I called Fed Loan Servicing who informed me my new payment was gonna be about $900. We were pay $432, which was a struggle (one of the highest cost of living places in the country, and poor financial choices from both of us years ago that we are almost done fixing). The woman I spoke to suggested we file “married but separately”, as we filed together last year and that will keep my monthly payments at about $400. But that we’ll have to file this way until I make my 120 payments towards PSLF. 

I’ve tried googling but I’m not getting any clear cut answers on what the repercussions are gonna be when we file separately. We got a nice mortgage return and a few other things. And with the new baby, his student loans, etc.

investing,Canada faces calls to ease stiff mortgage stress test,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-housing-mortgages/canada-faces-calls-to-ease-stiff-mortgage-stress-test-sources-idUSKCN1PT1WQ

&gt; TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada’s main financial regulator is coming under increasing pressure from banks and mortgage industry lobbyists to ease a stress test designed to cut out risky lending, but the regulator is expected to hold off on changing the rules, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

&gt; Proponents of a change say easing the terms of the test would alleviate a housing slowdown and stem the flow of borrowers being pushed toward loosely regulated private lenders but one source with direct knowledge of the matter said the regulator is reluctant to meddle with a test it introduced only 13 months ago. 

&gt; The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Canada’s main financial regulator, introduced rules last January requiring banks to test borrowers’ ability to repay mortgages at an interest rate 200 basis points above their contracted rate.

&gt; The stress test was part of a range of measures, known as B-20, designed to ensure banks maintained vigilant mortgage underwriting standards at a time of red-hot housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver. 

&gt; Banks had initially supported B-20 believing it would help housing markets achieve a “soft landing”, where prices stabilize, and lessen the risk of a housing bubble.

&gt; However, one senior banker, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said there was growing support for the test to be adjusted, possibly to 150 basis points, if interest rates keep rising. Money markets see about a 50 percent chance of another hike before year end.",finance

personalfinance,Where to get relatively big personal loans with bad credit?,"TLDR: need around $20k personal loan, but have low credit score (550-570 range) with some delinquent/derogatory marks. where to go?

Asking for someone I know. He drove into someone's car and caused around $20k damages, but he was uninsured at that time. Has asked the owner to pay in installment but understandably refused because he's living from paycheck and has barely extra. At this point getting any lender willing to give him the loan at any interest rate is prioritized. He has gone to a few local banks and CUs but always been turned down. The last one he tried was OneMain, but they could only give $4k and requires co-signer and a collateral. The thing is he doesn't have any family member willing to help and the only asset he has is his car that hasn't been paid off yet, so co-signer and collateral are pretty much out of question. 

Is there any known lenders who are willing to lend to someone like him?

investing,Adding Risk Assets in Current Market Environment,"Given the slow creep higher in interest rates, liquidity coming out of the market, broad corporate earnings being revised down and the prolonged nature of this current bull market (although at times it may have felt otherwise), where does the community shake out in terms of adding risk assets? Most asset allocation models I see still reflect a heavy US large-cap focus. Rightfully so, given growth over the past few years.

But if you were to ask yourselves where risk assets would be added (or not at all) in your portfolio, would you consider doing so/and where? 

One place I'm looking at is Emerging Markets. If you look at economic &amp; GDP projections to 2030, significant gains may be made be combining the human capital of countries like China, India, Brazil, South Africa and combining them with better education, technological gains and improved infrastructure; within ten-fifteen years, emerging market economies could be a significantly bigger composition of global markets. 

Given that EM has been such a volatile asset class over the past ten years, often finishing in the top quartile or bottom amongst different asset classes, can understand how its a tough sell to conservative investors. Many EM (and developed) countries have troublesome debt burdens, look no further than China, Greece, Japan, etc.

tldr: Long market run up (9 years+). Would you consider adding risk assets today? Is EM appealing?",finance

With the tax credits, it seems like you are essentially building more home equity in the form of the panels very quickly with the tax credits, am I thinking about this incorrectly?  I understand that you are also taking out additional debt as well.

(Crosspost from r/realestateinvesting)","I am potentially relocating to a lower COL area for work and I'm now faced with the decision to continue to rent or to buy. I would be looking for a relatively low-priced house that needs rehab with the intention of living in it for a couple years and slowly refurbishing it to flip. It would be my first flip and I realize I need at least that much time to learn about the process. The problem is that I'm still carrying a lot of debt (about $40k) at mostly high interest rates. I also have no cash saved because I am constantly throwing whatever I have at the debt to bring it down.

I would utilize an FHA loan for the house and would have to also finance any closing costs. Basically, I'm in no position to buy a house. However, the rent in this new area is comparable to what I am currently paying, and my monthly payment would be much lower with the 30 yr mortgage payment Zillow is calculating. There is also a tenant already leasing the guest house of the property I'm interested in.

My initial plan is to buy the house with the relocation cost paid to me by the company, pay the mortgage on it and don't do any repairs until my other debts are paid off, and then start to rehab it. It is livable with what looks like the exception of kitchen appliances.

First off, I'm a Single guy in IL. According to my W2, I made ~$50700 (Box 1) in 2018 &amp; Federal Income withheld ~$3901 (Box 2). I paid about ~900 in student loan interest this year and besides contributing to my retirement plan, that's all I really had going on.

First question - Did I, as a single guy, take too many allowances (I elected 2 bc I vaguely remember an old friend saying that's what they elected) but it turns out I owe now while last year I remember getting about ~$400 back with around the same pay. Do I need to change that back to 1 allowance to minimize if I owe anything next year? 

Second question - how do I go about paying this in installments? I was paying off a car I had but it looks like I'll push to pay this off faster.

Over the next 4 months I'll earn approximately $40k. My plan is to pay off about $20-25k on my car then refi the rest for a lower interest rate and also pay off the existing $10k completely with the remaining money. I'll earn around $115-120k this year including the $40k over the next 4 months so I'd like to keep some of the car loan to help rebuild my credit.

BLUF: Is it harmful to pay off all debts within these 4 months? Or are there better courses of action to take?

Thank you all.",finance

personalfinance,How on earth do people get mortgages,"First time posting here, but thanks in advance because I love this subreddit and know someone out there is going to have some good advice for me.

So here is my situation. I am 23, fresh out of college and making really good money, and have about $10k saved up. I live in a really cheap housing market, and think I could find a starter home for somewhere between 50-100k. I know I can save up another 10k as I have no real expenses, clear a little over 2k biweekly after taxes, and my rent is $500 a month to live in a dump. I did this on purpose because I have dreams of financial independence pretty young, and think buying a home and fixing it up so I’m paying off my mortgage instead of putting my cash in someone else’s pocket would be a good start. However even with a 798 credit score and (what will be) 20% down and proof of income, it seems like no banks will even consider me! The 3 I have approached all wanted 5 sources of loan repayment with at least 2 year history (previous mortgage, car payment etc) and this is something I won’t have for a while. Is there any way to work around this even at a slightly higher interest rate? I thought getting an FHA loan was supposed to be easy?? Any advice is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Just Need Some Help (Investment Questions),"Morning!

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am between a few investment ideas and I was hoping to get some input. I already max my 401k, and I have about $1500 a month going into vanguard indexes. That said, I am also recently married, my wife has 250k in student loan debt (federal @7%). I currently have no outstanding loans outside of mortgages (Primary house, 2 rentals).

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently between 2 ideas. I am considering either going for another rental investment, or aggressively paying down her debt. The benefit of paying down the debt is that is a ""guaranteed"" 7% return on cash, and it will absolutely ease our future financial stress against our marriage (which is not bad, but during our discussions is always a pain point). The rental has a ton of upsides and tax advantages but a lot of unknowns and risks as well. The loan payment is currently $2900 a month, which is essentially her average take home. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other note: This is a pre-existing debt to our marriage. We discussed it before getting married and I absolutely knew about it going in. That said, I am not sure I am comfortable co-signing a refinance because then it officially becomes ""our"" debt. That said, I may end up going that route, if we can get say 5% vs 7% on the loan, that is a huge saving every year and to others peoples point in the past, I need to acknowledge it basically is our debt, even if it is not formally.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts? Thank you so much.

personalfinance,"Credit utilization involving loans, CC, etc","Hey all - my post is two fold. First inquiring about credit utilization and second being loan consolidation. 

- how do loans factor into credit utilization (let’s go with ‘CU’ to shorten my post lol). It’s said that having below a 30% CU ratio is best. So as a real life example - let’s say I have 2 credit cards with $5k limit each. So a total of $10k limit. So the optimal CU would be to use between $1k-$3k. But let’s say I have student loans of $27k and I’m about to get a car loan for $20k. I’m confused if I need to add them all up ($5k + $5k + $27k + $20k) as my available credit or how the loans are factored into the CU. *if you could use my example as a reference that would be awesome*. 

- let’s say I have 5 student loans for $27k total. The rates are different. When I do a weighted average of all the loans my rate is 4.2%. What does ‘consolidating’ my loans mean? I have a plan in tact to pay off more than the minimum payment so wouldn’t it just be beneficial to pay the minimum balances on the lower % interest rates and pay more aggressively to the higher interest rate loans?",finance
personalfinance,Super low tax refund (Always),"I've been at my job for 5 years now and I've never ever ever ever had a good tax refund. I keep hearing about people paying off their cars or going on trips etc, even ones who had the same job as me or were in a worse financial situation than me but I don't understand why mine is SO low.     


For numbers, my ""usual"" is $80 TOTAL state+federal refund. I haven't submit it yet, but right now I'm looking at $100 refund, which is a little higher but still SO low  


I'm using turbo tax (free tier), entering numbers straight from my W2 100% accurately.       
I'm single, no dependents, no health insurance all year.  


My income is $21,640.00    
Federal withheld: $1,065.00 (\~5%)     
State withheld: $1,341.69 (\~6.2%)     
Medicare withheld: $313.82 (\~1.45%)     


  
I work from a home-office 100% of the time (telecommute) and i have that deduction but turbo tax says to do the standard $12,000. Last year I got around $900 back because I listed a TON of work-related purchases. This year it didn't seem to help but I couldn't add very many things  


  
Does this sound normal? $100? I googled and it says the average is $1,800 but that's probably for people with dependents and HoH and such (which I don't qualify for)  


Any help is appreciated and I can answer any questions if needed",finance
personalfinance,"In the middle of a refinance and find out I'm inheriting 25,000","Hey everyone, I've followed this sub for a long time but never posted and I can only marginally consider myself an adult in that I own a house so please dont be offended if I'm asking dumb questions.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am in the middle of refinancing my home right now to cover some much needed repairs/updates. The house needs a new roof &amp; fascia and more importantly a new furnace/AC.....it died may of 2017 and I cant do another Utah summer with no cooling. We have already considered all our options and determined that this would be a somewhat responsible decision. We have 130k in equity and are borrowing 26k. We are getting in to a lower interest rate, and since we are going from an FHA to a conventional loan the lack of mortgage insurance offsets the increase in payment so that our payment is only 17 dollars more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then out of the blue I get a call informing me that I will be receiving a check for 25k from my grandfathers estate. My grandfather passed away 7 years ago so I had no idea this was coming or I would not have started the refinance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do have some student loan debt and a credit card, both totaling just under 17K. No other debt (other than the mortgage I guess). I have happily been chipping away at this for a little while and had no intentions of using a refi to pay off debt. I was planning to keep making payments and applying tax refunds until it was gone (should be next spring).

&amp;#x200B;

Should I stop the refi process (if possible at this point), use this inherited money to work on my house and continue paying off my debt as before OR should I consider myself lucky, continue with the refi to work on my house and use the inherited money to pay off debt now? OR should I stop the refi, use the inherited money to pay off debt and not fix the house?(my wife may murder me if we have to do another summer with no AC) OR do any of you have a better suggestion? 

&amp;#x200B;

OR should I just sell it all and head to the mountains to forget the troubles of the world and become a hermit?",finance

personalfinance,$7500 tax refund due to EV purchase. How do I invest this money?,"Background: I'm 25. I make ~83k a year. I invest 12% of my income to my 401k with ~6% match (401k not maxed, company match is maxed and then some). I have only contributed $2000 to my 2018 roth IRA so far. IRA total is roughly ~24k (~4k in traditional ira, rest in roth). I have roughly 10-12k in my savings account already (at 2.2%), plenty for &gt;6 months of expenses. No credit card debt (always paid in full, &gt;800 credit score). &lt;$2000 student loan at 3% but instead of paying it off, im putting a reasonable amt (~$250) towards the loan, and putting the rest into my IRA for better returns. 

I bought a tesla model 3, on a loan for 47k at 2.75%. i have about 45-46k left on the loan. I will get a federal tax credit of $7500 once I file my taxes.

I see three main options. Should I : 

* invest the tax credit to my roth IRA, and max my 2018 IRA / put $4000 towards 2019
* put that $7500 towards my car loan
* put it in my savings

i'm aware putting the money towards my auto loan won't lower my monthly payment, but it will get me a little closer to being loan free. However, I'm only 25 and I really like the idea of putting the money in my IRA and having that money compound and being one step closer to FIRE. Even though I haven't been maxing my retirement accounts, i still invest heavily in retirement when I can while still enjoying my 20s.",finance
personalfinance,Missing W2 from employer that no longer exists (PA/IL/US),"Long story short, I stopped working for my former employer in March 2018; it was a sole-proprietorship with a married couple. It was an LLC, but technically in ""name only"". It was headquartered in Illinois; I lived and worked at a retail store in PA.

They illegally withheld hours from paychecks and a bunch of other shady stuff, and I got the Pennsylvania Wage and Hour Division involved. Legal proceedings are coming up soon. The Wage and Hour Division, even though this was an LLC, is attempting to get criminal charges held against the two owners.

Now... I have yet to receive a W-2 for the three months I worked in 2018. I don't expect to receive a W-2. With the legal proceedings coming up, I'd prefer not to contact my former employer via personal e-mail asking for a W-2.

I do, however, have my last paycheck from my employer that features year-to-date withholding amounts for federal, state, local taxes, along with gross/net income listed.

So what should I do? Wait and call the IRS in about 10 days?",finance

I'm confused why for the last 2 years, we have wound up with jsut over $1,000 owed for federal taxes between my wife and I.  Our situation is this:  I make around $125k, but my wife only makes about $15k, we own a home, and have 1 child.  Married filing jointly.  We both have put 0 in our W4 - even though I understand you're supposed to put 1 in our situation, when we owed in 2018 I thought it we dropped down to 0 it would fix it.

I went to file this year, and as I'm putting in my own W2 the website is calculating my refund and at first it comes up with like $5000-7000 refund.  Awesome.  I add in my wife's W2 and the refund completely goes away, and we owe just over $1,000 for federal.

Are we doing something wrong?  Is it because there is such a disparity in our income levels?  Should I manually opt to pay more taxes from my checks?  

I dont know if there is enough information here to help, but I'm confused as to why we are owing money right now.",finance
personalfinance,"If I underpaid 2018 federal taxes, should I file / pay as soon as possible, or just use normal deadline?","Hi all, last year I had unexpected income that didn't get properly withheld taxes for, and I already know that I'm going to face an underpayment penalty.  I don't qualify for the 2 mitigating reasons (paying at least 90% of what's owed, or at least all of the previous year's amount).  This is my pure oversight and not being on top of it. 

My question asking your advice is: should I pay or file taxes as soon as possible now, or does it not matter at the point (regarding the amount of penalty) and I can just file / pay at the usual time? 

I ask because it's kind of hard to figure out from the tax forms, whether they're just calculating how much / how long I underpaid last year, or it includes into this calendar year's not having paid on time...

personalfinance,Lost job. Have pay day loans out,"I've been in a cycle of payday loans for a few months now using my paycheck to pay some off then getting more out to keep paying off other one.I know it's horrible and I was looking at ways to finally solve the solution but, today I got fired.  

I don't blame anyone but my self it was my own fault. Even if it did take Uber 31 minutes to get to my house when it usually takes three to five if you don't have a car you need to plan for things like that ans ive learned from that mistake.  

My question is I already filed my taxes and my federal return is 700 and I need that to live I chose direct deposit should I just close my bank account before the creditors take it off I went back on the website I filed on and it said on Friday I can make changes so I'm going to try to change it to a paper check but I don't know if it's too late.  

And should I still closed my account  honestly I feel it's better to owe these small private companies debt rather than a large Bank.

Also I can't file for unemployment since it was my own fault for being late correct?  I live in California.

I know I'm a horrible person but I'm just trying to survive here It was a minimum wage job and I'm already going to turn in to resumes today at other ones",finance
personalfinance,"Refinancing student loans, but don't want to mess up ability to get a mortgage. Any advice or perspective?","Hi all,

My wife and I were hoping to get some advice or resources on a finance decision. We started the process of refinancing my student loans. When we started there was an error on my credit score that dropped it significantly lower than my wife’s, so I thought it made sense to have her on as a co-signer. 

Fortunately, the error has been corrected and my score is now only about 40 points lower than hers, but now we’re wondering if we should restart the refinance process with only one of us (me) signing for the loans. We would like to get the lowest interest possible on this refinance, but we also don’t want to compromise our ability to qualify for a good mortgage rate in \~3 years. Below are some details:

**Annual Gross Income (Household) :** 

145,000

**Student Loans:** 

62,000 (Federal; 5.3% avg interest rate)

14,000 (Wells Fargo; 11% avg interest rate)

5,000 (Federal; \~4% interest rate; **not included in refinance**)

**Credit Scores:**

745 (me)

785 (wife)

**Refinance Terms:**

76,000 (15 years; \~4.5% interest rate)

**Other debts:**

No credit card debt, car loans, or other debts to speak of

**House Budget:**

Very roughly looking in a 200K-300K range

&amp;#x200B;

So our 2 main questions are: 

1. Would using my credit alone significantly compromise our ability to keep that 4.3% interest rate on the refinance?

2. If we were to use both of our credit scores, should we expect to have issues being approved for a good interest rate on a home loan in approximately 3 years?",finance

My husband and I both have worked in support for various Intuit software, so we're very familiar with how they work, but HRB is new territory for us.

personalfinance,To pay off student loan or keep $ in savings?,"I'm sorry if this is a super repetitive or simple situation but I can't for the life of me wrap my head around the math of interest rates. I would really appreciate any input from the r/personalfinance community.

I'm paying off a large student loan that has a remaining balance of $28,051.12 and a terrrrrrible current interest rate of 9.125% that just keeps rising. I currently pay this at $400 a month. I have a little over $30k in savings and am debating paying the loan off in full.

I understand that paying off the loan in full will save me money in the long run, but my main questions are:

* My savings account has in interest rate of 2.20%. Should I let my savings sit for a little longer to gain more interest before paying off the loan? Would that be helpful or hurtful?
* If I bite the bullet and just pay off the loan, how much $ will it save me in the long run? Is it worth it?
* Will it be more beneficial in the long run to pay it off soon and immediately starting rebuilding my savings? How long would it take to get back to a similar savings $ amount?

personalfinance,"[Savings] Deciding where to park your emergency fund, sign-up bonuses aren't just for credit cards!","TL;DR: The Ally application process in my situation on top of a $200 bonus to open a Capital One 360 Money Market Account made us move our e-fund from our credit union to Capital One instead of Ally. Might be worth checking out bank bonuses before you choose who you go with!


This started as a response to this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ane0f0/where_can_i_find_higher_interest_saving_accounts/ but it got so long I wanted to make it its own post. u/nw342, this is for you and anyone else that might be able to use the info.


There is some great advice on this sub-reddit, and a lot of people recommend Ally for high yield savings, but I wanted to share an anecdote of my experience moving my e-fund out of a .1% account into an online High-yield savings account in case any of it helps you or others:


We had recently built up about $10k in our e-fund, earning .1% at our credit union's savings account, when we decided we'd like to be earning more on that and delved into some research on where we should park it. Ally and Synchrony were the two contenders for me as they were the highest rates that had the most positive reviews, and we're pretty risk-adverse people so we wanted to go with a well-known place so we'd be the most comfortable. We ended up deciding on Ally in the end even though they had .05% less rate (1.85 vs 1.9 at the time of research), because they seemed to have the better reputation and were talked about a lot more than Synchrony on this sub-reddit. We went through the application process and got a 'We need to review your application and will contact you later'-type message after submitting. Apparently other people get approved immediately, but turns out the fact that my wife and I had different previous addresses within the last 2-3 years (we just got married and she recently moved out of her parents') flagged a review. 


When I got the call from Ally about a week later, they said they needed documentation that we lived at the address we submitted with our application, in the form of utility bills, rent, post office forwards, etc. No problem I thought, my name is on all that stuff, I'll send it right over. Annoyingly for an online bank, they wouldn't accept this electronically and needed a fax or to snail-mail the paperwork, I elected to fax. About 3 or so days later I get a call from Ally again asking to follow up on the application and that they needed the information I had just sent, apparently one department got the info, but wasn't shared with whomever was making the phone calls. When I told them I'd sent it already they said they'd get back to me at another time. I think it was probably the next day I got a call saying they received the documentation, but wasn't good enough to approve the application because my wife's name wasn't on the documentation and she was supposed to be a joint owner of the account. 


I was pretty frustrated at this point (it's a savings account, not a credit application!) and was ready to try and start the Synchrony application to see if it was any better. Around that time we got an offer from Capital One, that if we opened a Money Market Account with them and deposited at least $3k and left it for 3 months we'd get a $200 bonus. At the time they had savings rates of .85%, or 1.8% if your balance was &gt;= $10k. Doing the math, it'd take about 20 years for a 1.9% rate on $10k to outpace a 1.8% rate on $10.2k, so that was the obvious choice, especially because we could always move over to the higher rate if we really wanted to rate chase. Bonus was that my wife already had a credit card with Capital One so the application process was literally hitting an Apply Now button and filling out minimal information to have me as a joint owner, and we were approved immediately. Over time, as the fed rates increased all the online savings rates did too, and our Capital One 360 money market increased to 2% for balances over 10k before Ally's (albeit $0 minimum rate) moved to 2%, so we actually had a better rate in our situation for about a month or so, and then the same rate for another month or so. Of course it's a worse rate now that Ally’s $0 minimum rate is 2.2%, but with rates fluctuating and the difference now being .2% we figured it's not worth moving our money around so much and will probably revisit if the rates become really disparate. I’m not saying Ally is bad, or that it shouldn’t be the #1 recommend HYSA for 99% of people, but just wanted to point out a case where going a different direction could be beneficial. Depending on your savings situation, it might be worth looking into some other banks that offer a sign-up bonus instead of JUST the highest rate.


I like doctor of credit, as they have some great information, https://www.doctorofcredit.com/best-bank-account-bonuses/#Best_Saving_Account_Bonuses and they have a pretty comprehensive list of high yield savings account offerings as well. https://www.doctorofcredit.com/high-interest-savings-to-get 
I don’t personally like the idea of churning these bonuses as they recommend, and it does take a good deal of diligence and some potential effort to not screw up your financial situation as a word of warning to those interested in doing just that, make sure to read their disclaimers and follow the advice if you go down that road, but it is still a good resource of compiled information to make a good decision on who to go with even if you plan to stick with one account.",finance
personalfinance,"Finishing graduate school with $25k in CC Debt, seeking consolidation options?","The situation:

What I'm having trouble with is that my *current* income is $0 (since I'm going to school full-time), which makes it a hard sell to any loan provider. Is there any way I could leverage my future salary to secure better terms on a loan? I feel like I will be making enough to plug away at the student loans in a decent amount of time, and if need be the credit cards too, but paying the high interest on those really grinds me.

Thanks for any guidance.",finance
personalfinance,Am I overpaying on my student loans?,"The initial balance of my student loan was around $125,000 12 months ago. I consolidated my loans before I started to pay them back, the interest rate I got was 5.6%. Since then I have paid around $38,000 off, $13,000 of that was interest.

The interest I've paid is over 10% of the initial balance (13,000/125,000=10.4%), which is almost double the consolidated interest rate. 5.6% of $125,000 is $7,000. And that's the max amount, it should decrease as I am paying it off.

Am I missing something here, or am I overpaying? I tried calling FedLoan and didn't get much help.

personalfinance,Joint VS Separate filing,"For a portion of 2018 I was overpaying my federal taxes. Around July the correct taxes started to take effect. 

When I am doing my taxes if I file jointly we are only getting a $180 return, but when I do them separate my husband get $0 back and I would get $2600ish. Since we aren't itemizing it seems foolish for us to file jointly. The only thing I would loose is the interest I paid on student loans I have for my daughter, but that's only $40 I would get back.

Is filing separate returns wrong in my scenario, am I missing something?

personalfinance,Federal Gov Benefits (usa/retirement),"To make a long story short I'm about to accept a position with the va. (Veterans hospital).  Part of the benefit package that was explained to me is what's called a Basic Plan. Which is a kind of a pension


4.4% will be deducted from my paycheck each period.  When I retire I will get 1% of the average of my highest paid 3 years multiplied by the number of years I worked as a yearly pension.  I'm not even going into the fact that if I went to work for the feds in 2012 I would only have to pay 0.8% for the same benefit (I'm kind of salty about that, stupid Congress changing the rules....)


My quesion is as follows.  If I wasnt forced into giving that 4.4% into this program would I have been able to invest that money in traditional retirement vehicles and get the same or better return than this program?  Basically how good or bad of a deal is this?  If it was only 0.8% there wouldn't even be a question but 4.4% is significant enough to me.

personalfinance,Just traded a car and have a question,"I traded in my 2016 on a 2019 on the 1st for a lower interest rate and lower payments (but will still be paying what I have been so I can pay it off sooner). Told the dealer from start to finish (sales, sales manager, finance) that the payment on the old one was due on the 6th and they said not to worry about it because they'd be paying it off. 

Checked on that again yesterday when I dropped off the title to the old car and finance told me to check with the sales manager--that they should just make that payment since it was already included in the loan amount. Sales manager tells me to make that payment and ""the loan will sort itself out on the back end.""

I have a perfect payment record for all my credit-related stuff and have improved my credit score to 700 by following the advice here over the last year and a half or so--so what should I do here? Make the payment and hope it does ""sort itself out on the back end"" or give the dealer a week or so to make the payoff?

personalfinance,Building savings vs. paying off loans,"I was wondering what the communities general approach was toward paying off loans versus building savings. Some of this is pretty obvious (e.g. if the loan rate is lower than your savings account rate, pay the minimum or if it's over 10% pay off the  loan ASAP) but I'm more curious about the areas in between. What would you consider as the max interest rate where you'd still be putting money toward savings? Do you have some sort of formula based on current savings (standardized to months of expenses), outstanding loans, interest rate of those loans, etc. that you use to determine what you do with 'extra' money?

personalfinance,Considering quitting my job without notice to avoid getting stiffed on bonus,"I've been working as an entry level engineer for 2 years at my current company. I will be leaving March 15th to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail (6 months). The March 15th departure is a hard date, I am going with others and our plans our set. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a conversation with my HR person months ago in which I asked about unused PTO and Bonus payouts if the employee quit before they were paid. He said they will not be paid if you are not working there. Last year bonuses were paid around March 27th and I expect it to be the same this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan is this. Request a 2 week vacation starting March 18th to April 1st. And never return...

This is enough to fund my entire AT thru-hike.

dot,Polkadot Network Explained for Non-Techies!,"You  just heard about Polkadot Network and being the curious person that you  are, you then decided to head on to the website to read and understand  what Polkadot means. Unfortunately, you leave more confused as the  website is filled with “Techie Jargon!” Well, you are not alone! Many  have expressed similar views and hence, this primer is here to give you  overview that will serve as a foundation upon which you will build up  your knowledge of what the Polkadot Network is.

It is recommended that you understand what is the blockchain and its use cases.

Well, I’m glad that you are here to understand what the Polkadot Network is.

### Polkadot Network.

#### Is  it a Fashion line that has Polkadots as a signature? With Nodes maybe?  Does it go down well with a Fedora? Hmmmm? Questions, Questions  and more…

To  aid your understanding and make the subject matter as comprehensible as  possible, we will make use of a school analogy. I am your Tutor and you  may call me: Emmanuel.

In  this guide, I will present to you the parts of Polkadot one before the  other and using our school classes analogy, break it up into bits that  you will understand.

What is Polkadot? From their website, [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/#cover) is a heterogeneous multi-chain technology.

Think  of school and then your grade and the various classes you have to take:  music, chemistry, math, physical education and others. In each class  you have to provide your record for attendance. There is a ledger in  each class; When the teacher for a particular subject class calls out  your name, you answer: “present” and all others in the class look at you  as well as the teacher to ensure that it is you who answered and not  anyone else. Your performances and activities in each class are held in a  record for attendance and every day is marked: valid!

If  you already know what is a blockchain, then you know what are ledgers.  From the explanation above, your attendance record for the day was just  entered into the ledger for the particular class that you were in!

There  is an inherent problem herein though. Each class is its own blockchain  platform! This means too many ledgers and no way for all of them to  interact. How then do we solve this problem? Enter the Polkator theory  of Interoperability.

The  Principal has recently decided to introduce an infrastructure (Polkadot  Network) where all of these ledgers can interact! This means, that if  you are in physical education and your records was validated with your  sports wear, we can interact with your records in the chemistry lab  where you had on a lab coat and also in music class where you sat beside  your crush as you wore your favorite Jacket. With this new  infrastructure, the Principal hopes to solve the problems of:

1. Fixing classes timetable for you (Interoperability).

2. Ensuring that you progressively ease through your studies and learning tracks (Scalability).

3. That at every point your record is secure in each class Ledger (Shared Security).

This  infrastructure, set up by the Principal, is a collection of the  different classes with distinct differences as mentioned above.  Information can be spread across the different classes so that your  presence at where you should be can be validated at all times for trust!  This ensures that each class ledger is secure and that information  shared between them are done in trust and executed safely.

These are facets to this infrastructure set up by the Principal which is taken from the section on how it works on the Polkadot [website](https://polkadot.network/#howitworks):

1. “Relay Chains”: Coordinate consensus and transaction delivery between chains.

Given  the school classes analogy, in the infrastructure set up by the  Principal has nodes where a collection of school admins are positioned  to ensure that the information sent between classes gets passed along  and the validity required to achieve consensus on such records is  attained.

2. “Parachains”: Constituent blockchains which gather and process transactions.

These are the separate classrooms which hold your records on their own Blockchains.

3. “Bridges”: Links to Blockchains with their own consensus such as Ethereum.

A Bridge is a special office, which can share your records and retrieve your records from other classes.

#### In  this article you have learned what is Polkadot for a Non Techie point  of view. This is not all there is to it. This is a beginning and from  here you can build your knowledge. In future articles, I will share with  you more information knowledge resources for you to understand the  Polkadot Network.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Grad Student Tax Confusion,"Filing taxes the last few years while I've been in grad school have been a nightmare; however, I think I finally figured it out. I came here to ask whether I truly am understanding how I can go about filing my taxes.

Most of my income this year was a fellowship and a few scholarships. These are paid directly to the school, my tuition/fees are paid, and the remaining balance is then refunded to me. Additionally, this money is untaxed when refunded so in the past I've handed over a huge (by grad student standards) amount of taxes that I owe.

Last tax year, I didn't claim the Lifetime Learning Credit because in a way I never paid a dollar toward my tuition (I probably could have saved myself a few hundred dollars had I done what I did this year).

This year, I was fooling around with TurboTax and reading along in the IRS publications on benefits for education (Publication 970 and Form 8863, for your reference). I came across a few scenarios of ""Judy Green"" and her claiming the lifetime learning credit. I imagined myself as Judy.

Last year, I didn't include the part of my fellowships in my income that went towards my tuition/fees. My income was my refund. I wasn't able to claim the credit. However, one of Judy's scenarios has her scholarships being applied by the school towards tuition but Judy claims the scholarship money that paid the tuition as income, and Judy was able to claim the lifetime learning credit.

I messed around on TurboTax in the education section. When I did not include the money that went towards tuition in my income, I owed $616 to the fed and $40 to the state. When I included the scholarships that went towards tuition as income, I owed $73 to the fed and $254 to the state, and I was finally able to claim quite a bit of the lifetime learning credit.

I attempted to calculate these two scenarios on my own and came up with the same numbers owed to the fed. My understanding is that my income went up (which makes sense as to why I owe more for state) and that the credit then brings my higher than $616 owed to the fed down to $73.

Am I correct in understanding that I can claim my scholarship money that went toward tuition as income so that I can claim the Lifetime Learning Credit?

I'm filing with TurboTax since my case should be fast and simple. State refund shows to be $11, but for my federal return it says I'll get $0 and their reasoning is ""not enough information to calculate refund"" even though they have all my information and they say I'm finished with it. 

My W-2 shows that my total earnings were $2,449 and income was $2099 with $54 paid in income tax, so there's another ~$300 there I should be receiving back, correct? 

Essentially my question is: Am I guaranteed to not get a refund I should be owed if I finish filing through TurboTax (which shows $0) or will I get my correct refund if I finish filing and their system is just messing up somehow with the ""$0"" essentially being a question mark? I just want to know if I should seek another way to file.

personalfinance,All savings in one account to take advantage of interest rate?,"I searched but didnt find anything similar to what Im wondering if anyone else has done.  So Im pretty anal about our finances and being able to track money.  So given that, we have several checkings/savings account, all earmarked (for example, House, Vacation, Car Repairs/purchase, etc).  My wife and I each have our own personal savings we put money into each paycheck as a cushion for anything we deem reasonable to use it for as well.  I recently, within last month or so, opened savings account with AMEX moving from Ally for the % increase, plus I have quite a few CC with Amex and have been nothing but happy with them and their customer support.

My main question here is, do I move the majority of our House savings, Car savings, etc into my savings with Amex to try to larger payouts on the interest rate?  The math eludes me sometimes, but the main thing holding me back is any interest accumulated, if I did need to draw that money out for say the house or car, I'd like to keep the interest that portion earned with it, I hope that makes sense.

personalfinance,Should I purchase a home?,"Hello all, I'm currently at a time in my life where I want to make an investment in real estate. I currently reside in San Diego and will be working here for at least three years and will likely be working here for quite a while longer.  
 
I'm currently renting a nice little place for only $1150 a month and have been living there for almost six years now. I work in the navy and have access to VA home loan which requires no down payment but can only be utilized for a house I will be living in. I say this because I'm also thinking about staying in my current rental and purchasing a house in Jacksonville FL, my hometown, as an investment.  

I think that both locations will see significant appreciation in property value. The advantage of Jacksonville is the price, I can purchase a similar property in Jacksonville for about half the price as San Diego. However, I would require a down payment (which I can afford) and I wouldn't be able to live in it for the foreseeable future. I also don't think the property value in Jacksonville will increase as much as San Diego. Both areas have the advantage in that there's a lot of military members to rent to, which is about as safe a tenant as you can have (the military can obligate them to pay rent and damages).  

I'm curious if this is seen as a good time to purchase a home. Everyone I've been taking to in San Diego is saying that this is pretty much peak sellers market at the moment, and I know the interest rates will be increasing more over the next year or so. I like the idea of purchasing a house that is in a good location for the lower end of what I'm willing to buy ($400k-500k). There's a lot of home flipping going on in San Diego, and i would prefer to buy a home that hasn't been upgraded and given a face lift. My rationale is that the homes that have gotten that $100k face lift will cause a lot more money in the end (after a thirty year loan compounding at least 4%). I would much prefer getting a house on the low end and taking out another loan to have things done myself.

personalfinance,"Filed Tax return, already got my Fed refund, just got more tax docs, need help","Hi all,

I wasn't expecting any extra documents this year, just my w-2. My w-2 includes 401k and HSA stuff, so I thought I was done, and quickly e-filed through TurboTax. I already received my Fed refund via direct deposit in my account. Lo and behold, I received 3 forms, all of which I know are legitimate forms:

A 1095c employer provided health insurance offer and coverage form,

A 1099-sa for my HSA (shows distributions for the year), and

A 5498-SA for HSA contributions.

Now, my question is this: Am I definitely going to need to amend my return? I e-filed thru TurboTax, and I can't amend my return until the 'Amend Return' form becomes available (still not available for a few days). And if so, should I expect my refund to change at all, either more or less?

I didn't have these forms last year when I filed (same employer, 2018 was just my first FULL year with this employer). Is this typical to get them now, and not last year?

Thanks for any and all advice!

Edit 1: pretty much all replies are saying don't bother amending, thank you all so much! Yes, my HSA contributions were on my w-2, which is why receiving that form confused me initially. No unqualified distributions from my HSA this tax year, so I won't be bothering with any amends.

Edit 2: after reading u/sciguyCO 's comment, it seems I'm gonna amend, or at least double check all my numbers. I don't remember if I put  the exact qualified medical expenses in my initial tax return form.

Edit 3: I checked my Form 8889 on my completed tax returns. The total distributions from HSA, AS WELL AS qualified medical expenses paid using HSA distributions are both blank. I plan on amending my return as soon as form 1040X is available (Feb 8th, according to Turbo Tax). I don't expect to actually owe or be owed anything extra in taxes, as this is just declaring information to the government on the already exempt HSA funds. So it looks like form 1099-SA is the only one I'll be needing to do anything with, since my HSA contributions were already included on my W-2 from my employer.",finance

Right now, I have about $4k in student loans at an interest rate of 4%. However, I do not have to start paying off these loans for another 3 years. Since my Roth IRA is growing at a rate of 5-7%, would it be better to not start paying off my loans until I max out my Roth contributions? 

My thinking is that since the rate my money grows in my Roth is greater than the interest rate of my student loans, it would be better to wait to start paying off my student loans until I can't contribute to my Roth any longer. Is this a reasonable strategy?

Wife has a loan with ~5 years remaining- repayment is $496 monthly.

personalfinance,Confused with making the optimal decisions.,"So I'll try and keep this as short as possible. I am 24 and just finished completing my Master's at a good school and have recently started a new job paying ~70k with a solid career progression timeline in my field. Total student loan debt, including grad school is ~65k and I have ~9k left on my car ( bought a used, reliable car ). The interest rates for my student loans are all at 5% or lower and my car loan is at 4% fixed. My credit score is 780.

I currently have very little in my retirement accounts as I have just started my first real job. My company matches effectively up to 1.5% for 401k, but does offer a pension.

May parents have been generous enough to let me live in an extra room they have, so I don't have to pay any rent. I live in a Hcol area where a single bedroom a month is ~1600 before parking and other misc expenses. Outside of my loans, most of my living expenses are covered by my family until I have more manageable debt. However, I want to be able to move out as soon as possible as I am a bit embarrassed by this fact at my age, and I know for a fact my family themselves is financial unstable right now, and don't know how much longer this scenario can last for me.

To the main point of this post. I am absolutely paralyzed on how to make decisions to optimize my debt. I feel like I should put as much into my 401k as possible as it reduces my federal withholding, while being able to grow at a ~7% rate over time. I also think that I should stretch out the loans as long as I can as I can use the interest on them to reduce my taxes as well, and use my credit card to effectively reduce the percentage by 1.5% ( I would use the cash back from the monthly payments to immediately pay down more debt, effectively making the 5% drop to 3.5%). I would then proceed to pay of my car as its 4% interest rate would be the largest one to tackle (I cant use my CC to reduce this like my student loans as my financial institution wont allow it). I would use the remainder to build an emergency fund for ~3 months of salary pay. Or, am I going about this all wrong? Should I be attacking the student loans first as the interest accruing off the principal is larger ( gross wise) than the interest accruing on the car? Or should I build an emergency fund first, then attack the car as it's a depreciating asset? I just feel overwhelmed at what to do at this point and any advice is welcome!",finance

By messing with numbers in TurboTax, we would owe $844 for federal and a minimal amount on state taxes. If we contribute to a traditional IRA, we get a $70 fed refund and $481 in state taxes back. Am I right in thinking that this is our best choice?

To elaborate briefly, I switched jobs this year that required me to pay back a sign-on bonus from a previous year (2016). I checked with HR, and after paying that back they reduced my gross income by the amount I paid. 

The way I remember this situation being explained to me was that, say for example I initially had a gross of 50,000, paid the sign on of 5000 back and ended  up with a  gross of 45,000, I could expect to get money back on the money I paid back, being throughout the year I was taxed like I had earned 50,000 when in actuality, that was not the case.

 So the gross income between my last paystub and my W2 makes sense, it seems like they followed the above process. My question is..

On my last paystub from that company, my Federal Withholding was listed at 2000 some dollars. On my W2 from that same company, Box 2 for Federal Income Tax withheld was listed at $820. 

I've done Google searches about ""W2 federal income tax vs  Federal Withholding"", and other combos to try and get an idea why that may be, and I'm not having any luck. The only thing I found was from a www.schencksc.com page that says Box 2 on my W2 and my Pay stub federal withholding values should match, but I'm not super confident in the reliability of that page. 

SHOULD my Federal Withholding match my Federal Income Tax withheld (box 2)? Could the sign on payback affect what's listed on my W2 vs my paystub (I paid the bonus back a month or so after my last pay stub).",finance

But because of that, I'm at a loss on how to approach it now. I've done FAFSA and the EFC for 2018-2019 was 6802, while the EFC for 2019-2020 is 0. I think I'll get about $10,000-$15,000 in federal student loans (I don't really know how it works or if I'll even get that much, but I know I won't get any grants because I already have a Bachelor's). The total cost of the BSN program (at a for-profit school because that was actually the cheapest program I could find in my city) is $40,750. I would have to pay in a 3 month basis. Roughly, $2,600 for the first month, $1,300 for the second and third, and then the cycle starts again until the end of the program 1.5 years later. So my dilemma is; where should I go to get private student loans? Or should I try to get my single mother to take out Federal Parent loans (how do you even get those?)? Should I get all of the remaining money in one lump sum loan from one organization all at once or borrow throughout the time as needed? My mother graciously offered to help pay for the second degree, but she can't really give much and I will not be working during nursing school.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I need to get $40,750 in nursing student loans and I can't work at the same time. Where should I go and should I borrow as much as possible all at once (can I even do that?)?

personalfinance,TurboTax Question: Married Filling Jointly vs Separately?,"Hi,

First thing to mention is that I've filed with TurboTax for the past 4 years and used the live help last year after moving and having income in multiple states. I plan to use the live help again this year based on my questions/comments below. Just looking for some simple feedback.

Very simple question, is changing from Married Filing Jointly to Married Filing Separately as simple as clicking the button under ""My Info""? We usually got a reasonable amount of back for the past two years filing jointly (but also lived in a different state and had different incomes). This year TurboTax showed that we owed drastically more this year than we've ever received.  I changed to Married Filing Separately and nothing else. Now it shows a small amount owed for federal but a large state refund (net refund).  What happened?? Will my wife need to actually log in and file separately or does Married Filing Separately actually submit for both of us?  I checked out TurboTax's information and saw that [it may be better for us because our incomes are similar.](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/marriage/when-married-filing-separately-will-save-you-taxes/L7FD32bvj). The software may have changed from standard to itemized? I have to check.",finance
personalfinance,"My SO's tax refund has shrunk significantly since last year, which is suspicious considering she doesn't make very much (she's a student) but still made more than last year.","My girlfriend has been working for the same company for the past 2-3 years. Her pay (hourly rate) has stayed the same since 2017 but she started working more hours in 2018, therefore her total income in 2018 is significantly higher—she went from making just above $11k in 2017 to just over $16k in 2018 (she's a full-time student).

Now, doing her taxes this year we expected that her refund would *increase* from last year. She got a refund of around $2 - $3k last year (for 2017) but her refund this year looks like it's shrunk to just over $1k. She hasn't changed anything with regard to how her pay/taxes are setup with her company from last year. She pays 23% - 25% of her paycheck to taxes (federal, state, social security, etc., etc., the whole bag) yet her federal withholding on her W-2 is being shown as only ~$1400 and her state withholding as just over $400 (she got over $700 refund from state taxes last year).

We can see that she's now making just enough to no longer qualify for EIC as a single adult (the cutoff is apparently $15k) but we're still confused how her refund has shrunk so dramatically.

If she made $16.5k in 2018 and 23% - 25% of her paycheck is going to taxes, how much should she really be getting back as a refund this year?",finance

Not that I can't afford it with my current income, but I don't want such a huge payment ($900/mo).

Adding to this, the finance manager was extremely scummy. He kept pushing the extended warranty for $5k, and then when I asked for the company to look it up, he said Fidelity - and they had a 1 star rating on consumer reports. Then he proceeded to pull interest rate ""vouchers"" out of thin air, bringing the monthly payment down.

personalfinance,IBR minimum payment is less than the interest...,"Hey all, been lurking here a while and have made some huge improvements in my financial situation thanks in no small part to your advice and the flowchart. I was just going back to look over things in general and I came to step 3 ([https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics))   
""Step 3: Pay down high interest debts

After you ensure you're taking advantage of your employer match, you should use your extra money to pay down your high interest debt (e.g., debts much over 4% interest rate).

In all cases, you should make the minimum payments on all of your debts before paying down specific debts more quickly.""

&amp;#x200B;

My situation:

&amp;#x200B;

I have around 150K in debt, most of it student loans, some of it personal loans and CC debt. I am paying around 2000 a month to debts right now, almost 50% of my take home. I have amassed some emergency fund, but not quite the 3 months worth, so I am still making payments to that each month. 

My real question revolves around my student loan payments, which are in REPAYE (IBR). My monthly minimum payments are only 163$, average interest around 6%, total principal at 132k right now. I have personal loans around 9k with 10% interest and a private student loan for 12k at 3.8% interest. I also have about 5k left on a credit card balance transfer that is interest free for another few months, then it goes up to 18%(ish). I have been making the minimums on everything, and then applying leftovers to knockout the CC debt, which will avalanche into the personal loan and then finally start attacking the student loans (forecast to happen in about 6-8 months) 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I making a huge mistake by letting the Student Loans continue to accrue interest (because my minimum is less than the interest)?

personalfinance,Bankruptcy/Federal Debt/Tax Return question,"Hi there, everyone. Like most that come here, I've a predicament I'm hoping I can get some guidance on.

My wife and I are in the process of filing for bankruptcy. We need to make a final payment($1,200) to the lawyer's office for it to be submitted. We were hoping to use our Tax Refund to make this payment, as money is obviously still fairly tight.

However, I found out about one or two weeks ago that I've got a Federal Debt that's a bit unexpected. DFAS decided I need to repay part of a sign-on bonus from my time in the military. I've been out of the military for 8 years at this point, and this is the first I'd heard of it. I took an early out during a time when my particular state was vastly over strength(Nat'l Guard) and I guess that means I didn't qualify for that 2nd half of the bonus that I'd gotten a year prior to my departure.

I tried to call DFAS and they'd *already* turned the debt over to the Department of Treasury, and I confirmed via their toll free number that it is a debt that may qualify for my refund to be reduced. I've been unable to get ahold of anyone at the Dept. of Treasury today with frequent disconnects - but I will keep trying.

With all that story being told, what are my options as far as what I'm going to be able to do? If I get ahold of them, will they even be able to help me the potential refund issue or am I entirely at their whim? I don't know how I'll be able to afford the remainder of the lawyer's fees without the return, nor do I know how I'll get caught up on other payments of which I am behind.

I currently have $3k in my savings account, about $3k coming in from taxes, about $1k coming in from a bursar refund, and roughly $1000 I keep in my safe for unexpected expenses. That's about $8k total that I don't touch. 

My biggest impending expenses are:

 1. Graduating college without a job lined up and possibly having to support myself without income until I find a job.

 2.  I want to take a trip to backpack Europe for about a month after I graduate. I know this is a frivolous expense, but it's important to me before I get a career and move on with my adult life. 

 3. Also, I do have about $1,300 in credit card debt with a pretty hefty interest rate and of course student loans of about $19k.

I'm planning on budgeting about $5k for my trip to Europe and I know I'll need a cushion for after I graduate to find a career. I considered taking out a loan with a low interest rate to solely pay off my credit card debt and use for my vacation. I've just never had this much money saved up and don't know what to do.

**1)** If the 1099 isn't actually a form you fill out, where does interest get placed? I used the free version of Turbo Tax, so there's a good chance I just missed that section completely or didn't think about it because I'm still new to particular area of tax law.

**2)** Say I made $9.99 in interest from both savings accounts. They're both below $10, so I probably wouldn't receive a 1099 notification from either. I'm assuming, though, that it's the *total* amount of interest made that's the most important thing?",finance

On a personal note I just learned FICO is not the same as a credit score from the three major bureaus.

Also there are different FICO scores depending if you are getting a mortgage or a car loan or other stuff.

I use Mint and Credit Sesame and they both use TU so I am going to use the wikipedia article to find my vantage score from Experian and Equifax. I also have a CitiCard so I can see my FICO 8 based off of my Equifax report.

personalfinance,"An curious but unfortunate question on marriage, taxes, and student loans","I won't make this long so ask any questions you need to get more required details.

Background

My wife doesn't work or have any forms of income. She has $30-50k in Federal student loans. She ""never plans to pay them unless we become rich"". She doesn't care about her credit. I'm the only person on our main bank account (had it pre marriage) and mortgage loan (she is on the title....we live in Texas).

Questions: 

If we file jointly then I know that messes up income driven student loan repayment plans, but since she isn't going to pay them, will they come after my wages or bank account that she isn't listed on? How will filing jointly affect my income or future financial accounts? (Mortgage which only has my name on the loan, new bank accounts that will only have my name, new investment accounts that only have my name, etc). 

Edit: 
Thanks a lot for the responses. A little more details on the situation. Most of the reasons why my wife can't work right now stems from the sense of hopelessness due to some newly undiagnosed mental health issues from multiple PTSD-worthy events back to back to back. Right now she can't work. In the future she may be willing to pay them. I wanted to be very blunt and dry in my description because I don't want a bunch of replies that are relationship advice or the ""pay it because it'll help you in the long run"" replies. I just needed the facts to this scenario. I just kind of needed to know how this effects ME and only ME. Sounds like an asshole move I know but trust me it's not. It's just getting all the facts laid out so the ""best"" decision can be made. Ultimately paying something towards her loans would be the best decision but that part is out of my control. And using my income for income based repayment would make the payments it unaffordable.

It obviously makes life a tiny bit harder financially but as long as it doesn't effect me then I think our financial future will be fine as far as being approved for stuff since she won't be on it. And I never take out more than I can chew by myself. Over 800 credit score, emergency fund filled, the rest of the money is working on gaining interest or is in the stock market, have a job that pays over 6 figures in Texas, will be partial owner of a company that might bring a 7-8 figure payout in the next 2 years with a 6 figure payout later this year, etc. One day we will pay this off in a lump sum payment and be done with it.

personalfinance,Debt Snowballing And Massive Student Loans,"I've just started chipping away at about 13k in credit card debt.  Most of this was acquired during or just after the recession when I was either unemployed or severely underemployed but didn't qualify for any sort of assistance programs in the city I live in as the minimum single income was just $200-300 a month under what I was making annually then.

I'm following the snowball program but I'm puzzling out how to make the minimum work on my student loans.

I live in Seattle, which is very expensive.I work in tech but I work for a nationally recognized brand that is famous for low balling its employees.  I took the job when it was offered because at the time it was a 30k increase a year and we were struggling that it felt like a lifeline.  As the city has gotten more expensive, I feel like I'm sinking again.

Based on repayment formulas (I owe $135k combined between undergrad and grad school), they believe that on paper I can make a $1,000 monthly payment based on what my income is listed as but the repayment formulas do a really terrible job of accounting for the cost of living in most major cities.   Even without other credit card debt, I wouldn't be able to consistently pay this much and there seems to be no review or appeals process for these situations?  The only I've been told is to consider putting my loans into deferment so I don't go into default but the interest continues to stack.

I've considered finding a better paying job in my field but the big sticking point is my health insurance is really very, very generous and my partner has a chronic illness that my insurance covers his medications at rates we can afford.  His job's health insurance is total crap and the deductibles are insane.  We don't qualify for ACA coverage because again on paper we make too much money.  The long and short of it is:  we don't want to gamble with his health and end up in a situation where we can't afford his medications.

In the meantime, I don't know what to do about my student load.  Prior to the recession, I was in a federal job that had me on a 10 year payment, loan forgiveness path.  We lived in another state where the cost of living was much, much lower so I could make the minimum monthly payment.  The recession blew all of that up.  By the time I was able to come off furlough status, I was 18 months out of work, living in this current city, we were both finally re-employed and we weren't in a position to just pick up and move back.

I'm kind of at my lowest point with all this.  We have talked about filing for bankruptcy but that will haunt us for 7-10 years and with a debt threshold so low it hardly seems worth it.  In the meantime, my student loans are out there - unpayable at the 'affordable' repayment plan because on paper they think I make gobs of money and I don't know what to do.  We don't have family we can appeal to - his parents have both passed away and my mom is on a fixed income.

I feel like shit, I'm anxious, and I don't know what do.

investing,Preferred shares and the equity premium,"I've been reading a bit about equity premium. Some people have low estimates for the next 10 years of equity returns, for example Jack Bogle guessed 4-5% nominal.

Some AA preferred shares are priced at a premium of [2.59%](https://www.td.com/document/PDF/investor/ProspSupp_Eng.pdf) to 5 year federal bonds and reset every 5 years. This would suggest that the equity premium is at least 2.59% with a total return around 4.75%.

Common shares have more risk and an uncertain return. There are lower credit rating companies with higher 6% yields. This would suggest the nominal equity returns are 5%+

personalfinance,Kid graduated college and got a job in another state tax filing for 2018 questions.,"1. Kid lived at college in home state (OR) until mid June, moved to new state (NY) to start a paid internship then got a job at another company.
2. Parents paid $3500 tuition for kid in 2018.
3. Both states have income tax but all income was earned in new state.

Questions:

1. Should we claim kid as dependent on federal so we can deduct the tuition?
2. I'm figuring kid will file Part Year Resident in each state, would #1 jeopardize that?
3. Would it make more sense to not claim kid as dependent and have them claim the tuition?",finance

personalfinance,25K credit debt: best options to pay down ?,"I've been a lazy financial person for a while and need to get my sheeeet together.  

I make a good salary as an Engineer.  I hate my job and am considering a change as I've almost quit a couple times.  I'll even take a large pay cut to switch jobs so for these suggestions I'd like to base it off of making 75K even though I make considerably more at the moment.  I'm married but my wife only makes about 35K.  She co-owns a business with here brother and we expect to grow a little but not a lot.  Hopefully she paid her taxes correctly this year and we don't owe any surprise big numbers this year.  


I have 5 credit cards but most all the debt sits on two and about 12K on each (14.5% int on one, 17 on the other).  800 on a discovery card I plan on paying off this month.  I have a card I pay off every month and just use for day to day expenses to get pts on.  It's through my bank. 

I do have about 9K in savings.  that's a little over 3 months of expenses saved up for emergency because I hate my job so much.  My wife has about 2K in savings. 7% of my paycheck goes to 401K as well.  I saved up pretty aggressively as well because my dad had a crazy fight with cancer and passed away last October as well.  sort of has messed me up over the last couple years.  


we rent a house for $1400. 
we only have one car payment at $280/mo and that car gets paid off this July!!!  we have two cars though and a dog.  
Wife keeps about 1-3K on her credit card but it pretty good about paying them off.  
Got married a couple years ago and I did pay off the ring already. 
I pay about $340/mo in student loans.  owe $8,800 on one, $1,000 on another.  paying off the $1,000 loan would free up a $145/mo.  The wife has zero student loans.  


**We want to buy a house in around a year if the market starts to soften up a bit.**  

I don't have issues constantly charging things to my credit cards and have just been really bad at focusing to pay them off.  It hasn't helped that I haven't re-applied for zero interest rate cards in a long long time to help my situation out.  

FICO score is 787 according to Discovery card.  My wife's is right around 770 last time we checked.  


**What are my best options for this 25K of credit card debt?**


Sofi or ?? lender for a personal loan for 3-4 years at around 7.5% interest?
edit: Best deal I got from entering my info into credible.com was a 5.89% rate but 7.25APR for 24K 3 year term totaling 26242 in loan cost(Lending Club offer).  

apply for a zero % interest card and hope to get a 20K limit to put most of my debt on and pay down the highest interest card ASAP?  

I have not called my CC companies and ask for reduce interest rates yet.   

I worry that if I don't get all the debt put onto a personal loan that I might not do the right thing down the line with credit cards and get another zero percent int rate card and make sure I don't pay more interest charges than I should be able to get away with.  


Thank you for the help.  

Edit 1:

I realize I have to come up with a budget, be more frugal and rapidly pay down debt.  I'm work on the budget and plan with the wife.  

The main goal of the post is to get advise on damage control and Reduce interest paid on the way of making better decisions to pay down debt fast.  

Personal loan or new credit card?

What are the benefits and dissadvantages of each?  

Does it make sense to keep debt on a 14.5% interest card while you pay it down aggressively instead of getting a 0% card until u pay it off?  

Which option is best long term?  


EDIT 2: 

I should have also pointed out that I got laid off twice in past 3 years(aerospace industry can suck). I haven't had a full time job the entire time. a couple 6 months stints of not having a job caused some issues.  I had debt before I got laid off and still have it now.  I was working on my debt before I got laid off the first time and then things went down hill.  We'll be making budgets and being way more frugal starting now. We haven't been doing a lot of spending lately. We've just been stagnate in decisions because my father died and I had no clue how much money I'd have to help out the family with and still need to drop some money to help out my mom. as I mentioned in the original post, I hate my job as well.   These life things have just sort of locked me up in a room in my mind and in real life but it's time to get out.",finance

investing,The First Marijuana Hearing Of The New Congress Has Been Scheduled - Positive outlook.,"Running from marijuana investments may be something you regret if you are already invested.

Congressional Democrats are already moving ahead with plans to consider broad changes to federal marijuana laws in 2019.

Whereas the Republican-controlled House for the past several years had blocked votes on most cannabis-related measures, the chamber’s new Democratic majority on Wednesday announced it has scheduled a hearing for next week to examine the difficulties that marijuana businesses face in opening and maintaining bank accounts.

Titled, “Challenges and Solutions: Access to Banking Services for Cannabis-Related Businesses,” the hearing will take place on February 13 before a subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee.

Although a growing number of states are moving to legalize marijuana for medical or recreational use, cannabis remains federally prohibited. As a result, and despite a 2014 guidance memo released on the topic by the Obama administration aimed at clearing up the issue, many financial services providers remain reluctant to work with the industry out of fear of violating money laundering or drug laws.
“When we introduced this bill six years ago, we warned that forcing these businesses to deal in cash was threatening public safety. No hearing was given,” Rep. Denny Heck (D-WA) said in an email, referring to marijuana banking legislation he and Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) have filed for the past several Congresses.

“Chairwoman Waters has made it one of her first priorities to address this urgent and overdue issue, demonstrating that she understands the threat to public safety and the need for Congress to act,” Heck said of the committee’s new leader. “We have a bipartisan proposal to allow well-regulated marijuana businesses to handle their money in a way that is safe and effective for law enforcement to track. I am eager to get to the work of refining it and passing it into law.”

That a hearing on the issue was in the works was first noted earlier this week by Politico, and Marijuana Moment reported that the full committee is also actively planning to vote on a marijuana banking bill in the coming months.

The newly scheduled marijuana hearing is a signal that Democrats intend to move cannabis legislation this year, and is likely to be the first in a series of committee-level actions across the House on the issue.

“The upcoming hearing presents a real opportunity for the Democratic Party to assert their leadership by finally beginning the conversation on how we end the failed policy of marijuana criminalization,” Justin Strekal, political director for NORML, said.

Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) suggested in a memo to party leaders late last year that they pursue a step-by-step approach to legalize marijuana in 2019. His plan recommends that Financial Services and other committees first begin holding hearings on incremental reforms like banking access, research expansion and medical cannabis for military veterans before passing bills on those issues as part of a lead up to ultimately approving broader legislation to formally end federal marijuana prohibition by the end of the year.

A House bill to protect banks from being punished for working with state-legal marijuana businesses that Heck and Perlmutter introduced garnered 95 cosponsors in the last Congress, and 20 senators signed onto a companion bill, but neither were given hearings or brought up for votes.

“Depriving state-legal cannabis businesses of basic banking services and forcing them to operate entirely in cash presents a significant safety risk, not just to those businesses and their employees, but to the public,” Don Murphy, director of federal policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in an email. “Support for addressing the cannabis banking problem is strong and bipartisan, and it appears Congress may be ready to adopt a real, commonsense solution. Members concerned about public safety should be jumping at the chance to express their support for this legislation.”

“This hearing is historic for cannabis policy reform advocates, business owners and the banking sector, and could directly lead to the first in what is hopefully a series of positive changes in the 2019 legislative cycle,” 

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, for example, suggested in testimony before a House committee early last year that he supports letting marijuana businesses store their profits in banks.
“I assure you that we don’t want bags of cash,” he said. “We do want to find a solution to make sure that businesses that have large access to cash have a way to get them into a depository institution for it to be safe.”

In a separate hearing Mnuchin revealed that addressing the issue is at the “top of the list” of his concerns.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the growing gap between state and federal marijuana laws “puts federally chartered banks in a very difficult situation… It would great if that could be clarified.”
And last month, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting called on Congress to “act at the national level to legalize marijuana if they want those entities involved in that business to utilize the U.S. banking system.”

Meanwhile, although many major financial institutions are staying away from the cannabis industry, federal data does show that an inceasing number of banks are beginning to work with marijuana growers, sellers, processors and related businesses.


So in short - Don't sell out of fear just yet.

gaming,My opinions on stories in games,"**(WARNING: Long-ass post. Only read and comment if you want to - I ain't forcing you. Just don't complain about my post being ""too long to read"" or such shit. Thank you.)** 

&amp;#x200B;

A story in a video game should be designed to compliment the gameplay, NOT compromise it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really sick and tired of mainstream gamers nowadays fitting into two categories typically: Those who play online multiplayer battle royale type games... and those who value story and characters more than the actual gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no problems with implementing stories in games. But when I play a game, at least a singleplayer one, I play it for the gameplay and the immersion. Which is why I really hate when I have to think outside of the immersion because I know the story is compromising and thereby limiting what I can and can't do.

&amp;#x200B;

A recent example is the Resident Evil 2 remake. You know the Tyrant there, the big-ass guy in a fedora and trench coat? You can't kill him, you can only make him lose his hat and get down on his knees for a bit. I don't mind him being very difficult to kill - but to be impossible to kill, just so that the lady can then rescue Leon from him by crashing her car into him? That's bullshit. And it's easy to fix. How about, you CAN if you try really hard to kill the Tyrant, and then ANOTHER Tyrant appears in the cutscene that hasn't appeared before?

&amp;#x200B;

Another example is with parts where you are ""supposed"" to be killed by an enemy to progress. Do you know a game that does this right? Bloodborne. The first werewolf creature is ""supposed"" to kill you so that you can get to know what happens when you die. However, you CAN if you are really stubborn and dedicated actually kill the werewolf before it kills you. Nothing in Bloodborne compromises the gameplay, and that's the way it should be.

&amp;#x200B;

It IS sad to me, because it holds me back from loving some games as much as I want to. Like, I really love Red Dead Redemption 2, but I don't feel free to do what I want despite it being an open world type of game with a lot of RPG elements. Like, if it was up to me, I'd leave Micah to get hanged, or at least kill him upon releasing him after learning what a psycho he is. Not even mentioning when he goes into a building to murder someone, and you are forced to stand outside and wait like a jackass.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I don't really care all that much about stories in games. And the problem is, mainstream gamers are so simpleminded nowadays that they think that that means I must want to play dumb brainless multiplayer games. But I don't. I want a fully immersive experience where I am free to play it as I see fit.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't need a fully embracing 100% free open world RPG. I can play linear games, no problem. But I don't want the game to feel like I am not allowed to do this or that because the story tells me so.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, a story in a game should COMPLIMENT the gameplay, not COMPROMISE it. Unless you enjoy ""playing"" those interactive stories like Telltale did for The Walking Dead... but that barely even qualifies as an actual game.",technology

personalfinance,Best Way to Attack 20K in Credit Card Debt without Totally Depriving Myself of Fun,"Credit card debt question. I'm a pediatric nurse in my 30s and have about $20K in credit card debt. The card is Chase and holds a 17.74% interest rate. I just graduated from graduate school (I dropped everything to become a nurse), so I have debt elsewhere, but I'd like to focus on paying down my CC debt first because it has a higher interest rate (and to be honest, I'm probably going to the grave with that school debt). Anyway, I'm wondering what's the best and most efficient way to attack this - I've looked into personal loans and Lightstream gave me the best offer - they could give me 13% interest rate on a 20K loan, which was the best offer I got and would have me paying $400 a month for 6 years. Also, for background I make about $3k/month after taxes, my credit score is in the 670s, I've made a budget and have been pretty good about sticking to it, and I rarely eat out. Finally, I know it sounds silly, but I'm not really willing to go 100% barebones on my budget, because to be candid, pediatric nursing is hard (but I love it) and I need to treat myself sometimes. 

TLDR: Should I go the personal loan route or just keep plugging away at paying $500/month for the next 5 or so years? Also, I am completely open to other tips/opinions/options.",finance
personalfinance,21 Y.O in USA Financial Checkup,"Hey personal finance! I just wanted to check in and see how my financials are doing from a broader perspective. I'm 21, and paid off all $20k of debt early last year. Had some big life changes that brought my gross income to $50k salary plus job bonuses (I expect them to be about $5k-$10k), but I had to purchase a car again.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my current expenses:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Bill:|Amount (per month):|
|:-|:-|
|Rent|$375|
|Massage Membership|$49.95|
|Internet|$65|
|Netflix|$11.97|
|Car Payment|$174|
|Gym Membership|$24|
|Car Insurance|$344.89|
|Hulu|$13.63|
|Security System Subscription|$11|
|Electric Bill|$150 (usually closer to $110, but peak of summer and peak of winter make it swing a bit)|
|Music Streaming Subscription|$9.99|
|Food|$425 (this includes eating out, some bar hopping with friends)|
|Gas|$45|
|Haircuts|$45|

I take home $1405.28 biweekly, which has health, dental, and vision deductions as well as 4% going to my 401k to capture the match.

&amp;#x200B;

Retirement savings is now at around $2,500, hoping to fully fund an IRA in addition to my 401k this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Only debt is my car loan, at $7,223.52 for a 2016 Mazda 3. Financed at 7%. Not underwater on the loan! But I will need a 90k mile servicing soon, which entails (as I can find online) the serpentine and AC belts, oil change, cabin and engine air filters, spark plugs, transmission and power steering fluid, and I may be due for breaks at that point (might be able to get to the next oil change for those). I've been thinking of refinancing my car at a lower interest rate now that my score has gone up, but don't want to take the credit hit at the same time. I'm hoping to pay off my car this year with my job bonuses, as I have a $10k one due sometime, plus a few $500-$1,500 ones that will probably come at the beginning of Q2.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my tax refund today of $395, which I immediately transferred to my high yield savings, bringing my balance to $1,500.

&amp;#x200B;

My insurance is high because of being a single male under 25, and I do have an at fault accident from 2016 still floating around. This is the lowest I've ever paid for insurance though, which is nice. A big motivator to paying off my car is being able to drop some insurance coverage to save money (knowing I'll open myself up to more risk if my car ever gets damaged).

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's everything! Sorry this post is gigantic. Please feel free to pick apart and critique everything here, I figured the beginning of the year is a good time to correct anything before it's too late!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: formatting, grammar. I also use my Citi card to get 2% back on all of my spending aside from rent, which gives me like $30+ in rewards each month :) FICO is 695 as of 1/27/19, TransUnion is 735 and Equifax is 731, which increase consistently each month.",finance

personalfinance,I have unreliable income should I invest it or pay of debt?,"I am in a somewhat unusual situation, My SO is active duty and I work a fairly specialized field. When I am able to find a job in my field I make pretty good money, but because we move frequently I also find myself out of a job regularly and I can be out of work for long periods. I am currently working and we are trying to decide what is the best way to used the extra income. We always build a  healthy savings account to tied us over when I am not working. There is still income left over after allocating money to replenish the account and we are looking at 2 options for the extra income.

Option 1 -Pay off cars, we have 2 cars loans right now. Interest rates of aprox 1.6-1.8% for both, Vehicle 1 has just under 10K and Vehicle 2 is around 8K. We pay around $800 monthly in car loans, we would be able to pay both cars off by the end of the year if we sink the rest of my paycheck into the loans.

PRO-we have extra money to invest in other things or to help us out when I am not working once they are paid off.

Con- We are not really saving any money paying off the cars early.

Option 2- start an investment fund, not sure if we would manage it our self or pay someone to to do that for us, we are not versed in the stock market but we could learn.

Pro- investing in our future, potential for great monetary gains.

Con- potential for great loss, money is not available if we need it.


I would like to hear what you guys think would be best, or if we have missed an option that would be better. 
Just for clarification, besides our mortgages the vehicles are the only debt we have. 
We are early 30's, no children, and we both have retirement funds set up individually.

personalfinance,Need a new Internet bank. Recommendations?,"TL;DR: Looking for a couple recommendations for ""Internet banks"" besides Cap One with high interest rates for checking, savings, and money market, and a solid UI acceptable for for someone with an accounting/finance background.  Ideally would like to look at a couple that have UI demos.

Full:
Have been on ING Direct for checking, savings, and money market accounts since the mid-00's and used to love it pre-Cap One.  Only thing I missed from it was a cash flow forecaster, but the UI was simple enough that in under 30s I could do it in excel.

Capital One's new UI has been horrendous.  After 2+ years it's a Frankenstein of the old UI and a new tile-based UI.  The general ""Tile"" UI concept is great on phones, but makes no sense on a computer.  I've had enough of not being able to tell if transactions are duplicated (making simple cashflows require lots of extra clicks), not being able to tell if I'm linking my account with my wife's, issues finding a payee in a list of 30 that isn't sorted in any way, etc...

My divorce ended up costing me a lot more money than I anticipated (custody battle that turned out well, so worth it) and I'm now in debt.  Relevant financial info is: 

1 credit card with 20k at 19.2% 

1 card with 14.5K at 16.5%

10k car loan at 3.4%.  

I'm a federal employee with about 80k left in my TSP (government retirement plan) and I make 80k a year.  My thought is to get a TSP loan for 35k at 2.63% to pay off the cards, and to continue paying the car loan ($400/month) directly to the bank.  Even though I'm going to miss out on the bounce back if I decrease my retirement, I still think I would save a lot of money by paying off my credit card debt with the TSP loan.  Plus, while I don't have bad spending habits, my rent plus child support make it difficult to pay anything more than the minimum payments each month.  I am planning to move to a cheaper apartment, but due to the area and having a young child, I can't find a place below $1100 a month.   I'm upside down on my car so selling that isn't an option.  As I work for the DoD, I'm not worried about losing my job (it's incredibly hard to get fired so if leadership doesn't like you they ""promote"" you out of their department).

personalfinance,Looking for advice for how to handle tax refund: Two options,"I currently have approximately $16,000 in federal student loans, which range in interest rates from 3.4 to 6.8%. My plan is to refinance those as soon as I can to a lower interest rate, but I can’t do that until my credit improves. I have been working on it and have increased it by 47 points in the past two months (largely due to advice from this sub!). So, the ultimate goal is to improve my credit to the point that I can qualify for a decent refinance rate. This leads to my current dilemma.

I am going to receive $3100 for my tax refund. There are two things I could do with this money, and I am really struggling to determine what the best option is to achieve my ultimate goal. The possible options are:

1. Pay a chunk of my private student loan, which is currently $3700 and has a 10% interest rate. My thought is that I could put the tax refund toward this, which would pay off a solid chunk of that loan, and make it far more manageable to pay off relatively quickly. I might even end up paying that one off before I get to a point with my credit where I could refinance the loans. A major pro of this option is that it knocks out the loan with the largest interest rate, and I think the psychological boost from knocking this one out would be really motivational for me, because this has been an incredibly stressful process and even though I have made a LOT of progress, I still just feel like I’m throwing money at problems that aren’t getting any better (they are, but they’re getting smaller, not disappearing.  Rationally I know that this is working, but it still feels bad, you know?).

2. Pay off a chunk of my credit card debt, which is the major thing that’s killing my credit right now.  I don’t have any missed payments, but I have a really high revolving utilization (92%) because of grad school.  I currently owe $6600 to the credit card, so the tax refund would drop my utilization percentage (to about 49%), which would go a long way toward boosting my credit (which is, of course, the ultimate goal).  The credit card is currently under payment protection due to my graduation/recent move, which means that (a) it’s not collecting interest until July and (b) I don’t have to make a payment on it until July, though I have consistently been doing so.

My dilemma is this: paying off the credit card seems like a better idea on the surface, because paying that down will really help my credit, leading to the ability to refinance my loans.  But, the credit card isn’t collecting interest right now, and the private loan IS.  I’m worried that if I pay off the credit card, it will still take a while for my credit score to reflect that, and that I’ll end up having to pay a lot of interest on the private loan before I can refinance.  In addition, it would be really nice to have the psychological boost of nearly paying off that private loan—but then the credit card is still incredibly high.

I’m interested in hearing what others think the best options might be as I weigh this decision.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",finance

&gt;On Jan. 25, nine days after Bogle’s passing, in a new filing for another batch of funds, Vanguard had stripped out most of that language, leaving just this shorter note on Page 15:

&gt;""The Vanguard Group is owned jointly by the funds it oversees and thus indirectly by the shareholders in those funds. Most other mutual funds are operated by management companies that are owned by third parties—either public or private stockholders—and not by the funds they serve.”

&gt;In the new filing and other current Vanguard statements to the SEC and investors, there are:

&gt; No more claim that Vanguard is a “mutual mutual,"" a legal status not recognized under federal securities laws. Insurance companies, savings banks, farm cooperatives, credit unions and individual mutual funds can be organized as enterprises where customers are owners and have specific rights, but there aren’t similar laws for investment companies or fund groups.
No more claim that Vanguard’s way offers a “no profit"" contrast to the “profit component” that other companies pack into their management fees. Indeed, company officials acknowledge it is a private, for-profit company that earns profits and pays income taxes.
&gt; No more claim that Vanguard operates “on an at-cost basis,"" as if the funds charge the affiliated management company only what it costs for fund services, without the usual business overhead and profit margins.",finance

personalfinance,"$30k defaulted private student loan debt, wages garnished, Please help!","Hi PF,

First time poster in this sub, and I've read a lot of helpful information trying to figure out what I need to do to fix this self-inflicted situation, but I'm reaching out to see if there's anything I'm missing.

Coming clean/confession time:

My parent and I both grew up in poverty, so neither of us are/were financially savvy.  I made mistakes, and parent made mistakes too.  My parent took out a private student loan(s?) for me when I was 18 (~15 years ago). Neither of us paid this loan, because...well, maybe embarrassment, shame, avoidance?  We ignorantly did not pay the debt, but I'm here because I want to make this right.  I'm here because it seems like you're all significantly more financially responsible than me and I'm pleading for your help.

What's happening:

* Parent retired at 65, collecting social security of $895 per month + pension from ex spouse $340 per month = $1,235 per month. Owns a home assessed at $105k which is taxable at $78,500 - gifted from my grandparents, now deceased. Also owns junker car probably valued &lt;$2k.

* US Dept of Education is garnishing parent's Social Security check for $118 or $135 per month. Parent has been garnished 1-2 times, I can't get a clear answer. It seems like maybe they got garnished in December for $118, then SS benefits increased for 2019 and they were garnished for a higher amount due to the benefit increase. Everything over $750 is getting garnished. 

* Parent thankfully sent me several pics of letters they've received since October 2018 (I haven't been contacted about this debt) and the garnisher says my parent has 30 days from Jan 29, 2019 to contact them about the debt or the debt will be considered valid.  Parent was never sued or served papers about this debt.  **Debt currently at $30k**, and the collection agency is getting the US Dept of Education to collect the money through parent's social security.  I haven't lived with parent for a long time and they weren't telling me they were getting these notices because they claimed they thought they could ""take care of them"" ...by doing nothing?  I don't know, but I'm glad parent finally told me about the letters so I can help, because I thought I had all of my student debt under control. I did not realize/forgot parent may have taken out student loans for me in their name only. 

* My salary is $28,500/yr before taxes.  I have a budget worked up and I think I'll be able to pay this off slowly by giving my parent the money and having the parent pay.  I don't have the cash to pay a lump sum. I have a mortgage with my spouse and I pay $450/mo. Childfree. Junker car worth less than $2k. No hobbies, frugal lifestyle, zero credit card debt. $12k federal student loans in my name that I'm paying and have been current on for years.  I foresee making a higher salary within the next year, ballpark around $55k/yr because I *finally* graduated with a degree Dec '18.  Applying for jobs every single day, so working on all advice surrounding ""make more money.""  
 

What I've done based on other posts to this sub / Plan of Action:

* Signed up me and my parent for the [National Student Loan Data System](https://nslds.ed.gov/nslds/nslds_SA/) to check for our debt there - nothing posted for either of us. That means the loans must be private?

* Both of us checked our credit reports on [Annual Credit Report.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action) which shows us all three of our credit reports for free.  The debt does not show up on either of our reports.  My problem is that I want to take care of *all* of the debt, not just a portion of it and I'm not sure if all of the collectors have contacted the government to get their money.  

* So, how do I find out all of the collectors when I can't even find the debt on our reports?

* I plan to call the collection agency who sent my parent the $30k debt letter via 3 way phone call so I can take care of this.  Can I ask for some type of loan rehabilitation to stop the garnishments?  My parent says they're doing great, and that they can ""afford"" these garnishments, but I am a scumbag for letting this happen and I know they aren't in great living conditions.  Since this loan is probably private what are my options?  Is loan rehabilitation out of the question?  What about payment plans based on my current salary and age, flexible for my anticipated increase in salary?  Is there any other advice you all have for me, I'm desperate to take responsibility and pay for my past mistakes....boy do I wish I could talk about fiscal responsibility to 20 year old me!

I think it's worth a look from folks who want to better understand how taxes work and not be fooled into thinking that the highest marginal tax rate is what you end up paying. I took a screenshot to show you. Just follow the dotted line to see what taxes you pay at a particular income level.

Also, if you increase the proportion of income that comes from capital gains, you can see that you'll end up paying a much less tax. 


**EDIT**: Alot of folks have said they don't understand what the chart.  If you are looking at the static chart image, it is fixed on an income of $115k and you can follow the dotted line up from the bottom and the number of bands it cuts through is the number of tax brackets you are subject to at that income.  The length of the line in each band is the amount of your income that is subject to the tax in that bracket.  The text box explains it.

personalfinance,FedLoan late payments severely affecting my credit.,"Good afternoon folks of PF,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on a credit improvement mission for the last two years and each time I embark on changing something I always learn a little bit more on why it works and how important it is to have good credit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started off at nearly 490, I was homeless for a long period of time after college and had no will power nor the knowledge of deferment/forbearance. After securing a degree and a job that has consistently gotten better in terms of salary over time, I have kept on pushing towards the 700's. Currently I am sitting at 674, with a +1 point change since last.

&amp;#x200B;

Originally when I found out what my credit was and how much I owed FedLoan, I paid off two of my four loans immediately and caught up on the other two. The total sum of all four was $17k a year ago and the current total of the remaining two is now slightly over $5100. 

  
Down to the nitty gritty, my credit is actually quite good - set aside from nearly 6 months worth of late/past due from FedLoan which has hindered my payment percentage. It started out in the 60's and has climbed up to 84%. I've submitted a request to credit bureaus, I have called FedLoan and neither are concerned with goodwill regardless of situation. Do I let these eventually fall off? The tow late/delinquent loans were opened in 2011 and have since been paid off.",finance

I hope this is an appropriate place to post this question.  I'm a full time student and live in a state that does have an income tax, however during the summer I worked and made most of my income in state that does not have an income tax. My income made during summer is somewhat inflated because they added on relocation income that was provided from managed housing provided by my employer. There was a tax assistance on that relocation income and my employer paid federal tax on it, but not state tax since I was in a with no state income tax. So while filing my 2018 tax return,  I owe a high amount of taxes to my home state because my income was so inflated. Was wondering if there was anyway I could avoid paying taxes on the money I made over the summer, or if there was any way to reduce the amount of taxes paid on the relocation income.

January, I started making $900/month payments to try and ditch them in approximately two years. Interest rates vary on them from 3.4% to 6.8%. I have $600 left on my last 6.8% loan. 

Now, I guess my question is, am I making the correct choice? Or are there better things to do with my money. I wouldn’t mind keeping the lower interest rate ones around for a while longer but I think the above 5% need to go.

personalfinance,Pay off Car Loan or Student Loan First?,"Hi all,

I need some advice regarding whether to pay off my car loan or student loan first. Here's the situation:

**Car Loan:**

* $11,274 left on the loan
* $204 monthly minimum payment
* 5.5% interest rate

**Student Loan:**

* $21,329 left on the loan
* $278 monthly minimum payment
* 3.7% interest rate

Since November, I've been paying much more than I owe on the student loan debt and I am paid ahead by about $6,500, meaning I technically don't HAVE to make another student loan payment until late 2020. However, I've continued to keep the student loan on auto pay for the $278 payments as it reduces my overall interest rate by 0.25%.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to decide whether to put a hold on paying the student loan debt so that I can focus on paying off the car loan in the next 6-8 months. Then, once the car loan is paid off, use the debt snowball method to take the $204/month that was previously going to my car loan back towards my student debt. By putting my student loans on hold, I'm giving up that 0.25% interest rate reduction and also allowing the loan to accrue interest faster since I wouldn't be making payments on it. However, it would free up $278 I could be putting towards my car payment.

personalfinance,"3rd Year Medical Student: 30k to Invest, No Debt~","Hi All-- any and all advice welcome. I feel like my situation is unique to most so I will do my best to explain which I think may be best served by breaking them up into categories(?)

**Medical School/Future Career and Earnings**

- Very lucky in that I will graduate in one year without any debt as parents are paying for my tuition
 
- After graduation, I will (hopefully) in a 5-year plastic surgery residency followed by a 1-year 
fellowship. Residency pays ~$50-60k with Fellowship paying more. 

- After those 6 years of training, will be making ~$500k a year (again, hopefully)

**Current Financial Situation**

- Parents live abroad and are allowed to send up to 100k to me as I am their financial dependent and a student. As a result, they are sending me up to that 100k limit and whatever is left after tuition will be my inheritance (as if I inherit it through their wills, a good portion of that will be taxed)

- I currently have 45k in one savings account and 100k in another. They will send me one more $70k transfer this year to pay for tuition (I know, fml tuition bubble)

- I do not have any debts

**Goals**

- Earn more than the low interest rates that I am currently getting from BoA

- Invest 30k into a longer term investment (would like for it to be available to easily withdraw as parents live in a politically unsafe country and could hypothetically move here with nothing)

- Learn more about investing 

**Current Thoughts**

- Invest that 30k into a Three-Fund Portfolio with Charles Schwab(I have been reading some threads on here and the BogleHead article here: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio#Choosing_three_funds)

**My Question**

- Is a three-fund portfolio the safest way to get higher interest rates than those offered by Savings Accounts that is relatively risk free, and easily accessible?",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing (Advise needed),"Hello, I have student loans with a interest rate of 7.9 percent that just kicked in.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, what is the best course of action to look for lower interest rate providers. I talked with my personal bank and they offered me a rate of 10.5%. (They didn't want to give me a loan truly, because the only thing I own is my car and they didn't see enough value in it to loan against.)

&amp;#x200B;

I have good credit scores. Usually between 720 - 730.

&amp;#x200B;

I know their are companies that specialize in refinancing student loans but I'm just unsure which providers are actually good.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,How to make the most out of a company acquistion,"Hey folks, I have a pretty broad question. I work for a company that is on the verge of being acquired in April (the Letter of Intent has been signed, now we're getting through a 90 day period of due diligence). My whole life I've lived paycheck-to-paycheck, so I really want to make the most of this opportunity. However, I don't  know what to do or where to start. 

**Here's what's up**:

The company I work for is private and is being acquired by a much larger public company. Currently, I hold 400 non-statutory options valued at $215 a share in the private company. I'll be exercising 80% these shares in April if and when the acquisition takes place. Two years later, I'll be able to exercise the remaining 20% of my options. Luckily, I'll still have a job after the acquisition.

Currently, I owe $8,393 in federal student loans. Besides that, I'm debt free. I live in the Bay Area and pay $1,445 a month for rent, and about $275 a month in bills. I make $72,000 a year and I don't have a savings account to speak of. I don't own a car or any property besides some furniture and my computer. Finally, I'm 30 and I haven't made any considerable contribution to my 401k in a long time.

I want to make sure that in three years time I don't look back to now and wonder how I squandered this opportunity. To this end, can you give me advice on how to use this money? Are there best practices that I can follow to give these funds a fighting chance of growing? Is it wise to touch any of it? For example, would it be foolish to, say, go on a small vacation? Or, should I instead lock it all away in a place where it can accrue interest?
Thanks for your help! I'm really looking forward to any of your responses :)

personalfinance,"Haven't included my student loan payments in any of my tax returns, am I able to claim previous years now that I'm aware or no?","Hi everyone, kind of a weird question. I (24) only recently found out that you're able to get a tax return for your student loan payments.  I've been paying back my student loans for the past 4 years (I didn't consistently go full-time) and I've gone back to see the amount of interest I've paid for each year since 2015 via fedloan's website.

Is this refund money that I have simply lost out on or is there a way to file for this?

personalfinance,Better to loan money at 10% or keep it invested at 7.5%,"Hi guys, I need someone to check my maths. I've got some money saved away and it's earning 7.5% with no risk (not in the USA). Generally the interest rate on loans here is around 10%. I have the opportunity to loan a portion of this money to a business for 5 years at +-10% (also pretty risk free). 

I immediately thought, ""Ah hah! Higher interest rate is more money for me."" but maybe that's not true:

In the first case I'm getting 7.5% compounded monthly. In the second case I'm getting 10% compounded monthly but on ever reducing amounts. Surely there is a break even point where the present value of the loan is the same as the present value of the investment. 

Lets also assume that I invest all the monthly repayments into the 7.5% account

How do I do this calc?

MATHS CHECK: 

For the loan I have a PV of -$1000 and a FV of $0 and calculate the monthly repayment. This comes to $21.25. I then invest this into the 7.5% account and calculate the FV.

$1000 dollar loan gets me future value of $1541 after 5 years.

Straight up future value calc for the non-loan option: invest $1000 at 7.5% and no monthly payments. After 5 years it's $1453. slightly worse by about 6%

EDIT:
Guys, I appreciate all the risk advice but I want my maths checked. I'm aware the risk isn't 0. I'm also quite familiar with the situation and what could/couldn't happen. I'm not talking about my life saving here, maybe the equivalent of a okay 2nd hand car. It would suck to lose it but wouldn't change my life any.

stocks,Your AM Global Stocks Preview and a whole lot more news that you need to read: Rally in global stocks taking a pause as major stock indices on pace for a third straight day of losses,"### US Stocks

* Market sentiment is dropping dramatically in the pre-market following an announcement that US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will not meet before a March 1 trade war deadline.  This came after Director of National Economic Council (NEC) Larry Kudlow commented that “there is pretty sizeable distance to go” in the trade negotiations between the world’s two largest economies.
* US stocks index futures are dropping with front-month Dow Jones minis –0.56%, S&amp;P 500 minis –0.59% and Nasdaq 100 minis –0.84% 
* The S&amp;P 500 failed to break above its 200-day moving average earlier this week, a key technical price level, which may point to a near-term cap to the recent rally in US stocks
* BCA Research, an independent research firm, argues that global stocks should remain directionless in the near-term as there does not appear to be any clear direction to market at the moment.  BCA observes that the MSCI All-Country index hasn’t risen or fallen for more than three months at any time since 2H2017.  The independent research firm believes this trend will continue given the vulnerability of stocks valuations to interest rates.

personalfinance,Deciding on Refinance vs HELOC to purchase an investment property,"I am currently looking to purchase an investment property with a budget of $90k. Right now I have a little over $280k in equity in my primary residence. I am 5 years into a 30 year mortgage with that property at a 4.25% interest rate.  The rental will go for about $7-800 a month. 


(All below are estimates and I have not fully shopped around yet. I have not had any credit pulls performed. Current estimated credit score is low 800s)


Option 1 Refinance:

I can get a new 30 year mortgage with 4.25% with $90k cash out and pay only about $450 more a month in principal plus interest. 

Pros:

* One payment

* Lower interest

* Fixed interest

Cons:

* Higher closing costs

* Would have to pay to get to 4.25%

* Restarting 30 year mortgage


Option 2 HELOC:

I can get a HELOC for $90k with 6% Variable interest with ability to interest lock at 7%

Pros:

* Lower initial costs

* Access to funds for 10 years without needing to refinance again if needed

* Funds available in case of repairs or upgrades

Cons:

* Higher Variable Interest

* Even higher locked interest

# (1) Quick Summary of the Industry

Cannabis is following the trend of what is likely to be (or close to be) global decriminalization/legalization of the marijuana plant and its derivatives. So far, much of the buzz in the industry has been focused on the Canadian space with the US and international buzz picking up as well.

**(A) Canada** \- has had federal legalized **medical** marijuana and marijuana derivatives for years but you needed a prescription in order to obtain any of it. Last summer legislation (Bill C-45) was passed to legalize **recreational** marijuana on the federal level in Canada. The first recreational sales happened on Oct 17th of this year, which means the doors to retail outlets and online ordering will be open to any adult who wishes to purchase cannabis. There is limitation in availability of products as the ruling bodies dictated that only “flower” or ""bud"" (traditional dry smokable weed) and oil tinctures/capsules will be allowed for sale to the public for the first year of legalization with other products to be sold after this time (vapes, edibles, beverages, and topicals like lotions, balms, etc.).

**(B) International** \- expansion is one of the major focuses of these Canadian companies. International countries are opening the doors one at a time as the ""domino's fall"" and either decriminalizing cannabis to some degree, legalizing medical programs for patients, or recreational programs for adult use. Most of these Canadian companies are expanding via foreign ownership/investment into companies there or setting up international operations as the doors open up in foreign countries. These Canadian companies are expanding beyond their borders and turning themselves into global companies.

**(C) United States** \- is moving quickly in taking steps towards legalization as well. I'm sure many US citizens who aren't familiar with the industry have noticed how many states are opening up in the same way as many of these foreign countries via decriminalizing or outright legalization for medical or recreational usage. The states have their own degree of power so they are doing this despite the federal legalities. I believe we have approximately 30 states that have *some degree* of decriminalization or legalization or cannabis. The US also recently passed the Farm Bill which legalized hemp on the federal level and allows for interstate shipping (vs cannabis which cannot be shipped between state lines). The US is also proposing a new bill (similar to many shut down before) to open up banking to US cannabis companies, which is a big deal for US operators.

Overall, Canada is federally legal and the starting point as many Canadian companies are expanding internationally. The Canadian companies recognize the US as a massive opportunity, but don't fully enter the sector yet so they aren't breaking federal law. There are many US companies operating within US borders (despite federal laws) and building up state by state operations, which has coined the term MSO or multi-state-operator. These MSO's and other US operators cannot expand internationally, so they are held back...at the same time, they are building up big operations in the US and are shielded from their larger and much more well funded Canadian counterparts.

FYI I got tired writing this thing so I didn't include as much information in listing the US companies or their operations like I did for the Canadian companies. Maybe I'll get around to it later on...for a great resource on US companies, financials, equity information, state by state break down, etc. [Check out this link](https://www.statesidecannabisinvestors.com/companies-a-z) and it was posted earlier to this [sub here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/angcv4/statesidecannabisinvestorscom_a_research_resource/). Shout out and acknowledgements to to some mods and other users in r/weedstocks but I didn't want to tag them yet again in the same post.

Regarding tickers, something to keep in mind is many of these companies have dual listings, which means if you Google them then you might see the Canadian ticker for the TSX (Toronto Stock Exchange) or CSE (Canadian Stock Exchange), but if you are in the United States you must purchase the stock off of their alternative OTC listing; there is no difference here except for being on **different exchanges** and listed in **different currencies**, but they are the **same stock** and perfectly in sync with one another.

**(A) Quick Rundown**

There are many ""marriages"" via partnerships and suspected entrances in this industry from big alcohol, big tobacco, and big pharma. The reason being that cannabis is a big deal and will likely cut into their market share and also the applications and potential of the products (more on this later).

Canopy Growth has always been recognized as the market leader and traditionally has operated and executed a step ahead of the competition and so far, continues to do so. Constellations Brands (Makers of Corona, Modelo, etc.) has made two investments in Canopy and thus far has [invested near 5 billion dollars into the company](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/15/corona-maker-constellation-ups-bet-on-cannabis-with-4-billion-investm.html), which brought legitimacy to the sector and is by far the largest equity stake/partnership to this date. The other most notable partnership IMO is Altria (major tobacco company) making a similar [equity stake/partnership in Cronos Group with a \~2 billion dollar price tag](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/12/26/cronos-group-benefits-from-the-altria-deal-in-multiple-ways/).

Other notable involvement and investments

* [Molson/Coors set up a JV partnership with HEXO Group](https://www.molsoncoors.com/en/news/molson-coors-canada-and-hexo-announce-agreement-to-create-joint-venture)
* [Budwiesers involvement with Tilray](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tilray-and-budweiser-maker-will-partner-to-research-weed-drinks-2018-12-19)
* [Apotex (major pharmaceutical company) involvement with CannTrust](https://canntrust.ca/canntrust-and-apotex-accelerate-partnership/)

This is all adding further legitimacy and hype to the industry. There are many rumors of other alcohol, beverage, pharmaceutical, and tobacco companies looking to get involved in the sector. Some have openly acknowledged their interest or ""closely monitoring"" things, such as Coke, Pepsi, Diageo, and others.

# (4) Consumption Methods, Medical Application, and Product Breakdown

So far there is the black market marijuana that we all know and love, dry bud, the grass, the dank shit. There is also the notorious edible brownies which hit you like a truck. So we have dry bud and we have volatile edibles...this is the black market world so let's start to take a look at the real white market potential here...

**(A) A Quick History Lesson**

Marijuana was initially made illegal in the US during the early 20th century, when hemp based paper (the non hallucinogenic “brother” of marijuana) threatened to compete and undercut traditional paper sales and was lobbied against successfully to make it illegal. Later on in the 60’s and 70’s, marijuana was used (especially during the Nixon administration) as a means to incarcerate minorities and successfully generated a very strong stigma associated with it through propaganda. This continued through the 80's during the Reagan administration and the later use of programs like DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) that were an attempt to stir up further fear of cannabis as a ""gateway drug"" leading to further use of harder and more addictive illicit substances. The international community had also largely followed the US in regards to making marijuana illegal. So in turn, this plant has never been researched thoroughly.

**(B) CBD &amp; THC** \- are two different products that can be pulled from the plant (so far). THC is what we mostly associate with the effects of marijuana and it's the psychoactive ingredient which delivers ""the high"". CBD is non-psychoactive and does not intoxicate you in anyway but can bind to receptors via fancy science I don't understand and provides a plethora of benefits and opens the door to a variety of application (we'll cover this later on). You can extract and develop stand alone THC products, CBD products, or products with a combination of the two. This industry is really in the beginning stages of research and more is being discovered about the plant as well as many clinical trials for a variety of issues and new cannabinoids (like THC or CBD).

**(C) Recreational, Medical, Beauty/Wellness, and Alternative Application**

**On the recreational side**, you have a large populace of people who already use cannabis around the globe. Even polls and surveys which show usage could be incorrect in their reports as the previously well established stigma often leads many to lie about the frequency of usage or whether they partake at all (I see this with many people in my own life). Combine this with the likely many people who have never used marijuana or any other products (possibly due to the stigma, legalities, lack of education, and/or inconsistent quality, potency, or cleanliness of “product”) and who are likely to experiment as things change...you have a recipe for a massive industry. This is especially applicable to the recreational pleasure from “getting high” from smoking, drinking, eating, or vaping cannabis.

**Beverages, Edibles, and The Future of Consumption:**

Many of the leaders of these cannabis companies agree that cannabis edibles and beverages in particular, will be the future of recreational cannabis consumption and make up a significant portion of total sales in time. This is often what Bruce Linton, CEO of Canopy Growth, has been preaching in press releases and in the media for the past year or two.

For those who are unfamiliar with cannabis or edibles...edibles can hit you like a truck. Picture drinking a mixed drink and not knowing the exact alcohol content. You don't know how strong the effect is going to be. You don't know if it's going to ""hit you"" in 30 minutes or 2 hours from now. You don't know if it's going to last for 2 hours or for 12 hours.

An important note on the matter of these beverages is that this **is not** in regards to a “liquid edible” which are already on the markets in some places (such as in California) but rather having a similar on-set to that of alcohol. This would mean something similar to drinking a beverage, having the “buzz” felt with 5-10 minutes, and then completely sobering up within an hour or so. These drinks generally **would not** be combined with alcohol and would be a set amount of THC and/or CBD and contain zero calories; this factor, combined with the anticipation that cannabis sales are going to disrupt alcohol sales, is likely two of the main reasons many alcohol companies have entered this sector and other beverage companies are eyeing the sector.

**On the medical side**, there many exciting things happening. Like I previously stated, not much research has been done on the plant until now. Many new discoveries are happening such as [GW Pharmaceuticals receiving approval from the FDA to bring their drug Epidiolex](https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm611046.htm) (a cannabis derived drug that treats a form of epilepsy) to the market. Many alternative products are also being developed to compete with the likes of simple drugs such as Aspirin, through utilization of CBD-based gel capsules to help with pain management or other ailments. Without getting too into the weeds on the subject (pun intended), there are multiple biotech and direct cannabis companies that are researching and currently undergoing clinical trails to get approval of their cannabis based drugs. We are talking about cannabis extracts or creams for targeted pain treatment, general pain treatment, arthritis, sleep aid, rest/relaxation, anxiety, pet anxiety and pain, and more. Even major CEO's like former [Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz has spoken to her investment in the sector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIA3ZsKsEfg) due to her usage and how much it's benefited her bad knee's. We are even seeing veterans turning to cannabis products for PTSD, trauma, and other issues and using their own cash to purchase them. Their usage of their ""free"" opioids (covered by the VA) is reduced or completely denied as cannabis works better for them. It was one of the reasons former speaker of the house [John Boehner joined the board of one of the larger US cannabis operators](https://www.acreageholdings.com/newsroom/2018/8/9/john-boehner-and-bill-weld-to-join-acreage-board-of-directors), Acreage Holdings. Overall, I’ve been shocked at what has happened already and even more so the pending approval and potential of some of these cannabis based products for general health and medical application.

**On the beauty/wellness side**, I see this as a sort of continuation from medical application. Every product imaginable is being combined with THC/CBD or other cannabis derivatives. Likely not all, but some of these will become significant in the future. A wide range of lotions, balms, sexual lubricants, libido enhancers, patches, pills/capsules, feminine products, etc have been or are currently being developed. In particular, some of the people in my social circle have been utilizing lotions and balms for arthritis and targeted pain management. In time, I’m sure we will see more development on beauty products as well. Companies like Coke or Pepsi are also eyeballing the sector for the concept of potentially creating products such as a CBD post-workout beverage (think Gatorade). Many former athletes are coming forward to exclaim how cannabis would have been highly beneficial to them during their careers and athletes like [Joe Montana have invested in the sector](https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2019/01/24/joe-montana-cannabis-investment-caliva/). in It’s also important to note that some of these products may come from hemp rather than marijuana. And yes, hemp and marijuana **are not** the same thing, but are apart of the same family.

**In regards to Alternative application**, I mostly view this as the potential outside of marijuana and closely related to hemp. Hemp has very strong fibers and has a wide range of application across multiple mediums. My knowledge is more limited here and the potential may be limited as well. However, alongside the legalization of marijuana is hemp being fully legalized (Farm Bill just did this) and we could see eco-friendly application for clothing, construction materials, biofuel, plastic alternatives, carpet, insulation, mulch, cardboard, etc.

So overall, what we are looking at here is potential application and disruption of the pharmaceutical, alcohol, tobacco, health/beauty/wellness, and other industries. To what degree exactly? No one can be certain yet...

**(D) Summary**

If you aren't convinced yet, then get convinced. Many people often have a hard time looking past the stigma of consuming cannabis and view it as a drug while associating it with laziness, hippies, etc (you know the stereotypes). Even people who use/used cannabis have a hard time imagining a future where cannabis is consumed in a non-traditional way such as beverages or balms/creams. Furthermore, even in the investment community has often ridiculed the sector as “weed grows like a weed."", ""It’s a commodity”, “It’s a giant bubble and a fad”, “These companies are grossly overvalued” etc. In order to understand the potential of this plant alongside the possible global decriminalization of this drug, you need to look past these mental blocks and see the potential. When you have people like [Danny Moses (Investor from the movie ""The Big Short"") investing in this sector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px0hs7RyT34), it's probably a good idea to look into what he is doing and why.

# The United States and Global Expansion

Many of these Canadian companies are grossly “overvalued” meaning that they are trading on the stock market for a much higher price then their current financials can justify. Some of this is due to hype but most of it is due to investors pricing in the potential of the industry. Legalization and implementing new laws and regulation is a slow process. Educating the public and reducing/removing stigma is a slow process. Research and development is a slow process. Construction of these massive grow operation facilities...a slow process. You get the point. This industry is moving very fast but the stock market is moving faster. As of this moment, sales and revenues are not going to stay up to speed with the valuations of these companies but the potential is being priced in as time goes by. This is slowly entering to more dangerous territory in terms of forming a giant bubble. However, if these companies begin to live up to their current valuations then their stock will likely continue to rise as it will likely always be trading significantly above their current financials. You make up your mind on when the best time to invest is (more on this at the end).

You might be asking yourself about the United States. The writing is on the wall as far as I am concerned and many states have decriminalized marijuana or approved some form of medical or recreational usage.The main issue with the US cannabis companies as it currently stands is the fact that marijuana is still illegal on the federal level...

With so many states having some degree of marijuana decriminalization, it’s creating a strange situation. Many US cannabis companies struggle to get a line of credit or access to loans from banks because they are operating against federal law. They also aren’t getting all of the potential tax breaks that they could if they were operating legally and often have to pay their taxes in cash. With cannabis becoming such a booming industry, this adds additional growing pains for these companies with little access to traditional capital. Many of these companies have to dilute their stock in order to get ahead (Basically paying for something by issuing more shares and giving up a portion of your company. This hurts shareholders.) This also leads to struggles around distribution and operations in that if a company operates in two neighboring states, then they can’t ship product across state lines. If you can’t ship state to state, then you definitely aren’t shipping anything out of country; the US operators are unable to expand outside the US by any traditional means.

How things turn out is a debate in the industry and I don’t believe we are far enough along to really place a confident bet on the outcome. There are some factors to consider when it comes to **US companies/US expansion** as well as **expansion into the US**. Many Canadian companies had some degree of connection to US cannabis operations; but they disassociated or divested in them likely so they could uplist to a more prestigious exchange (NYSE or NASDAQ). These exchanges won’t allow any companies to be doing activities considered illegal by the countries in which they operate. So generally speaking, most Canadian companies are going to be completely removed from the US for the time being. This may serve to some degree of protection in allowing the US operators to seize market share and establish themselves during this unique phase, rather than being gobbled up and acquired by their larger Canadian counterparts right now. However, most recently with the passing of the farm bill and federal hemp legalization, [Canopy entered the fray and is now building out hemp operations in New York](https://www.brewbound.com/news/canopy-growth-corporation-to-invest-up-to-150-million-in-new-york-production-facility).

In my opinion, the question of who is going to dominate the US is largely dependent upon how quickly these US companies can establish themselves prior to potential federal legalization (in order to make it more expensive to acquire them). The United States is a massive market and not one to be ignored, even on it’s own accord. This is also a double edged sword for US companies as the “protection” granted by federal law also holds them back from expanding beyond US borders. So the question evolves when assuming US companies take control of their native soil and hold it upon federal legalization...can they compete internationally with the Canadian companies who have been establishing themselves on a **global scale**, while the US operators have been developing on their own soil. Currently, my thoughts are more likely major mergers between US and Canadian operators to allow an international established presence as well as a foothold on American soil.

# The Current State of the Market as it Relates to Cannabis Stocks:

So now that you have idea on the current state of affairs, applications and developments, and an idea of the territories...it’s about investing right?

Do your own due diligence and check sources on any articles, books, podcasts, or other media you consume in your research.

**Some things you should know about the industry:**

To say these stocks are volatile is an understatement. If you think of investing as getting a 7 - 10 - 12% return each year, maybe slight 1 - 1.5 - 2% percent increases or decreases on a typical day...this industry may very well be exactly for you or maybe it’s not for you at all. Many people invest in this industry with the belief that cannabis is going to be on par, if not bigger, than alcohol. That’s big talk and with it comes big expectations and big swings in stock price. Traditionally this industry has been dominated by retail investors (AKA you and me) as well as experienced traders...not big institutions or hedge funds that might bring some balance and stability to these stocks. This means that cannabis companies stocks have traditionally seen frequent and sudden extreme swings, pending the equally volatile emotions of the investors in this sector. What does this look like?

Imagine doubling your money in a month only to see it drop all the way back or below where it was three months later. $10,000 can turn to $20,000, only to have it drop just as fast back to $10,000. Buying in with that same $10,000 at the peak of the hype, only to have it sit at $5,000 for months on end until the next big run...this is volatility. Timing is important and perhaps most important is having a game plan. I’m just writing this about the industry and investing in general is another subject, so I’ll leave that alone.

Be wary of the general state of the sector and the movement of these stocks. There are good times and bad times to buy or sell for different reasons. [Understand tax implications](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/aktljd/us_investorstraders_tax_implications_a_dirty/) and the different investment vehicles. **Do your research.**

Be wary of the garbage companies looking to capitalize on this hot new industry. Some crappy penny stock could just be some BS and it's a great way to lose all of your money. **Do your research.**

Be wary of the biases in the resources you do utilize. Subs like [r/weedstocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks) have notorious ""favorites"" or companies that a large majority of the sub holds in their portfolio so you see a lot of comments and pumps for those companies. Or (linked below) New Cannabis Ventures in which the news they post and share is from companies who are paying them for exposure (They aren't going to say anything bad about their clients or share good news about their competitors). **Do your research.**

Am I getting my point across? Do your research, educate yourself, and be smart. Lots of people lose money and consider the stock market gambling because they are foolish, uneducated, and/or highly emotional.

As I’m writing this, this sector has seen quite the bull run over the past month. Literally gains of 5-15% have happened every day over the past few weeks. Traditionally, this sector has seen the near equivalent pullback after a crazy bull run like this. That said, you never know when some big news is going to hit the sector and send it on another run. Generally speaking, the industry is always floating in a sea of rumors of other big names coming to the sector or big news to be released. We are also on the cusp of recreational sales being reflected in companies financials in the coming weeks, so this is really a matter of your own risk tolerance. These prices could keep climbing for while and you will have wished you had just bit the bullet and bought in or they very well could come crashing back down as they have previously. The decision is yours to make.

CryptoCurrency,"Celsius Network, pre-use analysis &amp; review","Looking for anyone with any experience using the platform, any conversation is welcome.  


Like many of you, I am holding cryptos and was interested in generating interest on those holdings.  In my search for generating interest, I came across a few options.  Peer to peer lending has come up consistently as a way to generate interest: though the platforms offering it have been straight scams/highly suspect (Bitconnect), or already failed (SALT, Poloniex).  


Then came Celsius Network, which promises a fluctuating APR on your holdings based on interest they have earned from loans.  They function like SALT, offering loans using crypto as collateral although they have better rates than SALT and are actually being used (whereas SALT died).  Celsius claims to have processed $630+ million in loans since July 2018 and has 16,000+ registered users from 100+ countries.  They are marketed towards enterprises &amp; individuals.  Interest rates seem to fluctuate between 3% and 7% which piqued my interest.   


The mobile app (no web app, just website) is solid.  Smooth, has all the standards you'd expect: 2fa, kyc, slick interface.  Also allows you to easily send cryptos to friends which is a cool feature (we're a long way from casually sending each other cryptos tho).  

&amp;#x200B;

The platform is backed by BitGo, a highly credible crypto security company with a trusted multi sig wallet.  The CEO, Alex Mashinsky, appears to be credible with 20+ years of businesses including VOIP technology.  They are partnered with Stellar Lumens.

&amp;#x200B;

Now come the things that have given me trepidation on putting my cryptos here:

1.  Centralized platform.  You give them your keys.  And as we all know, without the private keys you don't truly own those coins anymore.  If only Compound offered their rates!
2. Inconsistent messaging/lack of information.  In some places it says interest can be earned on XLM, ZRX, and other alts - they are nowhere to be seen on the app.  Spent 15 minutes trying to find more information and all I could find is that there is an email address for the alts - no instructions on what to say/how to address such an email.  
3. Another useless ICO token.  For the life of me I cannot see what purpose the CEL token serves, it's just another ERC20 that was used for funding.  Funnily enough it's hard to find any info on the token itself on their website, perhaps they've come to terms that it's just good as a funding vehicle.  


I haven't done it yet, but I will likely put 1 ETH here to test the waters.  Does anyone have any feedback using their platform?  Actual user reviews seem hard to find, which is an additional red flag but I grant that they've only offered interest on deposits in the last few months.

personalfinance,"Should I (22) pay off all my $24,500 student loan debt at once or continue with monthly payments?","I have $24,500 currently in federal student loans: $5,600 Perkins at 5% interest and $18,900 direct loans at (avg.) 3.9% interest.

$800 loan payment (minimum is $290)
$200 therapy
$50 gym
$150 food
$60 entertainment
$5 music
($365 commuting and insurance taken out pre-tax so this is factored into my take-home)

Currently I have $22,500 in my various accounts. So technically in a few months I would have enough money to pay my loans off in full and start building my wealth without debt. My job is at a start up and its a bit iffy at the moment, and if I had to get a new job I'd be making considerably less money (if i'm making $62k/year now, the jobs I would be looking for pay about $40k/year) because I want to get a job in the field I actually want to pursue a career in, not a tangentially related office job like I'm working now. I'm pretty sure I'll have a new job by the end of 2019 (based on how much I like my job/not wanting to fall too far behind for my actual career (experience is directly related)/start up risk).

I live in HCOL area, and would obviously like to not live with my parents forever. I'm currently staying in my brother's bedroom because my sister and I share a room and she is also living at home. When he comes home from college in May, I think I might need to sublet somewhere over the summer and then move back with my parents in September, because just three weeks in December when he was home from college put a lot of strain on me and my relationship with my family.

So there's a lot of variables that make the future hard to predict. Personally, I would feel more comfortable paying the $800/mo to loans and saving (I have an Ally account at 2.2%) the rest of my money now while I make a lot so I have more money when I end up taking a job that I actually want that will pay much less. But some people around me are suggesting I just pay off the loans in full and start building my wealth from scratch, debt free and that at my take-home rate I'd have $12k (if I stayed living at home) by the end of August.

Your advice is greatly appreciated.

Edit: I really want to stress that is is extremely likely I will have a job making $20k less than I do right now by the end of 2019. And with rent in my area most likely at $1500/mo plus utilities and internet, that would be 50% of income for the new job I would get.",finance

We are both actively trying to change our mindsets when it comes to the purchases we make (wants vs. needs), but definitely need some suggestions on how to budget effectively and reduce our debt. With our credit cards, we initially opened them for the travel points (which was great) and payed them off right away. However, we got carried away in the past year or so and also fell on some hard times and had to charge a lot of our expenses to the card. Our plan is to budget according to the current net income, and use the additional income in the coming months to make additional payments to our high APR loans (credit cards first). Also, there is no wiggle room with rent as we are locked into our lease for the next 4 months.

A few questions:

* I am thinking that the highest priority is to do a balance transfer of our high APR credit cards to a 0% APR card, because at 28% APR we are paying close to $300 every month. However, I don't know much about balance transfers or if this is even possible for us, so if someone could provide some information on how to do this, any risks, other info I should know, etc. that would be great!

* The high APR student loan #3 - what is the best way to get a lower APR? Should I explore a private loan through my bank or are there other options? 

* In general with the student loans, is it possible to pay off the high APR on each individual loan first? For example, see student loan #2; I'm assuming that each loan (a though h) is a separate loan for each semester. Can I somehow pay off the 6.55% APR principals first (b, d, and f) instead of paying on all of them? I'm assuming no but it's worth asking.

* With government subsidized student loans, is it possible to lower the APR? They aren't near as high as the private loans, but if there is any way I can lower or consolidate them I would like to pursue those options.

* What are some other things we can do to reduce our debt?

* Does anywhere reputable provide financial planning assistance (preferably free)?

personalfinance,In need of advice regarding withholding taxes on W2 &amp; I-2104,"Apologies if I’m in the wrong sub, but I’m hoping to get some advice on withholding taxes in the US. I’ve recently moved to NYC from the UK (married to a US citizen), and am due to start working next week. 

I was given W2 and IT-2104 forms to complete prior to starting my job and I have to say, it’s a little confusing! 

Based on our joint income ($158k - $90k for me, $68k for my spouse) I followed the W2 worksheet and put 0 allowances + withheld $248 per paycheck for federal taxes (I’m paid bi-weekly). 

For the IT-2104, I followed the worksheet again and calculated I’d need to withhold a further $58 for state taxes, and also claiming no allowances. Not sure if I needed to put anything for NYC taxes?

My spouse tells me that they claim no allowances either but don’t request any income to be withheld. 

We are both planning on contributing 15% each from our salaries to our 401k, so not sure if I should account for this before requesting money to be withheld from my paycheck?

My spouse filed their tax return for 2018 and received a sizable refund of $6k which I assume had something to do with overpaying taxes during the year so I just want to ensure we don’t have the same issue this year. 

If anyone could give me any pointers to ensure I’m doing this correctly that would be really appreciated!

personalfinance,Determining which is better in today's U.S. economic climate: Variable or Fixed Interest Rate,"Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

I (m22) am an undergraduate student finishing up my last semester at my university. I have done some work to determine that I need to take a private student loan to pay the last of my tuition and books. By my calculations a loan of roughly $6,000 should be sufficient. This will be my first PRIVATE loan I have taken and seek to have the lowest possible interest rate possible of course. Through research I have discovered that deciding on a variable or fixed interest rate largely depends upon the current economic climate. 

""Generally speaking, if interest rates are relatively low, but are about to increase, then it will be better to lock in your loan at that fixed rate. ""

I have no particular background in working with interest rates and I'm not confident in my evaluative ability of the U.S. economy today. Currently the best private loan options available to me are through Sallie Mae, Sun Trust, Union federal (funded by Sun Trust), Lend Key, College Ave student loans, and a state program called Self Loan.

Their interest rates are as follows: 

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,FreeTaxUSA mishandles federal SALT deduction cap in state itemized deductions,"Edit: *****UPDATE - FreeTaxUSA has fixed this issue as of Feb 13*****

This year I compared TurboTax and FreeTaxUSA and found that the latter mishandles itemized deductions in Maryland state. Posting for Marylanders and in case other states are similar, and since I’ve noticed a big push to FreeTaxUSA in this sub. Here’s the discrepancy:

Say I paid $11k in state and local income tax and $4k in property tax. That’s $15k total, but for federal deductions it’s capped at $10 due to the SALT deduction cap. 

To itemize in Maryland, instructions say to start with your federal itemized deductions and subtract the state and local income taxes used for the Federal deduction. 

FreeTaxUSA sees that I had over $10k in state and local income tax, and so subtracts the full $10k from my itemized deductions, ignoring the property tax portion of the deduction. 

TurboTax correctly applies the $4k property tax and only $6k of the state and local income tax to the federal $10k SALT cap, and therefore only subtracts $6k from my itemized deductions. 

That extra $4k in deductions is worth over $300 in state taxes.

I contacted FreeTaxUSA, but just a heads up if you are in a similar situation with that software. 

Edit: Response from FreeTaxUSA so far is that they forwarded it to their Maryland specialist and will respond Monday at the earliest.  Edit3: Got a response on Feb 13, with the problem fixed. 

Edit2: Here's the actual text from the MD comptroller's website about the issue:
""Federal tax reform limited the amount you can deduct for state and local taxes. You cannot claim more than $10,000 ($5,000 for married filing separately) for state and local taxes you paid. The new federal limitation impacts your Maryland return because you must addback the amount of state income taxes you claimed as federal itemized deductions. The addback is limited to $10,000 ($5,000 for married filing separately) and is reported on line 17b of the Maryland Form 502. Maryland will accept any reasonable interpretation of the limitation reported on line 17b. A reasonable interpretation of the law includes the following example: you, a single filer, paid $8,000 in real property taxes and $4,000 in Maryland state income taxes, Maryland will accept an addback of state income tax of $2,000 on Line 17b. In this example, the real estate taxes make up $8,000 of your $10,000 limitation and only $2,000 are required to be added back as state income taxes.""",finance

personalfinance,Question on Child Support &amp; Custody,"Warning : super long rant with a question about deductions and child support at bottom. 

9 years ago, my ex and I divorced. 2 children, 8 and 6 at the time. We agreed 50/50 split custody. Our arrangement was that the times he would have kids would be picking up from school on Tuesdays and having overnight, then they come back to me after that. Fridays, same thing - he picks ups and has overnight through Sunday midday. I get them back about 1pm on Sundays. 

At the time, he was making not much money at the job he had. I was making $400/week and child support awarded me $745/month in child support payments. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently brought to light the fact that I have been paying out of pocket in the last 2 years for a lot of stuff that I asked him to help me with. I got a better job 2 years ago and have been working my way up and doing a lot better for myself. 

For instance: both kids now have cell phones added onto my plan at about $80/month cost. I paid out of pocket for my son's braces to the tune of $6700 total over 2 years ($250/month) because he never went into the ortho office and signed up to take half the payments. I sent son to camp for 2 weeks in another state over the summer for about $2400. I never asked him to help with that, but there it is. I am also driving back and forth taking to school and picking them up from school and work 3 x a day between home and the neighboring city (about 15 min away) because the previous arrangement of his dad picking them up after school a couple days a week fell through. Apparently grandpa can't be trusted to drive my children because he's a daytime alcoholic. I'm also paying about $160/month for lunch costs for the school lunch program for both kids. 

Ex is not happy that I sent him an email spreadsheet outlining all the costs and asking him how he can start helping with kids lunch money, transportation, etc. I wasn't saying to go back to court or to fight him for more money or anything. I was literally asking him to have a conversation with me about it and asking for help. 

He calls me and in a nutshell says, ""You are getting what you asked for, so either take me back to court or take the salt with the sugar."" I swear to God, if I could have gone through that fucking phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

About three years ago, he switched jobs and started making a LOT more money. About $80K a year. I didn't take him back to court or ask for more money - he was helping out and the kids had medical insurance coverage and all that jazz. Great. I pointed out to him today in the phone call that when that happened, I didn't ask for more money, did I? He said no but I have been asking for split week to week custody (one week on one week off) for years now and you won't do it. (First of all, not true) . I HAVE been asking him for help with the braces payments (he didn't do), lunches, etc and its a no go.... ""I don't have any money right now"" etc but his brewery is doing quite well. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, apparently I'm going to have to take him back to court and pretty much ask for full custody. I'm tired of his BS excuses why he can't be there for his own kids and help me out with the extra expenses and such. Don't even get me started on the fact that he LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS AND DOESNT PAY RENT. He has his own brewery business and puts a shit ton of money into that. Thats a personal problem, ex. Not my problem. You don't know how to handle your money. 

&amp;#x200B;

He sent me a picture recently of part of his pay stub. He gets paid monthly. It basically said the following that I could see:

(this is first check of year for him, as check total and yearly total are same in both columns)

""can't see name of it/ assuming fed tax"": 1339.63

Ins-Medical: -168.32

Ins-Pers Ad&amp;D -3.74

Ins-Vision: -4.92

Optadd -9.56

Here's question: if there's THAT much federal tax being pulled from one monthly check, by my estimation (from him saying that he has the most pulled out as possible so he won't have to pay at end of year), he's making about $6500 or more gross each month. Would that be about right in a guess? Is there a way to tell? He says he claims head of household (because we each claim one child for taxes).... 

I'm trying to get an idea of what he makes gross per month so I can estimate what child support is going to award if I do go through with taking him back to court over this. Its stupid and I honestly don't want to waste the time but if he wants to be an asshole about it, then I will. My own gross amount each month is about $3800-$4000 depending on hours I get. I started paying my medical insurance $177/mo last month plus all the expenses for kids etc etc. 

Any thing that can help - advice - pointers - I appreciate it. I hate that it has to come to this - again.

personalfinance,Help with Adjusting Exemptions for Smaller Refund,"Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm set to get a large refund this year and I'd like alter my allowances to get a smaller refund next year. This year I am looking at a $3000 federal refund and a $5500 dollar state refund. I would like to end up in the ballpark of a $1000 refund for both my federal and state taxes this coming year. I have no reason to expect a large change in my tax liability for the coming year.

&amp;#x200B;

Federal:

My job offers a paycheck simulator that allows my to adjust my allowances and see the resulting change in my paycheck. In my mind, all I should need to do, is adjust my allowances so I take home about $77 more per paycheck ((3000-1000)/26). Doing so takes me from 4 to 8 allowances for my federal W-4. This sounds like a lot to me but if the logic here is sound, then that's fine with me.

&amp;#x200B;

State:

My state taxes are less clear. Following the above logic, I would need to adjust my allowances such that I took home an additional $173 more per paycheck ((5500-1000)/26). The issue here is that with my current allowances, my state only collects $96 dollars from me per paycheck. Since I don't qualify for tax-exempt status it looks like the best I can do is to claim 12 allowances on my state W-4 at which point the state would only be collecting $4 per paycheck, according to the calculator.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this logic make sense, as far as adjusting my allowances as stated above or is there a better way to deal with this? I don't want to end up one anyone's list for having excessive allowances, even if they are justified.

\- The only other credit agreement I have right now is my mortgage, which is always paid on time.  House about 400k value, mortgage balance of 150k.  Lived here nearly 20 years.  
\- I make over 100k.  So does my wife.  
\- We have only one inquiry listed in our report - 8 months ago we got a new alarm system.  Nothing else.  
\- Last car loan was 3 years ago, we paid it off early.  No prepayment penalty.  
\- No derogatories of any kind.  


  


According to lifelock they gave the following reasons hurting my score:

\- Available credit too low  
\- Balances too high  
\- Too many inquiries  


&amp;#x200B;

The car I've ordered is $46k.  I'm putting half down and financing the rest with the intention of paying it off asap.  Due to arrive mid/late march.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, my questions are:

\- Are lifelock's reasons 'hurting' my score reasonable?   
\- Is there anything more I can do to bring the score back up?  Over the last 12 months the score has bounced around +/- 20 points every month, centered on 800.  Nothing in my report ever changes - except the CC balance.  I don't get why the score changes.

\- Is it even worth worrying about?  Will the difference between 790 and 800 result in a higher interest rate for a car loan?  


&amp;#x200B;

Thanks.

personalfinance,Online payment for tax return amends,"I forgot about a 1099 on my taxes, for about 200 dollars out of about 106000 income. I filed both fed and state and they were both accepted approved and refund received on my end today.

Meaning I need to amend, so I'm waiting for the documents to be available on TurboTax, then I will fill, print, and mail the amende

Since I left off the $200, according to TurboTax I would have received ~50 dollars less in refund meaning I'm assuming I owe about 50 dollars total. Or whatever that difference in refund is for each state and federal refunds.

The question: Can I use direct pay for irs and California tax online pay and just pay what I assume I owe? Then update that on my estimated tax payments on turbo tax to ""zero it out"" so to speak? So the refunded amount would be the same that I got now because I sent the extra over. Does that not work? 

Or do I have to calculate how much extra I owe and write a check and include it with my amended returns (less ideal because I don't have a checkbook which is why I'm trying to prepay the owed tax online before I can amend the tax return)

This is my first year amending taxes and only second year doing taxes so I'm not very experienced.

Any help would be appreciated, feel free to really step by step walk me through it if you want to share some knowledge, it's appreciated. 

Thanks everyone!",finance
personalfinance,Need help figuring out what to do with an auto loan,"Hey y’all. So when I was 18 I took out a loan with my mother as the co-signer to get a car. We took the loan out from one of the dealerships partnered banks. Huge mistake, I know.

Anyways, it’s been almost three years and there is 5800 left on the loan in principle. About the same in interest. The interest rate is at 22.4%. 

Obviously I need to cut that way down. What do I do?

Edit: I did not abandon this post! I will be replying later today, very busy. Thanks for all the help guys",finance
personalfinance,Help with HSA and 2018 taxes,"I’ve been using turbo tax free federal for the last few years without any problems. My taxes are simple usually 2 W2s and some student loan interest forms. This year I have an HSA I need to include but apparently this bumps me out of the free version offered. Without my HSA It’s is estimating only $100 for my return. I really don’t feel it’s worth paying the $40 for the deluxe just for that. Are there any other places where can file federal that would include HSA deductions?  I’ve never paper filed before but that might be my fall back plan.

personalfinance,Should I pay down my car loan early?,"Hey PF! 

Long time lurker, first time poster. Very grateful for everything you guys have taught me so far.

I'm in my early 20's and am about to receive about 10k. I bought a new Toyota last fall (I know, I know. I avoided buying new - but pricier, reliable used cars were offering me 18% interest rates and I wasn't comfortable with a $2k beater car because I know nothing about cars and my dad lives 20 hours away lol - I plan to drive it into the ground though)

So I have 16.6K left on this loan. Should I drop all 10K on it? Or tuck it away into a high interest savings account? I've looked at other posts on PF where people ask the same question, and the answer seems to depend on the interest rate. I'm on the cusp at 4.7%. 

I have a small emergency fund. No credit card or student loans. And I make 45k at the day job.

Thank you in advance!!!

personalfinance,"FedEx sent my wife a letter demanding a Duty &amp; Tax payment for a package we never ordered, received or even knew about and are threatening further action.","Hello

Hope you folks can help me. As the title says we received a letter today from FedEx asking us to pay £16.76 for Duty and tax on a parcel. 

The thing is we didn't order a parcel or anything using FedEx that we know of. We've received nothing from them in regards to correspondence before this yet this letter says that it is a ""Reminder of Immediate action required""

They're saying we have 10 calendar days to pay it but tbh were not planning to because we didn't order or receive anything. 

Can anyone tell me if this is a scam from someone pretending to be FedEx or is this company just trying to take people's money for the sake of fleecing them. The letter and envelope appear legit so I'm guessing the latter.

Any help or advice would be great.

personalfinance,Update: should I leave my underpaid fed job I love for a 60% raise at a company with a history of laying off?,"Update: I attempted to leverage the offer at my current job and it failed. I figured if they could give something I would stay. The federal red tape for things like this is daunting. Meanwhile the company could sense hesitation and threw in a $20k signing bonus. 

I know it seems like the obvious answer is to leave but I am a top performer at my job and have a clear cut career path up the chain. My current management gives me nothing but praise and verbal promises.

On the other side of the fence is uncertainty. This company lays off at the loss of a contract and I can’t move since my wife is unwilling to and makes as much as me. There is little industry where we live so being laid off could mean a year or so out of work.",finance
personalfinance,Where to keep savings,"I have almost $15K in a high yield savings account earning 2% interest. This money is a combination of my kid's college fund and my rainy day fund. I know it is not a great idea to combine the two, but I decided to do so in order to get a large enough balance to earn the 2% interest rate.

My question is, as this balance grows, is there a better place to be keeping this money that would improve growth but not be overly risky. I have contemplated putting it in a target date fund for the year my kid would start college (about 12 years from now). I feel like I could be doing better than just 2% interest.",finance

My question--are there any downsides to trying to switch that money over to a high-yield savings account? Is there risk that the interest rate on such accounts would fluctuate to the point of yielding less than my TCA? Would moving the money result in getting hit with any taxes I don't know about?

personalfinance,Online interest rates Belgium,"I am a Belgian resident, I have a N26 account, which for me is easy since I travel a lot in Europe for work an spare time. I know they have interest rates (fixed ) up to 1,48%, which is a lot more than my standard bank offers. I am doubting to put my money in that long -term saving, since I'm not so familiar with online banks and actually a bit scared to do something stupid. On the ther hand, I know that N26 is a respected name, has German covering up to 100.00 euro and that it will be safe.

&amp;#x200B;

As a Belgian resident, what would be a wise online savings account that would get the best result? I am not really sure if I can do this with foreign online banks : can I deposit money from my Belgian ""standard"" savings account? Planning on leaving more or less 5 to 10k for a year or 2 to 3. Keeping in mind that the Belgian inflation is around 2.8% at the time, I'd prefer keepin as close to that as possible to have a good Net Present Value.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that it 's best to trade etc to have best results, but I'm not really familiar with those funds and market mechanism, which is why I prefer a savings account for now.

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning February 11th, 2019 [News, Earnings, etc.]","Hey what's shaking r/stocks! Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely last week in the market, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 11th, 2019.

# **Trade could be the biggest market catalyst in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/08/what-to-watch-next-week.html)**
*****
&gt; The earnings deluge continues and inflation reports are due, but it will be the tone of trade talks in Beijing that could have the biggest impact on markets in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin head to China, as the U.S. and Chinese still appear to be far apart on trade differences, ahead of a March 1 deadline on new tariffs.
*****
&gt; Stocks were spooked Thursday and were weak Friday after White House top economic adivsor Larry Kudlow said differences between the two countries are ""pretty sizeable"" and the White House confirmed there are no plans yet for President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping to meet.
*****
&gt; ""I think it's a very big deal, but I think this whole process is one to manage expectations, and the market, I think, is being set up for positive news. I think if some good news comes out next week, it will be a very positive event for the market. If not we could see some sideways volatility,"" said Don Townswick, head of equities at global investment management firm Conning.
*****
&gt; Earnings will continue to rumble in from names including Cisco Systems, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, as another 60 S&amp;P 500 companies report. Earnings for the fourth quarter have been up about 16 percent, but S&amp;P 500 companies have warned that expectations were too high and now first quarter earnings are likely to show an actual decline.
*****
&gt; ""Obviously, last year's earnings were supercharged. This year, what looks like a negative year in terms of earnings growth is relative to last year,"" Townswick said. Many strategists point to the massive corporate tax cuts as being a big contributor to the pop in 2018 earnings growth, which reached 23 percent.
*****
&gt; Besides earnings, there is some important data, particularly December's retail sales Friday and CPI consumer inflation Wednesday. Producer inflation is expected on Thursday. The inflation data will be especially important after the Fed indicated, following its January meeting, that it was willing to pause in its rate hiking and that inflation remain subdued.

# February Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 Up 11 of Last 13

&gt; February’s option expiration day has been down more often than not over the past 25 years with an average loss of 0.25% for S&amp;P 500. Despite a bumpy finish, expiration week as a whole has fared better, but nets an average gain of just 0.39% on the S&amp;P 500 since 1994 with 16 of 25 winning weeks. More recently, S&amp;P 500 has advanced in eleven of the last thirteen options expiration weeks. The week after, has been down 13 of the last 25 years. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar patterns over the same timeframe.

# Full Year Gains in 10 of the Last 11 Pre-Election Years with Positive January Indicator Trifecta

&gt; From recent posts and the 2019 Stock Trader’s Almanac we know that pre-election years have historically been the best year of the four-year-presidential cycle and a positive January Trifecta has also been historically bullish for the market. The impact of a positive January Trifecta in pre-election is not as powerful as other years of the cycle because pre-election years are typically quite positive however, the Trifecta does raise the ceiling. In the following chart of DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, the one-year seasonal patterns for “All Years,” “Pre-Election Years,” “Trifecta Pre-Election Years” and 2019 have been plotted. Declines in October are the result of the crash in 1987.

# High Yield Stalls

&gt; Just like the broader market this week, the rally in high yield credit stalled out a bit. Earlier on Friday, we highlighted the fact that the S&amp;P 500 ran into resistance right at its 200-DMA earlier this week and has been pulling back ever since. In the case of the ETF that tracks the high yield credit market (HYG), we have seen a similar setup. Coming off the lows in December, high yield was a little bit late to the rally, but it quickly made up any lost ground and has since followed the move in the S&amp;P 500 step for step. In fact, this week HYG even managed to briefly trade above its 200-DMA. In this case, though, HYG ran out of momentum pretty much right at the same spot (~$85) where recent bounce attempts also ran out of steam.

&gt; The fact that these rallies in both high yield and the broader equity market are stalling out right at key moving averages is no doubt a focus of technicians, but given the magnitude of the moves off the lows, they had to take a break at some point, so why not at a point where everyone was expecting it. The only test now is whether there are enough bids below current levels to support the market, or will sellers eventually overwhelm the balance.

# The Bespoke Report — The Resistance!

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 finished the week with a slight gain after posting positive returns early in the week and declines late in the week. Friday saw declines early in the day, but investors really stepped up their buying in the afternoon to fully erase what had been a pretty sizable decline. Friday’s late-day strength was a microcosm of the intraday buying trend we’ve seen all year.

&gt; As shown in the chart below, the S&amp;P 500 has rallied in the last hour of trading on 80% of trading days over the last five weeks going back to the start of 2019. Readings of 80% or higher have been rare over the last 10 years dating back to the start of the bull market in 2009.

What are you all watching in this upcoming trading week ahead?

Have a fantastic weekend and a great trading week ahead to all here on r/stocks!",finance
personalfinance,Financing cars; flipping them even or above water,"I have a car that I owe 10,500. The car value is 6,500. The interest rate is 23%. My monthly payment for the vehicle is 327. 

I have been looking into trading the car for a bigger vehicle and our car doesnt have heat. (A problem my husband thought he could fix) it ended up being a lot more than we anticipated. We would lay down between 1,000 to 1,500 on a vehicle if we traded it in. 

How do we go about doing this? What would you guys suggest?",finance
personalfinance,"Planning on buy a home, we have roughly $75,000 cash on hand for a down payment. Is it better to pay off my wife's student loans completely, then apply for a loan, or should we hold on to the cash for a down-payment on the house?","One of the larger concerns is the DTI ratio, and what we might get approved for in a home. Her loan still has about $60,000 left to pay off (at about a 6.5% interest rate). Currently we are able to save roughly $4000 per month, so by the time this whole process is done we'll probably be 85k-90k(ish). We were planning on dropping 20% down on a home to avoid mortgage insurance and get a decent rate. Our credit scores are both excellent. We are looking at homes in the 275-350k range (our combined income is roughly $125k per year, but she only recently started a new job 3 months ago, so there is the concern they might not consider her income as much as mine when looking at approvals.

But, we've been advised that we should just pay off the student loan, be debt free, then apply for a mortgage, but then we would no longer have the money to drop on a home to avoid mortgage insurance, and I do like the psychological idea of a lower monthly payment. If we paid it off, then saved for another 12+ months to be back where we want to be, considering the fed has raised the interest rate every quarter the last 2 years, I assume we are looking at at least another 1% interest on the mortgage if we wait another year, plus we are out roughly $15,000 in rent payments, so again, I feel motivated to want to buy immediately.

Is it best to take care of that loan first or should we buy a home sooner than later? Every mortgage lender I've talked to has given me conflicting advice and I can't help but feel like they are more motivated to close a deal than what is in our best interests.

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,"HSA, Taxes and Debt avalanche. Advice needed.","We're on a financial plan to get rid of debt. Goal 65k in 13 months (cc, IVF loan, student loans, car loans). We started in December, paid 10k so far. 


Fast forward, I did our taxes, we owe $1596 total between federal and state. (Already claiming 0, so I can't adjust W4s for next year) 

I have $2200 saved for that in a sinking fund. 

I did run the numbers and if I max out our HSAs before April, I can reduce our tax bill to $296.  

BUT I would mean putting us back a month in our debt payment plan. Feb 2020 instead of Jan 2020. 

Is it worth it? I hate the idea of pushing back our debt free date, but I also hate giving money to the gov. 

Note: we make too much to be able to deduct IRA  contributions (401ks available) , if I do this, it has to be HSA.",finance
personalfinance,Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund: Compound yield vs 7 Day SEC yield?,"What is the difference between the compound yield and the 7 day SEC yield on Vanguard's Prime Money Market Fund (VMMXX)? Compound is at 2.5% and 7 day is at 2.47% right now. If I am comparing this to the interest rate on a savings bank account or a CD, which one should I use?",finance
personalfinance,Roth IRA or Reduced loan payment with a traditional IRA?,"I am in kind of a unique situation and I wanted to run my thoughts past the community to see if anyone thinks I am missing something. 

I am a federal employee and I currently have $120k in student loans.  I am planning on having them be forgiven in three years (four at the latest) with the public service loan forgiveness program.  I try to make the lowest possible monthly payment on the loans in anticipation of them being forgiven.  Therefore I use the income based repayment program which reduces my monthly payment based on my income and family size.

 I recently realized that I could reduce my taxable income (and therefore my monthly loan payment) by putting money into our traditional IRA instead of our Roth IRA.  It seems like it makes more sense to lower my monthly payment by putting money into a 401k, but I am not sure if the tax savings later in life would be better to just keep it in the ROTH IRA.  Here are the numbers based on a few calculators

I plan on investing $19k per year in the IRA for the next four years.  According to a compounding interest calculator, four years of investing 19k at a rate of 6% would be $345,753.11 after 26 years (the first year we will start withdrawing).  If I put it in the ROTH IRA, the growth would be tax free.  If I put it in the traditional IRA, the growth would be taxed.  Assuming it is taxed at a rate of 10%, I'd pay about $34,000 of that if I put it in the traditional IRA vs the ROTH.

If I put it in the traditional IRA, the loan repayment calculator tells me I would save about $300 a month ($3,600/year).  If I put that $3,600 in a 6% growth account it would be $50k at the time of retirement.  So to me the $50k (plus the use of the money now) is better than the tax savings of putting it in the ROTH IRA.

personalfinance,Order of Credit Operations - which to do first? (US),"I'm a recent college graduate wondering what the best way is to boost my credit and refinance my student loans. 
 
I have about $45,000 in student loans, two of which have a interest rate higher than 7.5%, and two more have an interest rate higher than 4.5%. If I consolidated the interest rate would be 5.34%. I also have a credit score of 680 according to Mint, and 749 according to Equifax. I'd like to refinance the student loans because I think I could do better than 5.34%. I'd also like to boost my credit by taking on two or three more credit cards, (I only have one student card with very low credit limit.) 
 
My question then is do I wait to refinance my student loans for a couple years until my credit recovers and pay the higher interest rate, do I refinance first and apply for cards second, or do I do both simultaneously? My concern with doing both right away would be how hard it'll hit my credit.

We currently have 500K sitting in Capital One Money Market getting 2.0% interest. 

I'm thinking of a few different options and wanted to ask the community if there was something else out there:

1) Keep it in Capital One as they typically raise interest rates to match other high yield savings accounts (\~2.25%)

2) Put into 6 month CD at \~2.5% 

3) Move to Fidelity (our taxable brokerage) SPAXX which is \~2.25% (I think)

4) Move to Fidelity, purchase some other mutual fund/ETF/other that are mostly treasury bonds paying 2%+

5) Move to another Money Market that pays a higher interest rate.

6) Move to Betterment ""Smart Saver"" offering a 2.23% Yield.

7) Something else???

personalfinance,What to do with inheritance money,"Hello redditors on this sub. In November of 2018 my grandmother was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. As we prepare for her impending passing, her car is being sold to my oldest cousin, with a chunk of what the car is worth being taken off the price as a piece of her inheritance. The rest of the sale will be divided between myself, my sister, and my other cousin. The amount being $2250 each. Now, my mom wants me to put all of it towards paying off my car loan. But I dont think that would be wise. As far as current debt goes:
Auto loan: $5600 at 4.8% (5 year loan, 2 years passed, $165/mo with 0 missed or late payments)
Federal student loans: $2,300. Account is non interest bearing until 6 months post graduation(May 2020), but does affect my credit score. 
Credit card debt: $800, $700 of that being on my chase card with 0% APR until June. The other is a store card that I'll likely pay off when I get paid next week.
Medical bills: $1,100. Doesn't affect my credit score, $110/Mo
Tool debt:
Snap on: $350
Matco: $100.
Both are non interest bearing accounts

Now at this point, I've listed all of my debts.  As far as income goes, I recently got a significant pay raise to not quit my job as a dealership lube tech and work somewhere else, which will help greatly in the long run despite not being in school anymore for automotive. Pretty much all of last semester I juggled 25-28 hours per week with school. I basically was living paycheck to paycheck with all of my bills bleeding me dry, including constantly transferring money out of my savings to survive. I currently have ~$350 in a general savings account. My girlfriend and I are also planning on a vacation roadtrip through canada this August.

What I'd rather do is this: Completely pay off my medical bills(mom said she would give me a chunk of money to do so later, but freeing up $110 every month right now would be much more beneficial. Doing that would allow me to start paying some money towards my student loans, boosting my savings for myself as well as for a vacation this summer, or even making $220+/ mo payments towards my car.  Given that I'll also be working more hours and earning more money, I'd also like to be opening a Roth IRA and saving for retirement. Now as I write this, my grandmother might live to see the end of February, but that's very unlikely.  She has more money from selling her house. I don't know how much is left, nor how much more I may receive after her passing. Not that it really matters, I'd give every penny to keep her around.",finance
personalfinance,Buyer Beware: CreditKarma not doing 8962 Form to reconcile APT credits for Healthcare through Obamacare market place properly,"So if you're below 400% of Federal poverty line and you use market place  health insrance -Obamacare- you probably get help to pay for insurance  premiums via what's called advanced premium tax credit. Well, if you do  that you're supposed to file form 8962 with your taxes every year to  reconcile the advance payments of tax credits since you get help based  on your projected income the year before. Well, for 2 years in a row  we've been getting letters from the marketplace saying IRS records show  we didn't do this. Threatening to stop the help unless we file an  amended tax return to file the 8962. The thing is for those 2 years we  did fill all info correctly on credit Karma and when we check the  submitted return it does show that form attached to our return on Credit  Karma at least.

personalfinance,CD's for short-term investing?,"I have a good chunk of money (\~$50K) sitting in a savings account that I plan to use for a downpayment on a house in about a year or so. The savings account is literally like 0.05% interest rate.

I do have money invested in stocks, however I don't feel like they're a very safe option for money that I plan to use in the short-term. I was looking into CD's at Goldman Sachs and it seems like they offer one a 12-month CD at a rate of 2.75%.

I've never considered CD's as investment options before, but it definitely seems preferential to leaving it in a savings account. 

My questions on using the CD as opposed to keeping it in my saving's account:

* Is there a guarantee that the money is safe using a CD?
* Is [Goldman Sachs Marcus](https://www.marcus.com/us/en) a reputable bank / investing company? 
* Is there any better interest rate savings accounts / CD's available (at reputable companies)?

Turbotax, which I've used for the last 5 years, changed their fee structure following the GOP tax changes. They wanted to charge me for the form that  deducts my student loan interest.

personalfinance,Discrepancy between turbo tax and credit Karma Tax [MN state filing],"The title says it all. I used credit karma tax for the past 2 years because of how easy it was and it was actually free. I used turbotax before that and I hit a pay wall so I decided to look elsewhere.  


So come to today, it appears that credit Karma Tax(CKT) isn't totally correct for MN state tax. Earlier this January I was met with a message from CKT to the effect of, ""we are working on MN state returns, please try again later. We're working on it."" so I have been checking back with them every few days. Today I checked and they have MN tax filing up and running. After running through the questions, I was met with a big red ""you owe \~$2200."" wtf. my financial situation didn't change from last year, I was getting a \~$2000 refund from federal, and last year I got a \~$650 refund from the state. I dug into it a bit and decided I'd give TurboTax(TT) a try. TT says that I'm eligible for a \~$650 return. right on with what I got last year. The federal return was at about \~$2000 as well from TT so I can assume the CKT is right on for federal.  


It appears that CKT hasn't quite figured out for MN state returns yet. has anyone else in MN done their state taxes through CKT? I think that MN just redid their tax laws for this year so it makes sense that CKT, a relatively new player to the tax filing options, is still sorting out the kinks.  


I think I'll run through TT this year unless CKT gives me a better result in the next few days/weeks.",finance

personalfinance,Is withdrawing from my pension early as stupid as it sounds?,"Hello everyone,

As the title says, I’m wondering how stupid it is for me to withdraw from my pension. I am starting a new job which is doubling my salary (going from $40k to $80k), but my pension wont transfer over as I’m going from working for one state’s government to another’s. I currently have $37k in my pension, and withdrawing it early will have an overall 30% deduction (20% taxes, 10% in fees). I know it would be beneficial to place it in an IRA, but I have some debt and I would like to put all of my pension towards it.

Debt:
Car loan – $25k remaining, 2.9% interest rate
Student loans – $45k remaining, 4.5% average interest rate

After withdrawing my pension, I’ll have roughly $26k which I would place entirely on my student loans. 

Some things to consider:

My cost of living wont go up as I will be commuting and not moving closer to my new job (it’s a thirty minute commute).

I’m only 29, and I’ll be able to retire with my new pension at the age of 54.

My new job is the exact same as the one I’ve done for the last seven years, so there is a low risk of me suddenly hating the job.

I can afford both of my loans currently, and do not have to withdraw my pension in order to afford them.

I just want to be debt free as soon as possible, and considering my new pension, I believe cashing out my old pension will be more beneficial as the money will mean less to me thirty years from now. Is this just short-sighted thinking? It seems to make sense to pay off $26k in student loan debt if I’m able to.",finance

personalfinance,[CA] My withholding was wrong this year and I owe the Fed a good chunk of change. How do I fix this for future years?,"TL;DR: My wife and I have never needed to itemize our taxes, and given the standard deductions this year, our refund changed dramatically (even though our total taxes paid went down by $1k). Since we both have 0 exceptions and 0 allowances on our W4, me being marked as Married, do I need to provide my own calculations for with holding in the future? Both have us have always depended on our payroll companies to do it, but I think Gusto fell short (or maybe I did) this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Context:

For the past decade, I come out with the Federal government owing my wife and me a few hundred dollars, same with the state of California. This year, California owes $1450, and we owe the Federal government \~$2900. Running the numbers as filing single (I know this isn't close to exact, but for ball park), it appears that my wife came out with the Fed and CA owing her, and I came out with CA owing me \~$700, and me owing the Fed \~$3600 before considering any investment income.

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to know, is as someone who has 0 exceptions/allowances on their W4, and marked as married, just as I have for the past 3 years, why was my withholding so off? Do I need to actually calculate it myself (I always depended on Gusto and previously ADP to do this), given that my wife and I have never itemized out taxes, why are the changes so significant? Was this a mistake on my payroll department not properly reacting to the new law, or was there something I should have personally done (should I have marked myself as single?). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am lucky enough to have saved this difference per paycheck already, so I can pay it off, however I am embarrassed that this still happened, given that I go out of my way to double check these things typically.

personalfinance,"Moved states mid-year, double-taxed on final paycheck","Hi all, I moved from MO to CA mid-year and am having trouble with filing each state's return. My W-2 from the MO employer shows the following (fake numbers):

Federal wages = 30,000

MO wages = 30,000; MO withholding = 1,500

CA wages = 6,000; CA withholding = 200

My final paycheck from the MO employer was $6,000 for wages and vacation payout. This check was issued a few days after I began living/working in CA. My concern is that I seem to have been taxed to some degree by both states on that final check. Fundamentally, is that how it's supposed to work, or should I be able to recover the withholdings from one state by filing a part-year-resident return? Note that the MO employer also operates in CA and their address on the W-2 is their HQ in a third state.

For my CA return, I am asked how much of my wages were received while a CA resident. So I entered ($6,000 + entire wages from new CA employer). I then owe $400 to CA.

On the MO return, I can fill out form MO-CR which gives a credit based on taxes paid to another state. It asks for the wages I earned ""from the other state, as reported on the other state's return"", divides that by my total federal wages, and then credits me back that percentage of my MO tax burden. Here I also entered ($6,000 + entire wages from new CA employer), which nets me a MO refund of $350. 

This seems fair to me as I basically break even. However, my concern is: will MO look at my W-2 and say, ""wait a minute, you earned that $6,000 from a MO job, you can't claim that you earned it in CA and take a tax credit for it""? Even though I was a CA resident when the check was issued. Appreciate any advice on whether my approach is justified and legal. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Should I continue with my condo? (PHL),"Hi all. Lately, I've been thinking about getting rid of this property, but I'm still unsure.

I'm paying for the 10% downpayment of a $33k ~20 sqm studio unit right now. The downpayment period's for 18 months and I'm at my 15th month right now. I still need to look for a bank to loan for my remaining 90%.

The condominium building is still unfinished, pegged at around 80% completion.

**Background**

I got this condo unit when me and my ex planned to get married and live together. It was a bad decision--she left me for another guy and bailed out of the agreement. I was about to let go of the property when my high school buddy, the one who referred to me to this condo, told me to continue with the condo because he'd partner with me with this.

Months passed and my buddy didn't contribute anything; I paid the monthly $163 downpayment by myself since he was busy with his car. I had enough of this and cut off my buddy's involvement with the condo before our friendship would get sour.

Later on, my relative became interested and partnered with me with this property. From then on, we'd part all the payments equally and there was no problem after that.

**What's about to happen now**

By the end of the 18-month downpayment period, I should be able to look for a bank to loan for the remaining 90% amount. With interest rates in the Philippines from 5%-9%, we would be paying around $307 monthly at most, in 20 years.

Yes, we planned to rent this out but I estimated around $1500 to make this property rentable. 

I earn $230 monthly in my teaching job, and do earn a little more by moonlighting as a struggling architect. However, most of my earnings go to home expenses (which is another story) and I'm stressed out. I'm unable to purchase essentials--I do my drawings on a 13-year-old laptop. I don't have any emergency fund; if I'm hit with anything, I go straight to the charity ward.

Should I go on with this, or should I have it assumed?


TL;DR - Got a condo unit with ex, bailed on me when we separated. Currently partnering this with a relative but I have my budget too stretched out. I'm considering to have this condo unit assumed.",finance

Obviously not enough to retire, but enough to give me a great security blanket long term, and help take care of a few things short term. I'm a single guy, no kids. Currently, my salary is $57K a year (Actually changed to that today, was previously $46K), and I've been living pretty comfortably at the previous salary. 

  

Assets: Car and a house. I just bought the house in August, and obviously still owe pretty much the whole capital value of the house. I owe $63K on the house, and the interest rate is locked at 5.2%. I've had my car for a few years. I drive quite a bit, about 90 miles round trip daily. Because of this, my car stacks miles like a champ. I owe $14K on the car, and it's probably worth around $10K. I currently have just north of $2k in my 401K, since I've only been at my job for a year.

  

I've been focused on paying down credit cards, and before this was well on pace to hit my goal of having them paid off this year. Credit card debt is right at $3K. 

  

I'm really not sure what routes I want to take to make things more secure. I'd like to pay off my car, so that way I don't have to worry about it getting more upside down as it will likely depreciate faster as the miles stack up. Obviously paying off my house is a possibility, but I'm thinking that the interest rate vs rate of return on investments to make with the money now wouldn't be worth the gamble. I'm not struggling to make my mortgage payment, so keeping it doesn't bother me.

  

Then comes investing. I know nothing about it. I don't know if I'm best to put these funds in a Roth, invest in stocks myself, go through a broker, or find a financial planner (which, based on the wiki, is silly for this amount of $$). Long term, I want to have a more stable retirement plan, and be able to live more comfortably and do things I enjoy. I'd like to have a second ""weekend"" car, for fun and to share the miles with my DD. I'm not an idiot, but sometimes with money I can be. I lost my mother when I was younger, and my brilliant father gave me part of the life insurance payout. I was a 15 year old kid with $20k, and it went about as well as you'd expect. I'd like to avoid the same issues, and would definitely appreciate any help or advice provided. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on new car purchase,"I’m looking to purchase a new car at some point this year, but I’m not sure how to find the best balance between finances and my own personal wants and needs.

My current situation:
12 year old Toyota with 150k. Starting to experience some mostly (minor) annoyances. Nothing that’s is screaming I need a new car right now! But I would also not like to find myself in that situation   
My commute is 60miles round trip and I work   from home one day per week

My finances: 
100k in annual income. I max out my 401k and Roth IRA each year    
~5k in student loan debt - the interest rate is super low so I choose to make the minimum payments and invest the extra money.   
I can put down 10k in cash and plan on trading in my current vehicle 

The car I want:
Must be reliable, and decent on gas   
The cars that I’m looking at right now would be 25-30k including sales tax

electronics,Curated list of awesome Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for electrical engineering,"Following my former lists of awesome [CAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/cad/comments/8dmtc8/please_share_your_experience_with_the_available/) and [CAM/CNC](https://www.reddit.com/r/CNC/comments/aizatc/free_and_open_source_camcnc_software/) FOSS for mechanical engineering, I decided to also create a similar list for electrical engineering. However it turned out to be way more complicated than what I expected, taking two weeks of my free time to research.

I'm not gonna lecture you guys/gals about the importance of FOSS. I think most professionals are well aware of the advantages. From software licensing costs, privacy, cross platform experience, customizability and most importantly vendor lock-down. Just imaging Autodesk decides to triple its fees all of a sudden or deprecate a software all together. Your designs/documents are basically ransom to other vendors when using proprietary software! Also if you are a scientist and want to implement your own auto routing method or improved compiling algorithm, or you are a student who wants to do something on your mac or Linux computer without loosing your sanity over virtualization...

The way I categorize these software will be based on the conventional workflow I use for my own work (Robotics). Usually I will start with conceptual design including a circuit schematics and a breadboard implementation. Following by programing the Microcontroller (a development board like Arduino) and then merging the circuit and MCU in a prototype or simulation. Next step the PCB should be designed in a CAD suite and the Gerber sent for manufacturing.

I hope this list will stimulate FOSS adoption and help the community to better know of their alternatives.

# 1. Electronic design automation (EDA) suites:

These are the family of the software which try to integrate most of the PCB Design process in one place. They usually include the schematic capture and CAD parts, and sometimes even the simulation and autorouting.

* **KiCAD:** Is probably the most famous and stable of all FOSS EDA suites. It does not require introduction; if you haven't heard of it you have probably living under a stone :) what makes it unique is the fact it is used and supported by the folks at CERN. In the latest version it has some simulation (using Ngspice?) and some auto routing plugins.
* **Fritzing:** In my opinion is the most hobbyist friendly of all. I have read a lot of criticism on the forums about it though. What makes it unique is the virtual breadboard environment where you can place parts and connections similar to the way you could do it on a real world. It is great for beginners like me as well as documentation and publication.
* **gEDA** Is a combination of several other packages including gschem, pcb and Gerbv. It is the classic gold standard of EDA suites world. Its community is comparable to KiCAD and Fritzing, if not bigger.
* [**LibrePCB**](https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB)**:** Is an ambitious attempt to develop an EDA suite from scratch which outperforms KiCAD in terms of usability and extendability. Extensive libraries and version control are some of the key features. Reading from the forums this project has a bright future.
* [**Horizon**](https://github.com/carrotIndustries/horizon)**:** similar to the LibrePCB, is another attempt to make a better FOSS EDA and very appreciated by the community.

TinyCAD, FreePCB, BSch3V MINIMAL PCB EDITOR, MeowCAD, [PCB Elegance](http://www.pcbelegance.org), [Caneda](https://github.com/Caneda/Caneda), [diy-layout-creator](https://code.google.com/archive/p/diy-layout-creator/), [BlackBoard Circuit Designer](https://github.com/mpue/blackboard), [eSim](https://esim.fossee.in/home) formerly Oscad  FreeEDA, [myNetPCB](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mynetpcb/), [FidoCadJ](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fidocadj/)) are also some of the available options for those who enjoy investigating. Also if you care about programatic (aka code based indirect CAD), there are attempts like [aeCAD](https://github.com/aktos-io/aecad) and [SKiDL](https://github.com/xesscorp/skidl) to look into. Immediate advantages of indirect CAD are version control and object oriented programing, but it requires its own essay.

## 1.1. placement and routing (PnR)

If you have a design with lots of components and layers, manual placement and routing (PnR) can be cumbersome. There are some automatic PnR tools available which are either an standalone GUI/CLI and/or as plugins to above EDA suites:

* [**FreeRouting**](https://freerouting.org)**:**, on [GitHub](https://github.com/Engidea/FreeRoutingNew) or [this website](https://freerouting.mihosoft.eu)
* [VeroRoute](https://sourceforge.net/projects/veroroute/)
* [C-PCB](https://github.com/vygr/C-PCB)
* MUCS-PCB
* qautorouter
* [Graywolf](https://github.com/rubund/graywolf) formerly TimberWolf
* [Fairly Good Router FGR](http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/FGR/) and more has been listed in [this eevblog forum post](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/kicad/open-source-high-quality-autorouting-is-it-possible/)

## 1.2. Circuit diagram:

These are the software for schematics capture. Some might use these as a conceptual design platform, But I personally prefer to use pen and paper first. Then using these software is necessary for documentation of the final design. Some of them can also export different flavors of netlist (SPICE, Spectre, CDL...) to be imported to EDA suits, auto-routing or simulation software:

* XCircuit
* [YCircuit](https://siddharthshekar.bitbucket.io/public/ycircuit/) which is an attempt to improve XCircuit
* [Circuit Diagram](https://www.circuit-diagram.org)
* [QElectroTech](https://qelectrotech.org/)
* AACircuit

There also more general purpose software like Dia diagram editor, InkScape, LibreOffice (LibreSymbols) for design and documentation of discute boards. If you prefer non-WYSWYG way of design then TikZ CircuiTikz, METAPOST MakeCirc, [PSTricks pst-circ](http://pstcirc.free.fr/index.html), [Circuit\_macros](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~aplevich/Circuit_macros/) , [Cirkuit](http://wwwu.uni-klu.ac.at/magostin/cirkuit.html) , [lcapy](http://lcapy.elec.canterbury.ac.nz), might be your cup of tee.



# 2. Simulation:

Now some people might argue that thanks to the cheap development boards like Arduino and Raspberry pi, simulation is unnecessary, which I strongly disagree. For me personally simulation is important to reduce risks of damage on the hardware or even novice students, documentation, long distance collaboration...

The most well-known software commercial software in this category is the infamous [Proteus VSM](https://alternativeto.net/software/proteus-vsm/?license=opensource) which not only is very expensive for hobbyists and students, but is also only on Windows! Unfortunately there is not much in the FOSS world coming close to Proteus VSM in terms of stability and features. Mosts of the FOSS are either for analogue or logic circuits simulation or for MCU emulation, not much available for integrated virtual prototyping. However, it does not mean FOSS community has done nothing. There are amazing attempts:

## 2.1. Integrated MCU-analogue:

* **KTechLab:** is probably the most amazing and in some ways peculiar of all in this section. It is primarily an KDE tool for RCL, logic and PIC MCU (using gpsim) simulation. However it has a unique visual programing environment where one can develop the MCU workflow by flowcharts. Then it is translated into Microbe or MicroBASIC, another peculiar high level language of KTechLab. It also an IDE for C, assembly and MicroBASIC development and compiling (using SDCC?). It is unfortunate that KTechLab is still very unstable full of bugs. Another long requested feature is the AVR integration. There have been requests since 2006 to use SimulAVR, yet this feature to be seen :(
* **SimulIDE:** is all KTechLab wished to be. It has both PIC and AVR integration. However it is also not yet stable, more to be considered as a prototype.
* [**Emulare**](http://emulare.sourceforge.net/)**:** for ATMega line of MCUs
* [simuino](https://code.google.com/archive/p/simuino/) an Arduino UNO/MEGA Pin Simulator
* [gpsim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gpsim) used in both KTechLab and SimulIDE
* PICsim PICsimLab
* [SimulAVR](http://www.nongnu.org/simulavr/) which also includes simulavr-disp a TCL-TK GUI. It used in SimulIDE and is the gold standard FOSS AVR simulation.
* [simavr](https://github.com/buserror/simavr) is the newer AVR simulation which according to the forums is a very promising alternative to SimulAVR.
* [PIC-Simulator](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/PIC-Simulator)
* GNUSim8085
* µCsim or [uCsim](http://mazsola.iit.uni-miskolc.hu/~drdani/embedded/ucsim/)
* [MCUSim](https://trac.mcusim.org)
* Ardulator
* [Arduino Simulator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/arduinosim/)
* [emulino](https://github.com/ghewgill/emulino)
* [HAPSIM](http://www.helmix.at/hapsim/)
* [Kjwaves](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/kjwaves.html)
* gwave
* GTKWave VCD

## 2.2. General purpose:

There are softwares which are not specifically for EE simulation:

* Modelica Language and its FOSS implementations such as OpenModelica and jModelica are a great option for simulation of multi physics systems. The OM software has libraries for analogue, digital and logic electronic components. You have the option to use the GUI to connect the components or code your system in Modelica Language using continuous and discrete algebraic differential equations. The language has also been adopted by Wolfram Mathematica's produces, Maple and many more. It is just a shame that it is not already an industry standard!
* Scilab's Xcos or ScicosLab's SciCos are somehow attempts to replicate MATLAB's SIMULINK. They are indeed not as powerful but still great for students, teachers and even easy industrial simulation. Especially if you want to prototype a system and do not want to spend much time to code it, the visual programing environment can be a great help.
* MyOpenLab is also a great platform for visual physical system simulation. It can be considered an alternative to NI's LabVIEW.

## 2.3. Analogue:

These are the software which can only simulate the RCL and logical circuits. They import netlist files mostly:

* [**SPICE**](https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/projects/embedded/pubs/downloads/spice/) (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) which has been around since the beginning of time, is just for analogue simulation.
* Quite Universal Circuit Simulator (QUCS), and its SPICE compatible version Qucs-S have one of the largest user bases. Qucsstudio is also another derivative.
* Ngspice which is a combination of three FOSS projects Spice3f5, Cider1b1 and Xspice, is ""a mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator"". It is the simulation backend of most EDAs above KiCAD, Fritzing and gEDA.
* Xyce is also an SPICE compatible simulator for ""extremely large circuit problems by supporting large-scale parallel computing platforms""

personalfinance,Pay off my car loan or pay off my higher interest student loans?,"Hey there!
I have about $10,000 left to pay off on a 3% interest car loan. I also have a much larger student loan debt that I have not consolidated yet, with interest rates that range from 4.5% to 7%.
My plan right now is to focus on paying down the car loan first, as the car is depreciating in value over time. 

What I'd like to know is the pluses and minuses of that approach, vs focusing on paying down my higher interest student loans first. Is there anything I should be taking into consideration that I might not be?

Part of the reason for paying down the car is because I know I'll be able to do it within about two years, and those student loans will linger for at least ten more years. I have not consolidated because I would eventually like to focus on paying down the higher rates first (and the benefits of consolidation if I don't qualify for the federal pay off are not clear).

worldpolitics,Bezos and Gates,"Jeff Bezos is worth over 130 billion. Bill Gates is worth about 95 billion. They both live in Seattle where they founded their companies. Employees at both Amazon and Microsoft were caught in a sex trafficking sting while using their work emails and computers. The Seattle crime family are known for running brothels and strip clubs and they run the sex trafficking industry in that region with Frank Colacurcio Jr. as the current mafia boss. Bezos and Gates are using their massive wealth to finance human trafficking and bribing police and government officials on the West Coast. Both Bezos and Gates are pedophiles and worse. Researchers found that Microsoft Bing suggests child porn and provides images of it. Jeff Bezos's Amazon sold the book ""The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure: a Child-lover's Code of Conduct."" Gates also promotes depopulation through his vaccination agenda and says this publicly. This creep is using vaccines to cause deadly diseases and admits it. Bezos and Gates have been propped up by criminals in the DOD and DARPA to run two of the largest tech companies and act as bank rolls for human trafficking on the West Coast.

Microsoft and Amazon employees got busted during a sex trafficking sting, as they were using work emails to buy prostitution services.

Seattle has a booming tech industry, but its sex industry is quite solid as well. Some men spend as much as $50,000 per year paying for prostitution services, according to authorities, and it's an uphill battle to combat sex trafficking.

Seattle Sex Trafficking Sting

Newsweek reports that it obtained many emails sent to pimps and brothels between 2014 and 2016, documenting how brothels function and how people buy trafficked sex workers' services. To obtain the emails, the publication made public records request to the Prosecutor's Office in King County.

Sex trafficking of children, teens has been growing in Puget Sound area, experts say

SEATTLE -- As the flyers with Lily Christopherson’s face hang at bus stops and parks, new court documents reveal that police believe the missing 15-year-old has been forced into sex trafficking.

“She’s a beautiful, special, compassionate girl. She just needs to get home. Every day is harder than the last,” said Lily's mother, Lena Winters.

Christopherson is not alone -- hundreds of children and teens are involved in sex trafficking across Western Washington.
“In King County, every night there are 500 minors exploited, that’s a very low number, because those are only the ones we know about,” said Beth Podvorac, center director at The Genesis Project, which helps victims of sex trafficking. Podvorac says the average age of entry into trafficking is just 13.

https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/strip-club-figure-frank-colacurcio-5-others-indicted/

Seattle strip-club patriarch Frank Colacurcio Sr., his son and four other men were indicted Tuesday on federal charges. The indictment is the culmination of years of investigations into allegations of prostitution and money-laundering at four strip clubs from Pierce County to Everett.

The indictment in U.S. District Court is the culmination of several years of high-profile investigations into allegations of rampant prostitution and money-laundering at four strip clubs from Pierce County to Everett. Agents have infiltrated the clubs, offered immunity to dancers who cooperated, and bugged the Colacurcios’ offices.

Two years after exploding on three Seattle City Council races, a political money-laundering scandal led to criminal charges yesterday against Frank Colacurcio Sr., Frank Colacurcio Jr. and two associates in their strip-club empire.

Governor Albert Rosellini,"" Maleng said, or by the three City Council members -- two of whom were subsequently voted out of office -- who received illegal campaign money. Some of it had been contributed through Rosellini, 95, a close, decadeslong friend of the Colacurcio family.

Illegal child exploitation imagery is easy to find on Microsoft’s Bing search engine. But even more alarming is that Bing will suggest related keywords and images that provide pedophiles with more child pornography.

When researchers searched for “Omegle Kids,” referring to a video chat app popular with teens, Bing’s auto-complete suggestions included “Omegle Kids Girls 13” that revealed extensive child pornography when searched. And if a user clicks on those images, Bing showed them more illegal child abuse imagery in its Similar Images feature. Another search for “Omegle for 12 years old” prompted Bing to suggest searching for “Kids On Omegle Showing,” which pulled in more criminal content.

I don't mind down grading as I've been wanting a truck and don't mind something older. I'm looking to do something like this because then I can continue putting in that money into savings  and really gather a good downpayment for a home.   

Am I completely off base here in wanting to do this and better to just stick with that I have?

personalfinance,My graduate school's financial aid / tax practices seem odd and I'd like to hear your thoughts,"I'm a graduate student, and I receive a scholarship that pays full tuition plus a stipend. The way my school has handled financial aid feels shady, but I'd like your input because taxes and their related financial documentation are not my areas of expertise.

For starters, my stipend for the full academic year is $34,000. I received it via two direct deposits to my bank account (both arrived during 2018). It was not taxed, and my college didn't list it on any financial/tax documents I was given. It's not listed on the 1098-T, I was not given a W-2... nothing. The only evidence I have is the two direct deposits. When the students who received stipends asked the college about taxes, we were told that the college does not provide tax advice and that was the end of the conversation.

Additionally, I was given an incorrect 1098-T as far as I can tell. ""Payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses"" is listed as $14,034.00 while ""Scholarships or grants "" is listed as $13,824.00. I paid a total of $426 in fees to the college for the fall semester... quite a bit less than $14,034.00. Tuition for the fall semester is listed as $21,240.00 in my first bill, so the college actually paid well over $13,824.00. Everyone else that's on the same scholarship as me also have messed up 1098-T forms.

I plan on reporting the $34,000 stipend since it wasn't for qualified educational expenses, and I'm not one to funnel 34k into the Cayman Islands. Is the way my college handled scholarships and stipends sketchy? I was given almost zero financial documentation, and what I was given is wrong (I think). Where do I even go from here? Thanks for any and all input.

Edit: perhaps I should mention, all of this money is coming from a federal grant given to my college, who then gives the money to me.",finance

I paid it off fully almost 2 years ago and it now has about 110k miles.  Ever since 2016, I've been battling problems with the A/C system.  I think at this point I've put about $2.5k total into A/C repairs, and it's looking like there might be \*another\* problem with the evaporator core, or something else internally.  This would require ripping the entire dash out, which is labor intensive and will run upwards of $1k.

I was looking at used cars at first.  Focus hatchs, Accords, Civics, Camrys, Corollas, etc.  I started seriously looking at a used 2018 Corolla with 10k miles for $15k.  Adaptive cruise control sounds amazing for my commute, and it should be a reliable car that's worth the investment.  But here's the thing...I just don't feel happy spending this much money on a car I don't even particularly like.  I really want a hatchback or a crossover.  Lack of space has been my biggest complaint about my car, other than the fact that I'm always drenched in sweat by the time I arrive at work.

So I started looking at things that are slightly bigger: the Corolla hatchback, Subaru Impreza hatch, and Subaru Crosstrek.  The Corolla and Impreza seem the more practical due to lower cost and better MPGs.  I'm guessing the Corolla might be somewhat more of a long term value than the Impreza, plus Adaptive Cruise Control comes standard on all 2017+ Corollas.  But the thing about the Corolla hatchback is that it was new for model year 2019 and there are hardly any available used.   There are used Subarus around but finding one at a reasonable mileage and cost with EyeSight equipped has been somewhat tough.

I'd probably end up spending $22-24k on a Corolla or Impreza, or more like $26k on a Crosstrek.  It seems a lot more palatable than spending $15k on a used, mostly sidegrade car I won't even particularly enjoy.  If I'm being foolish, please convince me of that",finance

personalfinance,Financial Advice Sought,"Background:  I’m a 50 year-old male coming off a horrific year-long divorce that ended up going to trial, where I received a very favorable ruling.  I’m trying to pick up the pieces of my finances and determine a feasible path forward.

Details:

- As a result of the divorce, I lost my low six-figure job in May of 2018 and was out of work until starting a new job in January 2019.  I netted approximately $2,500 per month in unemployment streams until my benefit expired at the end of 2018.  My new job was a step up in responsibilities (went from regional sales manager to national sales manager) but a step down in guaranteed pay.  I’m receiving a base salary of $80k, but have a significant bonus tied to company performance, which is paid at the end of the calendar year.  I’m expecting to earn an additional $20k - $40k in bonus, but that’s neither guaranteed nor coming due for many months.

- My ex and I own two homes and I was awarded the larger of the two homes in the final divorce ruling.  This home has a market value of approximately $1.3 million and has approximately $160k remaining on the mortgage.  Monthly mortgage payments are $2,200 at the 3.25% interest rate on the home loan.

- I was awarded child support payments of $1k per month from my ex to be paid to me until the kids are 18 (four more years).  This was a unique component of the final ruling based upon my ex’s role in the loss of my last job, which I won’t go into further.

- I have a Schwab Roth IRA with just over $100k in it.  I have resisted dipping into this due to the stiff early-withdrawal penalties and now that I’m back to earning at near-historical levels I’m hoping to be able to stay afloat with monthly mortgage payment and normal bills.

- I have two credit cards with combined balances of approximately $60k which are almost entirely a result of attorney fees.  Both cards have typical APR’s, so I am paying hundreds of dollars in interest charges each month.

- In January 2019 I applied for a $50k personal loan with my bank to help pay down my credit card balances.  At this time I had just received the job offer (which I presented to the bank) but hadn’t started my new job yet.  The bank denied my loan request, citing my high credit card balances as the reason.  The home that I was awarded in the divorce ruling had not yet been quit claim deeded into my name, so I was not able to qualify for a secured loan.  The quit claim deed should finally be executed within the next couple of weeks, so I'm trying to have a game plan in place just as soon my ex's name is off the title to my house.

- My credit score one year ago was 751.  When my credit score was re-run by the bank considering the loan, it had dipped to 731 (surely as a result of the high credit card balances).  I have zero history of late payments or loan defaults.

- Other than my Roth IRA, I have a couple thousand dollars in my checking account as a result of my first paycheck from my new company.  My car is paid for and I have no other debt other than normal monthly bills.

Inquiry:

- I’m going to need to be able to refinance the home I was awarded within twelve months (per the court order), and after my personal loan was denied I’m freaking out that I’m going to have a difficult time doing this.  Given my background, will I be able to refinance without having to sell the home?  Having my parents co-sign on the refinancing is a possibility, but I’d hate to have to ask them to do this.

- With my lower guaranteed earnings in my new job, does it seem like I’ll be able to afford to keep my home rather than being forced to sell it?  I have very simple means and don’t need fancy cars or lavish vacations and am planning on continuing to live very frugally, but this is my dream home and I would be devastated if I was forced to sell it.

- I’m getting clobbered with credit card interest charges and am highly motivated to get my balances paid down.  Once the home has been quit claim deeded to me, will I be able to qualify for a secured loan to allow me to pay down these balances?

- Do I dare tap into my Roth IRA to free up money to pay down my credit cards?  I’m a financial novice (my ex is a CPA and handled all of our finances) and could probably use a session with a local financial planner, but I’ve been hesitant to shell out money that I don’t currently have to do this.

personalfinance,What to do with SO's Student Loans?,"Hello PF. My wife and I have made 2019 the year we take charge of our finances. Our first child is due in May and we've been working through merging our accounts and aligning our financial plans. We have grand designs of hopefully owning a single family home some day (hah). In digging through our finances, the biggest obstacle we're going to have are her student loans, which I've just recently started reviewing (I was aware they existed, but we've kept finances separate until now so they were always her problem, rather than my problem, in my mind (not in reality of course)). I, having never taken out student loans or attended college am a bit under-informed about student loans, and was hoping I could get some confirmation we're on the right track of how to tackle them best. If I've missed anything major that I need to get informed opinions, please let me know and I will edit them in. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife has approx $39,450 federal Stafford student loans. There appear to be 9 different loans, roughly half of them subsidized and the other half not subsidized. 8 out of the 9 loans have a 6.8% interest rate, the remaining loan has a 6% interest rate. About 17000 of the total loan amount reside in two loans that paid for grad school, the rest are between 1.5-3k each. It appears looking over her loan information most of what she's paid back this far has been interest. The current payment plan they are on has them being dealt with by 2035 and paying another 35,000 in interest, obviously that's out of the question. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background info on us:

Wife: Master's in Education, employed as a public school teacher (elementary) Annual Salary: 60,000. Job stability: very stable. Credit Score 760.

Me: No degree, 12+ years in IT, numerous certifications, government contractor. Annual Salary: 120,000. Job stability: pretty stable (I've worked for the same agency under numerous contractors, have lots of good contracts, and am qualified for numerous IT jobs which are very prevalent where we live, not as stable as my wife's employment, but not something that I worry about either.) Credit Score 720.

We have a small amount of credit card debt at 0% interest which we have budged to pay off before the promotional rate ends. We do not have car loans, and no other outstanding debts. Emergency Fund big enough. 

In reviewing her loans, it's unlikely she will qualify for teacher loan forgiveness (Does not work in an eligible school). From my understanding it's possible she could qualify for PSLF (she has been working as a teacher from 2013, which would give her 5 soon to be 6 years of service) at the 10 year mark. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think this leaves us with two options and I'm looking for advice on them:

1) Verify she has been working toward PSLF - continue to pay the minimum on the loans until PSLF kick in, while saving money not put toward loans for house/retirement/other expenses.

2) Refinance the loans at a better rate on a 5 year plan - Overpay significantly with the objective of having them paid off in less than 2.5 years. Reduce future savings to the minimum (emergency fund + 401k match level) to allow for over payment on the loans. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone had any experience with PSLF - is there a way to verify / get credit for the time shes worked already. Is there a way of lowering her interest rates on the loans without disqualifying her from PSLF if she was eligible before? (I know privately refinancing them disqualifies her).

&amp;#x200B;

If we decide to go the refinance route, does it make more sense for us to get a variable rate loan given our stability &amp; ability / plan to overpay the loans significantly to payoff before the original loan payoff date?

personalfinance,"Looking for advice for family of 6, age 34, no retirement, 75k student loans, some home equity","Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

Been a lurker here for awhile.  Turning some ideas around for my family's future and we have some options, so I wanted to paint the picture for you all and ask for advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Since June of 2018, my family of 6 has lived with my parents free of rent/most expenses so that we could focus on paying off debt ASAP.    Since moving in with parents, we have thrown all extra income at our medical/cc debt and just last month paid off the last of it.  We've been renting out our house that we owe \~127k out of 145k on and are about 2 years into the 15 year term (3.4% interest).  Our home appears to be worth around 175k (\~50k equity) at current market value and is our only real asset (I have no retirement to speak of, no savings yet either).

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from our mortgage, what remains of our debt is \~75k student loans, average interest rate about 6.5%.  By the time we move out from my parents' and back into our home, we will have saved about 10k in emergency funds.  I make about 80k per year and my dad has agreed to gift us 40k over the next 5 years to help pay off the student loan debt, so without any major changes we will have those loans paid off within the next 5 years (between my dad's generous gift and our own funds (debt snowball about $1500 per month).

&amp;#x200B;

The question I have for you guys is regarding the next few years...should we:

a.  Sell the house and use the proceeds (\~30-40k) to pay off student loans quicker?  Opening up the idea that we could save for retirement much faster (possibly within a year or so, rather than 5).  We aren't married to the home, it's nice but not our dream home, and in this scenario we could find rentals that are similar to our mortgage per month that would meet our needs.

&amp;#x200B;

b.  Keep the house and live in it for another 5-10 years before moving out and holding on to it as a rental property, which would generate \~1k per month passive income in 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

c.  Something else?   Open to any and all ideas!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning toward option a., since I feel that we are pretty far behind the curve and this would help use at least get to the point where we are breaking even, can start accumulating wealth rather than perpetually being in the red.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear your thoughts, let me know if you need any more info, thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: more info on the home/living situation:

In 2009 we bought the home that we are renting out currently while we live with my parents.  We will live with my parents from June 2018-July 2019.   When we bought the home in 2009 for 145k, it was a 30 year mortgage, then I stupidly refinanced it a couple years ago to be a 15 year mortgage.

personalfinance,Deductions and exemptions as a foreign national non-resident temp worker on 1040NR-EZ tax return,"I've posted this in a few places but have struggled to find an answer so I thought I would try here. I've got 99% of my tax information sorted, i'm just stuck on this last bit.

I'm on a 5 year J1 work visa as a research scholar and I've just completed my first year of employment in the USA so I need to do my taxes. I'm a UK citizen but won't be claiming tax treaty exemption as I plan on being here the full 5 years (at least).

Just a small thing to clear up first: from my reading I can see that I don't get the standard exemption of $12000 because I am not a resident (I believe I automatically become 'resident' after my 2nd year so I gain standard exemption but start paying FICA taxes, in the end federal+state tax decrease and FICA tax increase even out and my paycheck barely changes). I can only take itemized exemptions and the only one I can currently take due to tax laws is state tax paid deduction. I paid $X in state tax but my doing my taxes now I see my bill works out as $X+500 so I underpaid $500 and need to pay more. Do I go back to my federal tax form with this higher state tax number to work out my exemption? Or use the total state tax paid from my W2 as the exemption on my 1040NR-EZ? I guess the extra $500 i'm going to pay in 2019 for my underpaid 2018 state tax will be on my 2019 tax return?

The main thing: I see that **exemptions** and **deductions** are different. I think I can also **deduct** student loan interest from my gross income, separate to the state tax **exemption**. Is his correct? So I can remove **up to** $2500 from my gross income for tax calculation purposes (so not pay tax on that $2500?) for however much interest I paid on my student loans? My student loans are British and from the government or big banks and went to big UK universities which are recognized by the USA (FAFSA numbers). It seems strange that a tax form for foreign nationals temporarily earning money in the USA has a box for student loan interest specifically when all other deduction/exemptions are quite aggressively removed.

I've searched extensively on this subject and not found anything which says the loans need to be in the USA. On a few of the free tax program forums posts say I can, but on a specialist immigration forum one person said they asked 3 CPAs and they all said no (a few years ago). However, I called the IRS number and spoke to someone about tax law. The lady asked me a few questions about my personal circumstances, loan, and income, and said ""I can advise you that the tax saw says you **CAN** deduction your student loan interest"". I also spoke to a VITA volunteer and she said ""I don't see any reason why not"" although she didn't sound confident. The interest deduction box isn't itemized and the lady from the IRS said not to include any extra forms or data, and that if the IRS want any further information then they'll ask for it later. So I guess I go for it and then if I get told later that I can't do it then I scratch it out and point out that I was instructed by two IRS representatives that I should do it. The worst that could happen is that my federal tax refund it delayed a couple weeks, right?

Does anyone have any personal experience in this? Have any foreign nationals ever claimed student loan interest on their 1040NR? If you believe that I cannot do this then could you show me the piece of law which says I can't?

Thank you

Trying to get a better hold on my bills and finances so I can make my first steps towards getting my money right and not living paycheck to paycheck. I'm 38, I make a little under 30k a year before taxes and my credit score is in the low 500s. I'm trying to remedy this.

Starting this month, I am paying the majority of my bills with it my Secured Card, and then plan on just paying the Card off every month. 

My dilemma is how to go about doing this. I get paid Weekly, and I made a 2nd Checking account specifically to hold my rent and bills money, this is the account that my Credit Card payments will come from. Every week when I get paid, the Rent and Credit Card money will be auto-transferred to the 2nd checking account, leaving the rest for spending. However the only automated option for actually paying on the Credit Card from this account is Monthly. 

My Account Statement closing is usually the 21st and my due date is usually the 18th of the following month. I make at least my minimum if not more immediately after I receive the bill. I haven't missed a minimum payment since I got the card in March 2018, and I've paid it all the way down several times,  but it's been close to maxed out a lot more than I'd like and I'm trying to course-correct. 


Would it be better to just make 1 automated payment of $500 every month on say the 16th, or to manually pay $125 on the card every week? (For the record most my my essential bills are due around the 15th) Either way, the goal is to have the Card as close to Zero Balance as I can by the 21st of each month while the Card itself is used to autopay my bills. 

Is this even a good plan to begin with?",finance

worldpolitics,Chicago Outfit and the Democratic Party,"The Chicago Outfit is still a major organized crime syndicate in the United States. The Chicago Outfit runs the Las Vegas casinos and use the cash flow for laundering their criminal profits. They control Vegas through the Nevada Gaming Commission and politicians like former Mayor of Las Vegas and defense attorney for the mobsters Oscar Goodman and his wife Carolyn Goodman who is the current Mayor of Vegas. The Chicago Mob have many organized crime associates who are Jewish and used as their front men to manage their businesses in Vegas and Hollywood like Frank Rosenthal who was from Chicago and ran various casinos in Nevada. They made a movie about it called Casino. Oscar Goodman worked as a defense attorney for mobsters including Frank Rosenthal and he was the mayor of Las Vegas from 1999 to 2011 and his wife Carolyn Goodman has been the Mayor of Las Vegas from 2011 until today. The Goodmans currently run Las Vegas and work for the Italian and Jewish mafias. Meyer Lansky II is a current top Polish-Jewish Mafia boss in the United States and he is working with the Chicago Outfit and he manages territories in Las Vegas today. The Jewish mobsters have always been subordinate to La Cosa Nostra which authorized their formation of Murder Inc. through their Commission. Most of the top Jewish gangsters like Mayer Lansky and even Al Capone served Italian bosses like Big Jim Colosimo. Louis Capone was a boss of the Jewish Mafia known as Murder Inc. The Capone family are really a branch of the Florentine House of Capponi which is currently headed up by Count Neri Capponi today. Some of the Florentine noble families originated out of ancient Babylon. 

The Chicago Outfit is primarily owned by the Colonna family and Florentine noble families like the House of Medici and House of Capponi. John Roselli was a top gangster in the Chicago Mob. The Rosselli del Turco family are a Florentine nobility with Marchese Niccolo Rosselli del Turco as the current head. The Colonna family also own the Colombo crime family of New York City. Both the Colonna and Colombo names mean column. Hollywood is a joint operation infiltrated by the Chicago Outfit and Five Families. Albert Warner was a founder of Warner Bros. and married to Bessie Siegel whose first husband was likely a relative of Bugsy Siegel. Bugsy Siegel was a co-founder of Murder Inc. and was friends with Dorothy DiFrasso a member of Hollywood. Dorothy DiFrasso married Count Carlo Dentice di Frasso and she even introduced Bugsy Siegel with Benito Mussolini. The Frasso family are Sicilian nobility that have residences around Rome. The Five Families are competitors with the Chicago Outfit and also business associates at times. The Colombo crime family are the link between the two mafia factions. Jerry Reinsdorf is a billionaire and an owner of the Chicago Bulls and White Sox and he is a Jewish crime associate of the Chicago Outfit and Colombo crime family. Arnold Rothstein was a Jewish mobster from New York that had 8 players for the White Sox throw the World Series for the mafia's bets. The mafia still rigs professional sports for bets. Anthony Riccio is the second in command of the Chicago Police and an associate of the Chicago Outfit. Riccio handles Eddie Johnson the head of the Chicago PD who was appointed by the white collar Jewish mobster Rahm Emanuel who has a portrait of himself as the Godfather. 

Tony Rezko is a financier from Chicago that was convicted of wire fraud, money laundering, and corrupt solicitation which was a watered down charge for extortion. Rekzo also helped to finance Barack Obama's Senate campaign and sold him part of his property above the market value while under federal investigation. Alexi Giannoulias is a banker and politician from Chicago who has worked for Broadway Bank which financed Tony Rezko and also Chicago mobsters Michael Giorango and Demitri Stavropoulos with tens of millions. Barack Obama is friends with Alexi Giannoulias and they are both associates of the Chicago Outfit. Bline Bank is a bank based in Chicago created by the Fasseas family with Peter Fasseas and his wife Paula Fasseas. Several Mexican businessmen like the billionaire Antonio del Valle Ruiz and his son along with the group BXM Holdings has invested into Byline Bank which has been making a large amount of non performing loans. Antonio del Valle Ruiz is a high level overseer of Mexican drug cartels and he is worth over 3 billion. When banks make a lot of bad loans that don't get paid back it is usually for one of two reasons. The bank is using loans as a disguise for bribes and criminal pay offs which is what Byline Bank has been doing or the bank is using interest rates that are too high and that cannot be paid back. Roberto Herencia who was Jesuit educated at Georgetown has been Chairman of Byline Bancorp and Byline Bank and was President and CEO of BXM Holdings. Roberto Herencia was also nominated by Obama to serve on Overseas Private Investment Corporation’s Board of Directors. The Chicago Outfit have alliances with the Mexican drug cartels which the Five Families are in competition with. The Chicago Mafia's alliance with Mexican drug cartels is related to their owners relationship with cartel owners in Spain like the Aragon and FitzJames families. The Colonna family have family branches in Spain and ruled as Viceroys in Aragon, Valencia, and Catalonia. 

New York factions want a wall at the border to disrupt their networks. The Detroit Partnership work with both the Chicago and New York factions and the Balistrieri crime family are the Chicago Mob's reinforcement. Several top Mexican bankers went to the University of Chicago like Agustin Carstens the Governor of the Bank of Mexico and Francisco Gil Diaz the former Mexican Secretary of Finance. Robert Zimmer is the President of the University of Chicago and a very high level criminal associate of the Chicago Mafia. The Clinton and Obama families are in league with the Chicago Outfit and that is why Barack Obama was a professor at the University of Chicago. Rahm Emanuel is a Jewish mobster and associate of the Chicago Mob for the mob as the Mayor of Chicago and former Chief of Staff under Barack Obama. The Jesuit Georgetown educated John Podesta is from Chicago and the name Podesta is an Italian word for a high official or the chief magistrate of a city. John Podesta and his Jesuit Georgetown educated brother Tony Podesta founded Podesta Group a lobbyist racket. The Podestas and Hillary Clinton were caught using pizza as a metaphor for children and Hillary mentioned making a sacrifice to Moloch in these emails. The Podestas are involved with sex trafficking of children. Hillary Clinton was born in Chicago. Barack Obama was president under the ATF's Project Gunrunner which ended up supplying weapons to the Mexican Mafia and drug cartels which were used in various murders of Mexican citizens. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed by cartel associates and weapons found related to the crime traced back to the ATF's Operation Gunrunner also called Fast and Furious. Barack Obama promotes restricting the gun rights of Americans while supplying the Mexican drug cartels with guns that have murdered both Americans and Mexicans. 

The Chicago Outfit operate in Arizona which is located next to Las Vegas and they have business deals with the Los Zetas cartel which are owned by the FitzJames and Alvarez families which are dukes of Zaragoza, Spain and the founder of the Los Zetas was from Puebla de Zaragoza, Mexico. This is why the city of Tucson, Arizona is really named after Tuscany. Florence is the capital of Tuscany, Italy. There is a Florence, Arizona about 40 miles north of Tucson. The Florentine nobility manage the Chicago Outfit and the remnant of the Jewish Mafia for the Colonna family. The Chicago Outfit is involved in weapons, drugs, and human trafficking across the US-Mexican border. John DiFronzo who recently died was a top boss of the Chicago Outfit along with his brother Peter DiFronzo. Joseph Andriacchi acts as a consigliere. John DiFronzo owns car dealerships in Chicago. They use car dealerships for concealing stolen vehicles used for criminal trafficking and for obtaining dealer plates which makes it easier to move around stolen vehicles. The Italian Mafia are also involved in waste disposal and construction companies which are both used for disposing of bodies. The Carey family own the Hawthorne Race Course in Cicero right next to Chicago. Hawthorne Race Course was caught involved in rigging races with organized crime in the 1970's. Jimmy Inendino is a Chicago mafia boss in Cicero. Salvatore DeLaurentis is the current acting boss of the Chicago Outfit. The mafia use racetracks as headquarters and launder their criminal profits through fixed wins. The Chicago Outfit specializes in infiltrating the Democratic Party through blackmail, pedophilia, and human trafficking.

personalfinance,Question about lack of privacy with home buying,"I'm a pretty private person in some aspects. I have a lot of children and not a huge income in relation to all of them, but we live within our means and are not on any assistance. Everyone is fed and loved and happy. 

I'm looking into buying a house for the first time and I didn't realize how very not private every aspect of home ownership is. I don't tend to share my income, or how much I owe on my car, or my insurance costs, yet it's very easy to find someones home address and normally find pictures inside the house, as well as the amount you purchased it for.

This just seems bizarre to me. I get it, but it's weird knowing exactly how much house my boss can afford. 

Is there any etiquette I should know about regarding home purchase? Like, I'm sure my family and coworkers will know I'm buying a home and will look into all the details of it and offer all their ""advice"". Are there ways to avoid this besides just lying about buying a home? Or does that just come with the territory?",finance

**Assets**

-   20k in a defined contribution retirement plan, I get 10% of my base salary matched from work contributed monthly- it’s in a target retirement fund (I’m not allowed to contribute to this fund, only my employer can, but I can reallocate)  
    
-   7k in a 403b, I contribute 5% of my salary pre-tax  
    
-   HSA, I max it out at 2,150, my employer contributes the remainder to get me to 3,500 (currently 5k in there, 4k of it is invested. 30% in VIGAX, 70% in cash equivalent acct 0.2% APY)  
    
-   $500 in a 529 very late last year for the state tax credit  
    
-   72k in an inherited annuity held at Edward Jones  
    
-   inherited IRA at vanguard that's 10k in VSTAX and 2500 in an Invesco diversified dividend fund  
    
-   16k in a Roth IRA that’s in VTSAX (maxed out for 2018)  
    
-   15k in an emergency fund  
    

**Debt**

-   I owe about 4k on my car at a 2.74% interest rate. My interest rate is so good I just haven’t paid it off.  
    
-   About 8,800 in student loans left at 3.75% interest  
    
-   About 215k left on my mortgage at 4.25% fixed 30-year.  
    

Basically, I'm trying to figure out whether my investment and asset allocation seems okay (30 years old, 120k household income, very stable job, first baby on the way due in September). I'm also trying to figure out whether I have options for the fund in my brokerage account - I would prefer if those assets were in a tax-advantaged account as I don't expect to use it. I do auto transfers from my checking account to my Roth IRA every month, should I stop that and just max out my Roth every year from my brokerage account? Also, I was going to put the remaining 23k in my money market into VSTAX as well, any thoughts on that? Really appreciate any help!!!",finance

If  your only income was long term capital gains tax would you only be  paying federal taxes at the long term rates? For example if your only  income was $200k in long term capital gains, would you just pay 0% on  the first $38,600 and then 15% on the rest? I think there is a tax for  insurance that is relatively new that would maybe apply too.

This  seems pretty simplified, but I'm just trying to gauge if long term  capital gains can ever be taxed more than at the highest level. For  2018, this % being 20%. Seems like such a big difference from 37% for  top ordinary income rates.",finance

    So my fiancés parents really screwed her over. When she was applying to college instead of using the fafsa and going through the government; they took her to bank of America for a student loan. Her first year in an out of state private college  was around 25k. Luckily after that first year she went with government loans. 
     
    She went on to get her masters degree. But unfortunately she was deferring for about 7 years at about 10% interest!!! So now her loan balance is about 75k just for the first year of school.(almost as much as the rest of her school debt combined).
    
    Luckily for us (but even more  shitty by her parents) her brother is a jr. (exact same name and address at the time) so the parents used her brothers SS number as a co-signer. (IDENTITY THEFT! Her brother never reported it then and is now fully aware, in fact he is the current co-signer for the unsuccessful new loan) Her brother is active military so she was getting a maxed out rate of around 4.5%. But her brother isn’t active right now so the interest rate jumped up to 12.25%. So her ~$400 Payment went to ~$750

https://statesidelegal.org/servicemembers-interest-rate-cap here is why the interest jumped.
    
    Her current loans are car loan of ~9k, with ~2% interest car is worth what she owes. fed loan of ~110k(but she is working for a non profit  and has a payment plan and it will be forgiven in 10 years.) And $300 in credit cards which we pay off every month Her credit score is 712. I’d don’t have absolutely every detail but that’s most of it. 

Anyone know of anywhere her and her brother might get approved? That is the real reason for my post. But any help is appreciated.

I think that since I pay federal and state taxes on the money that I receive, I should be able to, even though I don't pay FICA taxes. I had a financial advisor tell me that because I don't pay FICA taxes, it's considered unearned income.

Right after the call and her giving them the info she called the 800 number that had called her and the auto message claimed to be from the her banks card services.

She looked at her statement and the transaction had been done for $8900. Now today almost two months later the bank called back after reviewing her case and said it was denied.  the reason saying she gave the fraudsters the card number which she did not.

personalfinance,Does it make sense in my situation to refinance to get rid of PMI?,"Hello, I am about 33 months into a conventional 30 year loan, rate is 4.0%. Original value was $574,000, current principal owed is $509,000. My monthly payment is $3500, and about $250 of that is PMI. My personal judgment on what my house would currently appraise for is probably around $610,000. We want to live here long term, 15 more years or until the last kid is out. My only other loan is a car loan which is a lower interest rate at 3.7%.

I have about $35k sitting around right now so I figured my first option would be to pay down $21k and then request my bank to remove the PMI after appraisal. Well, I guess I did not read the fine print on this one clearly enough because apparently due to my loan being between 2 to 5 years in age the LTV is required to be 75% and not 80%. 

So I noticed some of the options on bankrate would give me a P&amp;I payment of around $2500, so adding ~$690 for insurance and projected taxes would make that ~$3190. The ""fees"" listed would be about $2200 for that particular one. So in my mind it seems like paying the $21k principal + $2.2k in fees for a monthly payment that would be $310 less seems like a good idea. It would take about 7 months to make up the fees. 

My thought here is also to do this while comps are still up (hopefully) this season before there is a housing slump like some expect sooner rather than later. My concern with the various methods for dropping the PMI here is in some cases we need to assume that in 4-6 years my house would appraise for what I paid for it and forgive me for being pessimistic but I don't think that is guaranteed. One last question on this, do I even need to make a ""guesstimate"" principal payment like this before starting the refinancing/appraisal process, or is there an option after an appraisal comes back to pay more down to bring it to 80%? 

Can you help me understand if I have thought of everything and if this makes sense given my situation? Thank you.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Do you think that various governments will end up backing different crypto’s?,"I receive emails from various investment newsletters each trying to entice me into buying a subscription.  Today Manward Press sent me an e-mail recommending a particular crypto. Of course they wouldn’t say which one it was unless you bought their subscription, but based on the description of the crypto it was easy to figure out which one they were talking about.  

Anyway, they went on to say that Bitcoin is very dependent on China (74% is mined in China), as is ethereum (majority mined in China), and that President Trump doesn’t want China to control the crypto market.  To make sure the U.S. doesn’t fall completely behind China in the crypto sphere, the current administration will likely back XRP as Ripple Labs is an American  company (Manward press’s premise, not mine).

personalfinance,Need a Reality Check,"Hi and thanks in advance for your help!

I need some advice on if my plans are realistic or just plain stupid. I am currently enrolled in an online Post-Bacc which is being funded through federal loans. I will hit my lifetime limit a bit before the program is over (scary, I know...) so I will need to pay about $2k out of pocket or with private loans. I do have about $5k in savings to fall back on. I am currently interviewing for online part-time jobs that pay decently (\~$20/hr) that I'll probably keep during the duration of my degree. BUT I'd only be able to work 15 hours a week (making $1200/month). Also, I'm currently living with my parents abroad (they moved after they retired) which is really what complicates my situation. 

Normally, I'd be responsible and live with my parents while working part time, doing school part time time, and, as a result, be able to pay for the remainder of my school while saving on rent and affording my other costs (food, transportation, etc.). I'd basically be able to avoid taking our private loans altogether. However, because living with my parents means living abroad in a country where I don't speak the language, I was toying with the idea of moving back to the states, living with a friend, and taking out private loans to pay for the bulk of my cost of living. My main motivation for moving back to the states is to have a social life again, to be able to network with professionals in the field I am getting my degree in, and to be more readily available for internships/volunteering opportunities. But, of course, I'd be going even FURTHER in debt to do that which I know is risky. 

I've thought about getting a full time job to support myself in the states, however, my program is very rigorous and I'm not confident that I'd be able to juggle both. And I'm pretty sure that I would not be able to support myself on just a part-time job in the states, even if it is much more than minimum wage ($20/hr). So I'd have to take out private loans.

TL;DR Should I continue living with my parents in another country without the ability to network and socialize OR should I take out private loans to help me move back to the states and be more available for professional opportunities?

personalfinance,Create Tax Files for Yourself While Its Fresh In Your Mind; Save Yourself Stress and Panic Down The Line,"Just a friendly reminder as we head into tax season that now is a good time to also make sure all your tax documents are safely tucked away and organized. IRS audits can be for one year or multiple years. They may ask for specific information/supporting documentation or all of it. 

**IRS Audit Information:**

* [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/irs-audits](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/irs-audits)
* [https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/irs/audits-and-tax-notices/irs-audits/](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/irs/audits-and-tax-notices/irs-audits/)

The key to this is being prepared. You should keep record of your tax returns going back 7 years. In the event you are audited, you will have all supporting documentation ready and can avoid being panicked and stressed gathering all necessary information on time if you do it now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Each year I make a physical tax file. I store it in a locked fire proof safe. Each file has:**

1. Copy of that year’s tax return (both federal and state)
2. Originals or copies of W2s or 1099s or unemployment forms. If 1099, a 1040-ES which records estimated tax payments
3. Interest Income Statements 
4. Retirement Fund distribution statements (if applicable)
5. Stock Sale statements (if applicable)
6. Rental income statements (if applicable)
7. Certificate of Rent Paid (if applicable to your state)
8. Mortgage interest form (if applicable)
9. Student Loan interest form (if applicable)
10. Supporting documentation for itemization such as charity/donation receipts, moving expenses (for past years, 2018 TJCA removed this deduction for most people), medical expenses, educator expenses, home energy efficiency and more. More info on various credits and deductions can be found here: [https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions-for-individuals](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions-for-individuals)
11. Forms for sale or purchase of a home or business

I also make an electronic copy. I scan all documents in and store on an external hard drive. Some people may store in the cloud, but personally I am wary of it due to hacking/leaked data/etc. If anyone has good suggestions for online storage, please comment below!

The first time I created them was 2015 and I went back 7 years. I had to do some hunting down of information from prior companies and it was a nuisance. That’s why now I do it every year when I have all the documents on hand and I don’t have to go searching for them. It would also help me in event of an audit, because I won’t have to go tracking down moving receipts to support my 2016 moving expense deduction or find a W2 from 2013… it’s all there already. It’s also helped me when applying for a mortgage to have proof of income/tax returns easily accessible.",finance

I'm in the US on a temporary, 5 year visa. I just came into around $80k in cash after tax.

I read the prime directive, and followed the[ flow chart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png). I'm a bit stuck on what my options are.

I have a healthy emergency fund (not included in this)

My employer does _not_ currently offer a 401k/retirement match, and even if it did, I'm reluctant to use it because there's no guarantee I'll get permanent residency or even stay in the US past the 5 year visa.

I have no debts whatsoever, all student loans are paid in full (from the UK) and I pay off my credit cards each month.

I'd like to invest my money somewhere, but I'm not entirely sure where the best solution is.

The requirements are: 

* Have the money be accessible within 6-12 months in the event I have to leave the country (which I believe counts out using an IRA?)
* Ideally a better interest rate income than the 0.01% interest I get in my savings account

I have made a huge HUGE mistake. Three years ago, I moved across the country and started a different career path. Starting this career, I was making a ridiculously low amount of money, which has luckily increased over time. I've been with the company now for three years and am on salary. However, during this time I was not making enough to live and my car went belly up, causing me to take out payday loans.

I am current in making payments on the payday loans, but I feel like I'm not making a dent whatsoever in them. Currently, I owe about $8,000 overall in the form of very high interest loans and it's bleeding me dry every month. I am borrowing money to pay debt to incur larger amounts of debt, but I'm just not sure what to do. Now I am in the hole with family and while I'm making the payments, I'm not sure how long I can last doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

I walk away with about 2800 per month, 1000 goes to rent, 585 goes to my car payment/insurance as my credit was poor and my interest rate very high, 60 goes to utilities, and nearly $1000.00 in loan repayments alone. The rest is used for food. Honestly, I'm at my wits end. If I could get a personal loan of around 10k to consolidate all of the payday/peer loans, I would be in a much better place, but because of my credit this isn't possible. I'm just not sure what to do at the moment. my job usually requires me to put in around 60 hours a week and I'm freelancing on Upwork in my spare time.

I am a TurboTax convert and am very happy I made the switch.  I used to love TurboTax, but learning about their lobbying ways made the switch to FreeTaxUsa very easy.

My tax situation is not too involved, so FreeTaxUsa was very easy to use, but I could see it being rather straight forward even if I had a more intricate situation.

**Filing with standard deduction:**

Federal owed \~$400.

State refund \~$450. 

Itemized deductions totaled \~$21,000.

Standard deduction - $24,000

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, I thought, ""Standard deduction is higher, so obviously that is the way to go"", especially  since TurboTax has always recommended that I take the standard deduction, when my itemized deductions were less.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was finishing my filing with FreeTaxUsa though, it ""alerted"" me that I may benefit from itemizing my deductions instead of accepting the standard deduction.  

With one click, I filed with itemized deductions and this increased my refund by \~$300! Both federal owed and state refunded increased for the net gain of $300.  

&amp;#x200B;

**After filing with itemized deductions:**

Federal owed- \~$900

State refund - \~$1250

We've maintained a budget since finishing college and have been good at sticking to it and paying off debts (mostly student loans). Our goal is to pay off the house within 7 years so the loan length isn't as much of an incentive as it normally would be. We can afford the increase as I've been putting aside $1,000 biweekly into a separate mortgage account for the past 4 years so I can have at least 6 months of house payments saved in case something happens to one of us.

&gt;  
&gt;*Currently you are in a 30 year fixed FHA mortgage @3.899% with a payment of $1324 per month which includes taxes, insurance, as well as PMI.*  

&gt;  
&gt;*You have 24.5 years left on this current term!*

&gt;*We can remove the PMI and shorten the term to save you money over the life of the loan!*

&gt;*Here is a summary of what we can do!*  

&gt;
&gt;*15 year fixed conventional loan @4.375% with a payment of $1530 per month which still includes taxes and insurance!*  

&gt;
&gt;*No more PMI!  This will also save you 9.5 years off the current term!*  

&gt;
&gt;*That is 114 payments shorter!  114 X $1324 is $150,936 in payments saved over the life of the loan!*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Bring no money to close!*  

&gt;
&gt;*Skip 1 payment after closing!*

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for being willing to look this over and see if it's worthwhile. With no prepayment penalty I feel the refinance will bring the principal down faster which works in my best interest.

Also, the worldwide debt load is staggering as well when you add sovereign and corporate debt.  

&amp;#x200B;

What's going to happen in the next recession?  The likely scenario seems to involve a lot of defaults both sovereign and corporate.  The United States is considered the safest paper on the planet because the Fed can print money to pay off the debt.  Of course that comes with consequences like a weakening dollar and higher inflation theoretically.

* Student Loans (refinanced through Granite State):  $46,193.39 at 4.99% with a minimum of $557.66\* I have about 8.5 years left on the loan. Exactly 100 more payments. (Oh, Joy!)
   * My dad pays $200 of this month. So I pay **$358.57**  

* Credit Card: **$3979 at  24.24%** interest (This is whats fucking killing me. $80-100 of interest every month) 
   * I pay as much as I can... minimum is usually about $120... I pay around $2-400 depending on how much I can swing. It's usually only about $250  

* Best Buy Credit Card: Minimum of $27. Two different payment plans. Laptop: **$475 left with no interest till August 2019**  Product 2: **$1240 with no interest until October 2020** 
   * We pay about $130 here a month.   

* Midas Credit Card: **$582 with no interest until April 2019.** 
   * I had to take this card out last month. Fucking tires blew. Really didn't have viable choice, total punch in the gut. I've made one payment of $120. I planned to do $120mo for 5 months to pay it off.   

* Private Loan:  $2,908.86 with at 17.99% interest rate with a minimum of $120. 

We have a roommate who pays for 1/3 of the bills (rent, electric, ect) which ends up being about $440mo

&amp;#x200B;

Rent: $1105

Internet: $82

Electric: $80-120

Gym: $30

Various subscriptions: $25

Car insurance: $320 (we've shopped around, they kind of have us by the balls)

Between food, gas, ect we spend another $1200ish

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago I started putting $50 a check into a savings account. We need to move again (KILL ME) in the fall. Ideally to somewhere cheaper and without a roommate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $1000 from tax returns to put somewhere. I have an old savings account from when I was a kid with $351 in it that I intend to close and use. Can anyone offer some direction/advice.

&amp;#x200B;

My thought would be to put all of my taxes and such towards the credit card getting it down to \~$2500. But then again I don't know what the hell I'm doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I make about $60k/year. I'm working 55-70hours weekly. It's hard to estimate because some weeks I clear $1000 some weeks are closer to $600.",finance

personalfinance,Keep savings or get out of debt?,"My boyfriend and I have $26,000 in savings. We were going to buy a house and use that for a down payment but now after looking for two months and not finding anything we’re thinking we’ll just keep renting. I have $5,000 left on my car loan at 1.75% interest ($215/month payment) and $5,800 left of my student loans at 5.3% and 6% interest (less than $100/month payment). Do I keep the savings? Pay off both loans? Pay off one of the loans? This is the only debt we have, we pay off our credit card every month.

personalfinance,Debt Payoff vs Retirement Savings,"This has been answered a million times: pay off the debt first since the interest rate is usually higher... except my situation is somewhat unique.

&amp;#x200B;

I have $21,000 ish in credit card debt... at 0% interest. The 0% isn't a teaser rate, it's always going to be 0% with a $195 annual fee. I consolidated all of my debt to the one card to take advantage of it. And have been YNABing the last 6 months to get the budget under control.

I currently pay $800 a month on the debt. With the exception of the $5500 for a new A/C and water heater I didn't budget for, the balance has been steadily decreasing.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently put $900 a month into my 401k and $500 into my Roth every month. I get no employer matching.

&amp;#x200B;

I will get a guaranteed bonus of $25,000 after tax this September.

&amp;#x200B;

1. So what do I do? Pay off the debt using retirement savings even if it's only costing me a lower FICO score?  The opportunity cost of future retirement gains seems high to me.
2. Leave things the way they are and pay off what's left in September using the bonus?
3. Cut the $500 to the Roth, pay down more debt, and pay back the Roth using the bonus?
4. Cut debt payments to minimum and increase savings to build a bigger emergency fund? It's only like $2000- not enough to cover things big things like A/Cs. I'd still pay off credit card with bonus in Sept.
5. Some other option?

Thanks..",finance
CryptoCurrency,World wide Bitcoin implementation and adoption picks up momentum.,"Ex-Facebook product strategist Tomer Federman says Bitcoin and crypto have created “limitless” and “mind blowing” opportunities. In a new interview on the Hacker Noon Podcast, the CEO of crypto hedge fund Federman Capital says,

&amp;#x200B;

“When you take a step back, even with Bitcoin being, at the time of this recording, around $3500, generally, even last year, Bitcoin was worth $1000 at one point. Today, we’re still talking about an asset class that performs incredibly well over the past few years. I think this is just the beginning, as I said earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the projects I see right now and some of the opportunities are just limitless. The ability for people to transact with no intermediaries involved, and for the transactions to be recorded in an open way and settled almost immediately, the opportunities for building on top of the technology is just mind blowing. I’m super bullish on the space. I’m really excited about the opportunities. If people want to learn more, they definitely should look more into it. I remember people talking about the internet saying that it will never work, so I’m excited to see what’s next.”

&amp;#x200B;

One of the biggest banks in the Philippines is introducing cryptocurrency to its customers. UnionBank is installing crypto ATMs that allow customers to purchase and sell digital currencies for cash.

&amp;#x200B;

According to local news outlet Philstar, 

&amp;#x200B;

“In the bank’s continued quest to cater to the evolving needs and tastes of customers, including clients who use virtual currency, the ATM will provide these clients an alternative channel to convert their pesos to virtual currency and vice versa.”

&amp;#x200B;

The leading Philippines bank has over 300 branches, and is reportedly working with the central bank of the Philippines, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), to make sure the ATMs are fully compliant. Pictures that appear to show one of the bank’s Bitcoin ATMs, located at the main branch, are popping up on social media.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most popular mobile payment apps in the world will implement Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.

&amp;#x200B;

In a new interview, Square CEO Jack Dorsey says he’s working with the team at Lightning Labs to bring the Lightning Network (LN) to Square’s Cash App. LN is a layer-2 solution designed to speed up Bitcoin transactions and address major criticisms that the number one crypto is way too slow and impractical for mainstream adoption.

&amp;#x200B;

Appearing on Stephan Livera’s Bitcoin Podcast, Dorsey says making Bitcoin more transactional is a high priority, and that it’s only a matter of time before the company integrates the technology to make it faster and easier to use Bitcoin for purchases.

&amp;#x200B;

Says Dorsey,

&amp;#x200B;

“We’ve been exploring with Elizabeth and the Lightning team…

&amp;#x200B;

We would love to make it as fast and efficient and transactional as possible, and that includes looking at our seller base and our register. It’s not an ‘if’. It’s more of a ‘when’. And how do we make sure we’re getting the speed we need and the efficiency. A lot of what we’ve worked on the seller side is making transactions as fast as possible.”

&amp;#x200B;

Dorsey says the app has already gone a long way toward exposing Bitcoin to users around the globe, and giving them a way to spend BTC using the company’s Visa debit card.

&amp;#x200B;

“I think we have a pretty compelling experience that people who would not necessarily be able to get to Bitcoin in the past can now get to it with just one tap, and they can plug right into that 24-hour network and see it living and breathing. So we do intend to continue to expand it and do so in a way that feels simple, that feels approachable.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, what Cash comes down to is accessibility. How do we increase the amount of people that can participate in the economy more broadly. And Cash has gone a really far way in that. We see people who have never had a bank account start with Cash and use it to store their money, get the Cash Card, personalize it and spend it wherever they are. And certainly people can buy Bitcoin and sell the Bitcoin, and that goes into their Cash account which they can then spend using their Visa card.”

personalfinance,In-home end of life care assistance payments,"[MI, US]
I’m not sure whether PF is the most appropriate forum for my question. 

My father has a fast growing brain tumor with 1-2 months until he passes. When the tumor was discovered he had surgery and suffered a minor stroke that has left him unable to move his left side. Because of this he requires 24-hour care. 

My mother has left her part-time job as an LPN to care for my father around the clock. My sister has moved back into my parents home to assist in providing care. (She has lived 2k miles away for the last 10 years). 

My father is 68, has Medicaid and we are working on drawing on his SS benefits. 

Since both my mother and sister have left their jobs to care for my father in his last months, is there some sort of Federal or State financial assistance they could draw from? If they were unable to provide care he would be transferred to an in-patient hospice care facility paid for by Medicaid (or SS?).",finance

personalfinance,Playing with Capital Gains Fire,"I'm an early 40's freelance professional that has flipped a couple of real estate projects this last year with success, but accrued a potential capital gains tax liability that will hit this April to the tune of approximately $80,000. I saved that money, but invested it in domestic stocks in theses months before the Federal tax assessment is made. Currently, I am essentially at break-even with 30% $AMZN, 20% $GOOGL, 20% Foreign ETF, 10% $AMD, and the rest cash ... 

My retirement money is separate and fully funded, so my question is whether or not I cash this risky speculation out and start trading options to grow this pot agressivly short-term, hang tight as-is to wring out whatever modest gains I see in the next eight weeks, or pocket everything immediately to be sure I can pay Uncle Sam in full on April 15th.",finance

I normally file through TurboTax and the program said we owe nearly $3,500 in federal taxes.

I decided to try CreditKarma tax filing as well after receiving an email about it and their system is saying we only owe $2,100. I've added all the same W2s and we don't have any unusual tax situations.

I tried to Google for this and couldn't really find anything. I'm of course pleased that CreditKarma seems to be saving me some money but I am also suspicious that this is such a large discrepancy between the two programs.

personalfinance,Paying back student loans in the most effective way possible,"My goal is to pay back my student loans as effectively as possible.  I currently have $10k outstanding undergraduate loans at 6.800% APR.  I am also in law school now and currently have $15k in loans at 6.600% APR.  My law school loans will continue to increase up to $60k in the next three years.  

I have recently gotten a $10k bonus from work, and I am considering putting it all towards my student loans.  The main question is should I put this all towards the undergrad loans or the law school loans. 

When I first started thinking about this, I have always gone by the principal to pay off the higher interest rate loan first.  However the more I think about it, I am thinking that because my law school loans will be so high in the next few years, putting 10k towards the balance now will help me in the long run by decreasing the interest that accrues over the next few years. 

Is there any concrete way to see the effects of putting 10k towards one or the other?   Any other advice is always welcome as well.",finance
personalfinance,Money doesn’t make a difference?,"I am a mid 20 something in NYC. 

Houses are about 225 for a small condo or 750 for a single family home. If I were to buy, I would probably put down 10 percent. I have a fixed rate student loan of 16k, min payment is 327 and it is a 5 year term, 3.3 percent interest rate. I make 90k, and this will increase to about 117 in 6 months. However, it seems like I can’t get ahead. I have to walk to work because they charge for parking, and I have six roommates. 


I hi have 10k cash and 8k in retirement, 3 k in has and 13k in taxable stocks, 6k in Roth IRA. But even being in a situation where in theory I am doing well, the fact that I pay 1200 in rent is stressing me a lot, and the noise of my roomies is causing me to lose sleep. Even if I make a grand or two trading stocks ( which I have), that money wouldn’t really be life changing. I am saving up for a downpayment of 22-30k for a condo, and have 5k incoming for a tax refund, but it is still very overwhelming that even an extra 5k after tax really wouldn’t change my life that much. 

None of this is meant to be a “I am making 200k and have no debt am I doing this right” flex, but why doesn’t it feel like I am getting ahead? I am trying to move to a cheaper place.",finance

personalfinance,What to do with a broken car and an upside-down loan?,"The complications in finding a solution to this problem are driving me crazy. Basically, I have a balance of about $7000 left on a car loan that was initially $9000. The car now needs to have a new engine in order to be functional (about $6000 parts and service). Ignoring (please) the series of bad decisions that led me (my wife) into this scenario, the problem we are now faced with seems like it should be simple (it isn't). Basically we just want the following:

1) Get rid of the car as soon as possible. 

2) Pay off the loan in the appropriate timeframe. We don't want to abandon our financial obligations or harm our credit. We are happy to keep paying off the loan as we have been. 

Caveats: we can't afford to repair it or to pay off the balance on the loan. We also don't have any family or friends that could loan us the money. Its market value in this state is too low to arrange a private sale combined with a loan pay-off for title.

The reason we want to get rid of the car now rather than hold on to it is simple. We are renters, and we will likely be moving soon. We have nowhere to put it and nothing to do with it. I looked into voluntary surrendering it (and continuing to pay the loan), but apparently that isn't really any better for your credit than straight up repossession. There is also the possibility of getting a different loan to pay off the car with so that I can get the title, but it would have to be an unsecured loan so the interest rate would likely be much higher.

Neither me nor my wife are intellectual titans when it comes to finances, obviously. I'm just trying to figure out what my options are in case there is some possibility I am unaware of- it seems like the problem is unique enough that it is difficult to find useful information about. If it matters, we live in Massachusetts. Does anyone have any advice?",finance
personalfinance,Question about Taxes,"The short:   
The company my wife and I work for didn't withhold enough to cover us this tax season. There's a $153 penalty for not withholding enough money. Since HR at our job is supposed to withhold taxes, is it fair that I ask to be reimbursed for the $153.  


The long: My wife (25) and I (26) work as therapists at a privately owned clinic. We don't have children. Together, we made around 160k last year. We are 2-3 years out of grad school and haven't been doing our own taxes much - even then, her mom usually does them for us. This year, her mom told us that we owed \~$6,000. I didn't like that, so we took our information to another place just to check. The new place said basically the same thing: that we owed $6500 in Federal taxes but would get back $500 from State taxes. The new place told us that we were in the 22% bracket with an effective tax rate of 15.7%. They also informed us that our job had withheld at a rate of only 9.3% before suggesting that this was a main factor in why we owed so much.   


I've got no problem in paying my fair share, but I don't believe that I should be held liable for the $153 penalty. I was ruminating on the idea of asking my job to reimburse this fee for me, but I wanted to ask my friend Reddit first.

Hi team,
One of the guidelines on /r/stocks is not to hesitate to tell us about a ticker we should know about!  So here it is.

Following up on the previous post submitted 6 months ago - 

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/95mnqm/mission_ready_solutions_mrs_a_monster_in_the/

After a 6 month halt and reverse takeover, MRS has completed the acquisition of Unifire Inc, one of the 6 companies who are able to bid on the for the Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) Special Operational Equipment (“SOE”) Tailored Logistics Services (“TLS”) contract renewals which total up to $33 billion in 10 years. MRS has submitted it's tender to the Department of Homeland Defense and apparently, they'll know in March 2019 how much of this pot they would receive. Historically, the majority of the contracts have gone to Atlantic Diving Supply but in the recent years, ADS has fallen out of favour with the DOD due to their fraud allegations.

MRS has a strong board of directors which is one of the reasons why they might/could get a fair chunk of the contracts on a given year. One of their board members is Bill Bratton, America's Chief of Police and Spider Marks, a decorated military general.

I want to be a little more independent, hopefully save a few dollars, and learn a little bit in the process. 

I looked at TaxAct, they said it would be free for a federal return if it was W2 income and education expenses + like $20 for state return (NJ). I went through the program and it said I would have to upgrade to the $40 program because I had education expenses in 2018. This seemed like a bait and switch almost.

I'm a single guy who pays enough mortgage interest and property taxes to itemize my return. 

I'd like to come as close as possible to having no tax return next year and increasing my take-home throughout the year. I get paid twice a month, so ideally I'd get $195 extra per pay period ($4700/24). Looking at at a take home pay calculator (the best one I've found is paycheck city), it looks like I need to claim 6 Federal Allowances on my W-4 in order to net an extra $195 per pay check.

That seems pretty high.  Is there any way to check it that is correct? The IRS withholding calculator is hard to understand and not user friendly.",finance

I want to be fair to my employer, but I really need the income and insurance.  

Can I offer to:
A) work for “free” for 20hrs a month to cover my insurance (hence no payroll liability for those 20 hrs) then Anything after that I get a paycheck as a w2 employee.

B) move to a 1099 employee, but still stay on his insurance. That way I get insurance and he doesn’t have to pay the payroll liab for me.

Is there another method of calculating interest  that I am unaware of? Please help! I am about to sign this loan, and I am slightly confused at how they arrived at this rate.

personalfinance,"I lost my job and have received some paperwork about COBRA, term life insurance, and 401k payout. I have a few questions if you have time.","The term life insurance policy says that if I continue my coverage of $50,000 I will be charged about $12 per month plus $3.00 per quarter for administration. I have a SO but we don't live together and no kids. 30 (M). Do I really need the term life insurance?

The 401k paperwork says that I have the option to leave the money in the account and I would be charged a maintenance fee of $11.25 per year. They say I can request a payout at anytime and continue to direct investments into the account. This is what I am leaning towards since I don't have a Roth IRA set up currently and my income was more than what was allowed for an IRA but I would like to hear other opinions. 

The other payout options were getting a check for the full amount and being charged 20% for Federal taxes plus an additional 10% early distribution income tax. Doing a rollover into a Roth IRA and being charged 10% for taxes. There is also an option to receive a payout in company stock and the unrealized stock appreciation will not be taxed as capital gains until I sell the stock. Are any of these options better than just leaving it where it is until I get a new 401k and is there a situation where taking the payout would be advisable?

Lastly, the option to continue my health insurance through COBRA will be a monthly premium of $18.39 for dental and $257.16 for my HSA plan of which I have a $5,000 deductible. I am currently fit and healthy but the idea of risking it without health insurance concerns me because tommorow is not promised and anything can happen. Is it worth it for $275.55 per month to continue coverage through COBRA or should I try the Marketplace? 

I currently have an Emergency Fund that should last well past the 6 month mark and longer if I get more conservative. I am currently receiving unemployment benefits and actively looking for work but I have been unemployed for nearly a month.

I am 21 years old and had made the decision to not go to college and instead became a welder. Well now that was two years ago.

I am currently living with my fiance at my parents house. They don't charge us rent which is awesome but we are starting to look at moving out.

We have entertained the idea of buying a standard house however every time I look at an amortization schedule of a mortgage. Even a 15 year one it freaks me out how much interest I will be paying and makes me feel like I'll never be able to retire. Much less early retire. Along with having to constantly be up keep a house that in my price range (150-200k) would be atleast 30 years old. 

To buy 10 acres in NC and build a metal building and frame out a living quarters we would be looking at around 150k also. Which makes me wonder why not do what I want and what would make me happy. Rather than ""buy someone else's problem""?

worldpolitics,Corporate Monopolization,"One aspect of Zionism is corporate monopolization over wealth and industries. The Walton and Wallenberg families are the epitome of corporate communists and Zionists. The Walton family are worth about 170 billion. They own Arvest Bank which they use for financing criminal agendas and money laundering. The Waltons were exposed and investigated for making cash bribes in Mexico to dominate over the market. They also have major leverage over the Stock Market. The Swedish Wallenbergs are industrialists controlling many major corporations with Jacob Wallenberg as a board of director of NASDAQ. They use stock market fraud and covert insider trading for financing corruption and making bribes. Walmart is technically an illegal monopoly based on the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. They are violating the Antitrust Act of 1890 in numerous ways as existing as monopolies and manipulating markets. They are criminally conspiring to monopolize industry with the intent of negatively effecting privately owned businesses that are not corporations. Their motive is destroying small businesses which destroys self reliance. The Waltons need to be at minimal imprisoned and their wealth needs to be seized. They are a white collar mafia that is oppressing the rest of society. Corporations are considered a person with rights under corporate law. Corporations are not people and therefore are fraudulent concepts. The owners of corporations like the Waltons are able to evade responsibility for crimes committed by their corporation because the corporation is the person and responsible itself under this fraudulent racket. The Wallenberg family are a Swedish family controlling hundreds of billions worth of corporations and use their control of wealth and assets to manipulate the European markets. All through out history the Christian royal families have used Jewish Court Factors to handle their finances and collect taxes and this keeps the attention off them. The Court Factors are a middle wall of defense for the royalty which are higher level in the control system. The monarchs and princes authorize court factors from their royal courtrooms to carry out their financial interests. The Waldenberg and Waldburg families are a Christian German nobility subservient to the Hohenzollern, Saxe, and Wurttemberg families and formerly under the House of Habsburg who still have a portion of covert authority over the Germany royalty today. 

The Wall bloodlines are Urartian-Sarmation chameleons that are posing as Suevians. Swabians, and Swedes. The Waldenberg family are of Swabia and the Waldburg family are from Baden-Wurttemberg. The names Swabia and Sweden derive from the original Suavi settlers and their name means ""ones own"" and crereign"". These current rulers of Sweden and Swabia are not real Suavian ancestors. The word wall in Wall Street derives from the Germanic word Walhaz which means foreigner. They were and are foreign invaders that infiltrate and undermine other cultures which they take advantage of. The Bernadotte name is connected with Berne, Switzerland and the family shares ancestry with the German-Swiss Diesbach and Berenberg families. The Bernadottes that rule Sweden immigrated to Sweden a few hundred years ago. In Sweden there is the extremely wealthy Wallenberg family which share a similar ancestry with the House of Waldenberg. The Wallenbergs manage many corporations as boards of directors. Together it is believed they manage companies worth hundreds of billions. They are also members of the Bilderberg Group. The House of Bernadotte have influence over the European Round Table of Industrialists which has economic leverage over the European Union. Many members of the ERT are Swedish knights and French knights. The Bernadottes and Bonapartes of France have an alliance and fought together. The Bonapartes appointed the Bernadottes to the Swedish throne. The Wallenberg family are Christian-Jewish Court Factors serving the Swedish House of Bernadotte which has recent Germanic ancestry through marriages with German nobility that were directly involved with Nazis. The Wallenberg family financed the Nazis through their Stockholms Enskilda Bank and also helped some criminal Jews leave Germany. The Holy Roman and Scandinavian royal families have large amounts of shares in corporations, authority over billionaires, CEOs, and extensive hidden wealth. They use this wealth to finance a wall of protection. Mark Wahlberg is a Knight of Malta and works for the Jesuit Georgetown educated Marcus Wallenberg. Mark Wahlberg is a psychopath that runs a military unit of Scientologist and Knights of Malta which use electronic weapons. 

The Walton family own Walmart which uses the six pointed star for its logo. The six pointed star is a symbol for Zionism. The hexagon is the most efficient geometric shape for processing thermal energy. This is why many snakes have hexagonal scales used for absorbing solar rays. Snowflakes often take the shape of hexagonal stars from the heat extraction. The Chigi-Albani della Rovere family used six hexagrams on their papal coat of arms and they are Roman nobles that are married with German nobles and were both nobles and bankers. Prince Mario Chigi and his son Prince Flavio Chigi are managers of the Waltons. The Walton's collective net worth is estimated around 170 billion and they are also Court Factors serving the House of Windsor and other German nobility. Corporate Zionism is about dominating industries and wealth with the intention of making a large portion of society impoverished. Walmart is a destructive monopoly that is taking away from small businesses. Small businesses cannot fairly compete with corporations which are also protected by laws and regulations issued by the federal government and put forth by corporate lobbyists. They use expensive lawyers who make hidden loopholes in these laws and regulations which only the privileged are aware of. This is why lawyers use their own terminologies. These billionaires also use their large wealth as a pool of money for making illegal transactions. Someone with tens of billions can move around a hundred million and it goes unnoticed and then the money gets refilled by the foreign powers they serve. They use their wealth to finance secret societies and organized crime which are oppressing the rest of society as a defense for the royal families. The Waltons sold many of their Walmarts to the government which are being used to imprison and traffic immigrant children. The Wallenberg and Walton families use their wealth to fund a Wall of defense. These monopolies should be shut down immediately and these families need to be criminally investigated. The Howard de Walden family in the UK are from this bloodline and believed to be worth about 4 billion with the Hollywood movie producer Peter John Joseph Czernin and his mother Mary Czernin the 10th Baroness Howard de Walden. Members of these criminal billionaire families include Jacob Wallenberg, Marcus Wallenberg, Peter Wallenberg Jr, and Jim Walton, Samuel Robson Walton, Alice Walton, Steuart Walton, Lukas Walton, James Walton, Carrie Walton-Penner, and others. The Walton family work under various tyrannical princes including Duke Carl of Wurttemberg, Margrave Maximilian of Baden, Prince Mario Chigi-Albani della Rovere and the very wicked Prince Erich Waldburg of Zeil and Trauchburg. Various wealthy European royals and nobles like the Wurttemberg, Baden, Hohenzollern, Chigis, Stuarts, Waldburg-Zeil, Anhalt, and others funnel their wealth through the Waltons and Wallenbergs accounts used for financing corruption, human trafficking, and organized crime creating a wall of defense for evil.

personalfinance,Financial planning advice for a resident physician,"Hi there, 

27yo woman, graduated from one of the most expensive medical schools almost 2 years ago and currently have about $370,000 in loans. I recently had a mishap with fedloan (student loan services) and am looking to get more organized with my finances since I’ve never been very savvy with that. 

Some background information: I have a chase freedom credit card which I usually use so that I can always dispute a charge, I have a checking account through Bank of America which I might cancel because I recently had a very unpleasant customer service experience with them, and I have an automatic savings acct in Bank of America. 

All of my loans from undergrad (state school which I took out minimum loans for) and medical school are through fed loan and I’m on income based repayment. I was paying about $200/month automatically starting last December and since I recently recertified, I will be paying about $20/month. I have signed up for public service loan forgiveness but I don’t have very high hopes for that. 

I’m currently in psychiatry residency and have about 2 Years left. My salary currently is about $3200/month with taxes and I live in one of the most expensive cities. Once I graduate I will be making attending psychiatrist salary which should be at least $200K/year. 

What are the open questions I should ask/pursue?

Any help with organizing my finances or teaching me what I should be doing/asking would be greatly appreciated! :) 

Edit: 

I’m honestly not great at keeping track of the breakdown of my salary (would appreciate an easy tool for that) but here is a rough estimate: 
50% of my salary goes to paying rent
Another 25% goes to to various spending like groceries, dinners, random things, $100 goes to my savings acct automatically every month and the rest stays in my checking acct.

personalfinance,Some things I learned while refinancing my student loans,"Many of us have student loans of some sort, so I  wanted to share some things I learned from refinancing my student loans that no one seems to talk about. I hope to save you some frustration and money!  At worst, at least you'll have something to benchmark.

Some background - I powered through 3 business degrees and got a good paying job, but I now my \~10 loans are near repayment.

Credit score ranging from 710-765.  I have 140k all with federal set rates  ranging from 3.4-6.8%. Refinancing was definitely a good idea. I ultimately ended up refinancing most of my loans through a combination of SOFI and ELFI (through credible)... see below the underwriter is still MOHELA for both.

1. There's  a lot of options in appearance, but in practice there's only a few loan servicers. MOHELA and Navient (Sallie Mae) are big ones. Most of the  websites like SOFI, Credible, ELFI, are just intermediaries, they are *NOT* the underwriter. They do not make the decisions and your loans are still going to be handled by one of the big companies!
2. Companies  like SOFI and ELFI are going to have very different terms. Their customer service is mostly BS. For example, SOFI calls themselves a  conservative lender but then has very aggressive payoff schemes where you have to payoff your loans in 5 or 7 years to get the best rates.
3. The customer service of these intermediaries is worthless, despite how friendly they may be.
4. At the end of the day your income, your credit score, and your overall ability to repay affects your rates... these companies will not share their formulas with you.  *It is in YOUR best interest to spend time playing with the numbers.*   After I verified income, my rate went down and I was thrilled, so I  asked for a larger loan (specified another loan), and despite multiple reps assuring me that my rate would not change. Guess what?! It did and  it probably will for you. SOFI then tried to get push my application  through and attested they had no recollection of a lower rate.  Call them back/modify your application. I removed the other loan and my rate went back down.  Even a 0.25% at 15k is about $40/year, and this stuff can really compound.
5. Your credit score will take some big hits for the process. Two companies, two hard hits, and I lost about 40 points. This is the scummy part of how credit works.
6. You might want to consider multiple companies. Aggressive and conservative.  I did 25k at a 4.7% rate for 5 years and about 60k at 5.4% for 15 years. This gave me a good mix. Overall, I will save \~$800 in interest my first year alone.
7. For academics, these servicers are clueless. When they verify your income, they use monthly... meaning that if you're paid over 9 months... *cha-ching* for you. They will multiply one month by 12.

I  am not recommending any particular company and only outlining my experience with information I wish I knew beforehand.  This was an incredibly frustrating process but worth it with the savings in the end.  Hopefully, my info/story will help you.",finance

datascience,"How to deal with transphobic, condescending coworkers?","A little bit about myself, I’m a recent Econ grad school graduate and a FtM trans man. I accepted a position about a month ago at a notable data science, analytics, and management company that is your typical run of the mill “big data” tech startup you hear so much about. 

I’m the only person in my cohort of coworkers who ISN’T a computer science major. My coworkers are all graduates from big engineering schools, many of them are recent undergrad graduates as well. My expertise is in economics, but I could probably run circles around their supposed statistical skills. 

And this was demonstrated recently at a meeting on a large dataset we were tasked with analyzing. I can’t give too much information, as we sign NDAs, but issues arose over what model we would apply. I worked with a similar dataset in my grad school days, and it seemed to me that a simple logistical regression model would suffice to explain the trends. 

Before I could give my reasoning for this, my CS coworkers interrupt me and say “Well, that’s too *simple* of an explanation, I say we try this deep machine learning neural algorithm to test out first.” I exaggerate of course, it was a convoluted model that would be superfluous for such a large dataset.  I voiced my concerns and defended my model, but was scoffed and laughed at by my coworkers. They were joking about my Econ background, “how did you even get to work at this tech company.” Their banter was, expected, as I’ve noticed that’s how their personality is. But it still stung. 

Later on, a close friend of mine overheard the boys talking about my being transgendered and absolutely mocked me behind my back.

personalfinance,How do I calculate the opportunity cost of paying off my mortgage vs investing?,"Hey PF. I'm a high earner, and I want to know effectively how much worse off I'd be by aggressively paying off my mortgage versus investing in the market. I make enough to cover my expenses and tax-advantaged savings, so this is all ""extra"" money that I want to focus on.

I know the question is a bit silly since we can't predict the market, but let's assume reasonable returns. I think I usually see the ""10% before inflation"" for VTSAX, but we can be more conservative, let's say 5% post-inflation?

I don't quite know how to calculate this, but here's where I'm at:

- $376k left on mortage at 4.0%, 348 months (29 years).
- Assume I pay this amount off in 4 years. No prepayment penalty.

I'm playing with my mortgage servicer's amortization calculator. 

- Under normal payments, I would spend $58k in interest over that period. 
- Working under the constraints of the calculator, let's say I make additional $40k payments twice a year; that allows me to pay it off in December 2022, paying $27.6k in interest, saving me $30.4k. In total, I'd spend $404k.

I don't know how to determine the actual effective interest rate savings there since it's over time, but even if we said (savings / principal / years) = ($30k / $376k / 4) ~= 2.0%, it's paltry.

With some fudging, assuming I were to sell my house immediately after paying it off, the savings are just that $30k. If I stay longer, the interest savings grow, but so would the investments, so it's a curve that likely widens in favor of investing.

I suspect I'm thinking about this incorrectly, but hopefully you can enlighten me. Thanks in advance.",finance

I also am putting $50/week into a Roth IRA through wealthfront.

financialindependence,Simplified monthly saving rate estimates for FIRE,"So I realized that not everyone that wants to FIRE is necessarily savvy with Excel or with math in general. I took a quick few numbers to do a simplified calculation of how many years of saving it would take to hit the standard goal of saving up 25x annual spending. The 25x is a rule of thumb found in the FAQs of this forum. This is really just for estimation since real savings and returns aren't going to be identical year after year.

I assumed a net return on investments (after inflation) of 5%. This uses a percentage of your retirement income goal as the savings input, so 30% would mean that every year, you plan to save \~30% of the amount you plan to spend annually in retirement. Your income isn't a factor and the dollar value doesn't matter either - just the ratio of your savings compared to what you want to draw. This produces the number of years you'd need to save to get 25x of your annual retirement spending in your account. 

Using an input of 5% net return and a target account value equal to 25x your annual retirement spending needs, you get:

Annually invest 10% of your retirement income needs - 53.4 years to retire

Annually invest 20% of your retirement income needs - 40.6 years to retire

Annually invest 30% of your retirement income needs - 33.7 years to retire

Annually invest 40% of your retirement income needs - 29.1 years to retire

Annually invest 50% of your retirement income needs - 25.7 years to retire

Annually invest 60% of your retirement income needs - 23.1 years to retire

Annually invest 80% of your retirement income needs - 19.3 years to retire

Annually invest 100% of your retirement income needs - 16.6 years to retire

Annually invest 200% of your retirement income needs - 10.0 years to retire

Edit: As an example, if you’ll need to spend $50k per year after you retire and you can save about $30k per year while working, every year you are saving $30k/$50k = 60% of your annual retirement draw needs. Looking at the table, at this pace you’re on track to retire in about 23 years. 

Down in the comments I show another quick calculation which is how much income an existing investment is expected to yield at retirement by using the same assumed interest rate and 4% draw rate. The results are:

Immediate draw - $40/yr per $1k invested

5 years maturation —&gt; $51/yr per $1k

10 years maturation —&gt; $65/yr per $1k

15 years maturation —&gt; $83/yr per $1k

20 years maturation —&gt; $106/yr per $1k

25 years maturation —&gt; $135/yr per $1k

30 years maturation —&gt; $176/yr per $1k

/Edit

Details: I used Excel's Future Value formula ""FV"" to do this. An example formula in Excel is =FV(5%,33.7,-30%)\*1. \[The ""\*1"" at the end just keeps Excel from misformatting your result.\] You can paste that directly into a cell in Excel and it will give a result of about 25. This example formula uses an annual savings rate of 5%, a term of 33.7 years, and an annual saving rate of 30% of your anticipated spending. The formula result (\~25) is the multiple of your retirement spending goal that you've saved. By tweaking the input parameters or targeting a different output you can see a range of savings rates, terms, and interest rates that will get you to your goal. I hope this is helpful to someone.",finance

personalfinance,Best way to finance a $15k medical procedure?,"I'm looking to finance an elective medical procedure that will cost around $15k. I had originally planned on taking out a secured loan using my paid-off car as collateral (car is worth over $18.5k according to bank I applied to), but my loan application was rejected, with the rejection reason cited as ""Temporary and/or irregular source of income.""


The thing is, the rep with the bank I applied for the loan through (USAA), which I also have auto insurance and checking accounts with, said that I could put down my student loan refunds -- I'm in graduate school -- as a source of income in addition to the $1200 gross pre-tax income I earn bi-weekly. I also will be living at home for the next few years, have almost no expenses, and have no dependents. I told the bank rep these things as well. 


So having said that, I told them that I received around $18.6k/yr in two student loan disbursements (one at the beginning of the fall semester, one at the beginning of the spring semester). She said that the underwriting dep't. chose to reject my application because even though student loan refunds ""count"" as a source of income, the fact that they're disbursed twice yearly caused them to consider them to be a ""temporary/irregular source of income.""


I'm really surprised that my application was rejected, especially since I was offering to put my car (which is totally paid-off) down as collateral. My credit score was also a 738 at the time, according to Experian; it was lowered to 733 after submitting my loan application.


So now my question is, how can I go about paying off the procedure? I actually have a separate checking account with almost enough money in it to pay off the entire surgery, but I would prefer to finance the surgery and have more liquid cash available to spend, even if it means paying some interest. Since I will be getting two more loan disbursements over the next academic year anyways, I was planning on paying off the surgery in less than 2 years, which would've kept the amount of interest paid down to a minimum. It would be nice if my surgeon would offer to allow me finance the surgery through his office, but that's not happening (I asked), and in-house financing seems to be pretty unheard of anyways. 


I'm really disappointed because my interest rate was going to be &lt;5.5% and monthly loan payments were only going to be around $260/month, which would've been easily affordable for me. I really don't want to wait to put off the surgery because the procedure I'm getting is fairly specialized, and the surgeon I'm going (who is really well-known for doing the surgery well) will probably be retiring soon.


Having said all this (probably should've done a TL;DR), what are my next best steps for financing the procedure? Should I just apply for a few credit cards at this point, or should I re-apply to the same bank but list my student loan refund as monthly income instead of 2x/year income? I could apply for a loan with a different lender, but I've noticed that none of them seem to offer the option of applying for a secured loan, which means I'd be looking at interest rates of at least 17-18% (based on pre-qualification offers I've looked at). I just hate to risk knocking my credit score lower with another hard pull from USAA if I reapply with them, only to end up getting my app rejected again.


Thanks in advance",finance

I put in my information, and they asked me some personal questions that were clearly things from my past, so they had the right person. I answered them, and they told me they couldn't locate me. Even though they just asked questions that were directly things from my past.

Only one of the questions was suspect. I bought a new(used) car about 4 years ago. I paid cash for the car, but when I pulled my money out of the bank they asked if I wanted to take out an auto loan. I asked what interest rates they could offer, got an answer(that I don't remember), and turned it down in favor of paying cash for the car. 

The Experian question asked what the monthly payment was on the car loan I took out 4 years ago. I didn't take the loan, so I said ""Not Applicable"" to the question. It then promptly said it didn't know who the fuck I was and to go away.

Does anyone know what could be going on here? I'm still using the bank that would have pulled my credit and they've never mentioned me owing them money for the last 4 years, so I know I didn't take out that loan. I can't even log in to check if there was anything fraudulent going on.

Edit: Another thing that could be throwing a wrench into things, I'm currently living with my parents and not paying rent. It's the address on my driver's license, but I have no rental history at this address.",finance
personalfinance,college didn't send a 1098-t,"&gt;  Our records show that you were not eligible for a 1098-T in 2018.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Some reasons a student may not be receiving a 1098-T include, but are not limited to:
&gt; 
&gt; - Tuition payments were only for non-credit courses, even if the student is otherwise enrolled in a degree program.
&gt; 
&gt; - Scholarship and or financial aid exceeded qualified tuition and related expenses.
&gt; 
&gt;- Qualified tuition and related expenses are covered by a formal billing arrangement between the college and the student’s employer or a government entity, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Department of Defense.
&gt; 
&gt;- If you paid for your enrollment fees but dropped all your classes and received a refund during that calendar year, then you would not receive a Form 1098-T.

was in an email quoted by my college. The problem is, none of those qualify for me. The only thing I can think of is that I took out a federal direct loan that exceeded my tuition costs. However, to the best of my research it looks like that shouldn't count and I should still be able to get a 1098-t or reimbursed for my tuition. Can someone please explain what I should do, as I am doing my own taxes on turbotax this year. Also, if it matters, I did not receive my 2018 student loan till January of 2019.",finance

personalfinance,Trying to find a balance between paying off my student loans and contributing to my 401k.,"My Situation: 
I recently graduated from college in mid December and started my career in mid January. My gross annual income is $72k (approximately $55k net) and the company I work for matches 100% on my first 3% contributed to my 401k and 50% on the next 3% contributed (for a total of 100% matching of 4.5% when I contribute 6% or more). 
I currently have approximately $45k in student loan debt which I’m still in the grace period for until mid July. Half of my student loans are federal loans which will incur interest at about 5%, while the other half are from a private party and do not incur any interest, but still need to be paid back in full. 
For total living expenses (including rent, utilities, tv/streaming services, phone, estimated car payment (if I need to buy a different car), car insurance, gas, employer health insurance payment, food, and some fun money), I’m looking at approximately $1675/month.

My question:
I’m trying to figure out how to allocate my remaining net income between student loan payments, 401k contribution, and emergency fund. From reading previous posts in this sub, it seems like paying off my student loans as fast as possible is a good idea, but would it really be worth not taking full advantage of my company’s 401k contribution while I’m doing that? 
I’m very new to all of this having only just begun my career, so any advice you guys can give me will be much appreciated, thanks!",finance

ethereum,ProgPoW: Does the origin of open-source code matter?,"\*\*\*\* Update Feb 14, 11:30 GMT: Maybe the answer is - the origin of open-source code does not matter, but the energy flow matters. How do we go from open-source to open-energy, and slightly separate but related - can we define computer rights? People who accept closed-energy code have to trust the author, and we see in this post how vicious some authors may dodge questions, for whatever reason. People who insist on open-energy code don't need to trust the author, but need to define what is high-quality open-energy code. \*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\* Update Feb 14, 7:50 GMT: Our account remains banned, thanks everyone for the great discussion. \*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\* Update Feb 13, 20:05 GMT: Well due to account ban we cannot reply anymore. Or remove spam. Our Wikipedia page also got vandalized (""company does not exist""). Free speech in the western hemisphere. Some people seem to care a lot about the origin of open-source code. We are powered by happiness. \*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\* Update Feb 13, 19:15 GMT: Someone had this post removed from the subreddit and the posting account banned. Apologies to commenters that we cannot reply anymore. Please help Ethereum, do your own research. \*\*\*\*

*\[Disclaimer: We work on Ethash ASICs and would benefit from ETH remaining with Ethash longer\]*  
*Continuing a conversation with Daft-Wullie from gitter, about whether the origin of the ProgPoW sources matters or not:*

&amp;#x200B;

Anonymous and pseudo-nymous contributions in open-source used to be exceedingly rare, and were never discussed to any serious degree. Open-source principles relied on responsibility, pride, transparency. Linux kernel contributions without disclosure of employment status would have been mostly unthinkable.

That was until **Satoshi had the mercurial idea of releasing code into the world that was not tracable back to anyone**, from day one. Satoshi gifted us with this, but he also caused new problems. What if Satoshi had a secret deal with the US Federal Reserve who is today in possession of his 1 million BTC?

[https://www.master-of-finance.org/10-most-outrageous-stock-market-scammers/](https://www.master-of-finance.org/10-most-outrageous-stock-market-scammers/)

If you read over these stories, you notice they all run for many years, a lifetime even. Crypto has created many get-rich-quick millionaires. Why would you think crypto couldn't also create swindlers that made it into this list?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone is free to believe Kristy-Leigh Minehan's \[\*\] stories about ifdefelse and ProgPoW, in the same way that **we have to believe Satoshi had no secret deal with the US Fed**.  
\[\* Kristy-Leigh Minehan is the main proponent and only currently known public face of ProgPoW\]

Some of us like to say code is law, or code is money. We like to think of ourselves as ""better"" than the traditional banks and state institutions. So ""code is law"" means that criminals can write the laws? Code is money means swindlers can directly mess with the creation of money now?

When you want to become board member of a traditional bank, you will be background checked. We laugh about this because we are better?Kristy-Leigh Minehan would not stand the chance of being considered, given all suspicious evidence out there.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start somewhere. She says about herself  
[https://www.corescientific.com/team](https://www.corescientific.com/team)

\- ""has been writing optimized cryptocurrency miners since 2010""

Would like to see proof. github? sources?

\- ""In 2013, founded a company that became the **leading provider of hardware optimizations for GPUs** and ASICs"".

Leading provider of hardware optimizations for GPUs? Sorry I may be old fashioned but that leads to dozens of questions in my mind, if that is the same person who then comes forward saying ProgPOW is an attempt to bring mining back to GPUs and make it fair again.

\- ""founded Mineority Group, achieved over 100M annual recurring revenue""

That was the company that went bankrupt? Kristy-Leigh Minehan herself yesterday said ""a host of people think she embezzled money"" but ""they don't understand business"". hmm.  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/a27lhb/so\_ohgodagirl\_and\_the\_mineority\_group\_is\_failing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/a27lhb/so_ohgodagirl_and_the_mineority_group_is_failing/)

\- Why is an ex-employee of her saying he or she ""**got a rare insight into the evolution of ICO and cloud mining scams**"" ?

[https://www.glassdoor.de/%C3%9Cberblick/Arbeit-bei-The-Mineority-EI\_IE2404190.11,24.htm](https://www.glassdoor.de/%C3%9Cberblick/Arbeit-bei-The-Mineority-EI_IE2404190.11,24.htm)

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much more, some publicly available to the open-minded, and a lot more known and shared privately.  
""NO ONE CARES"" anyway, right?  
If the coin price recovers there will be so much money coming out of Kristy-Leigh Minehan's deals that it will be impossible to hide. Nvidia shareholder lawsuits will come, her friends at Nvidia will loose their jobs, Core Scientific can scrap their IPO plans. Ethereum will be impaired for good.

What is the identity of Mr Def and Mr Else? Another two Satoshis...  
We do have the voices of two of them in the developer call recordings on Youtube, a starting point.

&amp;#x200B;

If it turns out ProgPoW was written by Craig Wright, would you care?  
If it was written by Linzhi, a Shenzhen ASIC maker, would that be OK too?

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas how to back out of this mess?

Kristy-Leigh Minehan could resign from Core Scientific, come clean to the Ethereum Foundation, who could get a **written guarantee from Nvidia to not favor selected miners with secret optimizations or special chip deals, and only sell to all miners on an egalitarian basis through distributors**. The Ethereum Foundation might be able to get such Nvidia assurance because of the danger of shareholder lawsuits.

Someone will want to take some responsibility BEFORE it's a big story.

investing,Brace yourself for impact: Amazon's stock poised to plummet this year as the company continues its pivot from rapid growth to sustained profitability,"This sub is great to post in because it perfectly captures the animal spirits, and ironically if it is heavily downvoted and degraded in the comments, that is brilliant feedback for me because it shows the masses are still into the euphoria of short term headlines without realizing the stock is overpriced. Just a heads up as to my motivations for writing this post and the complete lack of respect I have for the opinions here as I've posted to buy Microsoft a year ago and everyone scoffed at me, downvoting it to oblivion and crazily upvoting any comments telling me I was wrong and deluded, then a year later I literally copy pasted the same post to buy Microsoft and it got thousands of upvotes before I deleted it, but by then gains to buying Microsoft now would be not nearly significant as had when I said to invest before it caught on. So the feedback here is good to know if I've caught something the masses haven't realized yet.

Amazon is about to crater. And the reason why Main Street isn't seeing this is because they are asking the wrong questions. The question they should be asking is: why is Amazon stock so expensive to begin with? And the answer to that is because of Amazon's unsustainable rapid growth. Investors see a company growing at rapid rates and want to catch the wave now as it continues to grow grow grow. This deception is conflated with the fact that people aren't sure whether or not to categorize Amazon as a retail company or a tech company, which is significant because retail has the lowest margins while tech has the highest margins. 

The problem with a grow grow grow strategy is that it's like empire building. Resources are stretched too thin, there aren't big enough markets to grow into which make sense in any sort of strategy, a few bad gambles can sink the company, but most important of all, the problem with a company getting too big through razor sharp margins is the chance for government regulation and monopoly busting. Now tech has caught regulators flat footed, but they are starting to wisen up, and wisen up fast. Gone are the days where an Uber or Airbnb or Byrd can take a city by storm, and postpone regulations on business models which skirt the regulations of normal businesses. 

Amazon's stock is about to fall off a cliff not because of anything fundamentally wrong with the company, but because Bezos understands that he has to shore up that rapid growth with strong fundamentals like better incomes, profit margins, and lower cost for revenue. And as he does this revenue is not going to keep getting ridiculously large, and it's going to spook investors who are there wanting to ride the wave of a rapid growth company. And this is already happening: in the last conference call Amazon reported exceptionally improved numbers in income, profit, and other statements, but a lower than expected growth in revenue, and because of this, the stock dropped. 

Amazon is a good stock, but no way at this price. It's PE ratio is whack, some days being at 382, other days being at 82, and at a certain point Bezos cannot fend off the inevitable, he knows Amazon's growth phase cannot be a forever phase or it risks collapse, and as he continues to pivot Amazon to a sustainable business model with better margins and less rapid expansion, investors thinking they are riding a wave are going to freak out, sell their stake, and Amazon's stock is going to plummet back to earth. And it's not like anyone is waiting for this to happen: Bezos has already done this in incrimental steps the previous few quarters and the guidance for next quarter literally said investors will be disappointed with their expectations for revenue growth.",finance

personalfinance,Question about whether I should buy a home or continue to pay off student loans?,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am 30 years old and am considering buying a house.  However, I have student loans, and I'm not sure if I should pay those off first, so I would love some advice from y'all.  I currently have about $100,000 in student loans left.  The amount is comprised of a number of different loans with interest rates ranging from about 5.4% to 7.2%.  My current monthly minimum payment is about $1500.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I have been talking about buying a house so that we can have more space, build equity, and eventually be in a place where we could start a family.  We found a house that we love, and have enough saved to put down a sizable down payment, but after the mortgage, taxes, homeowner's insurance, etc., our monthly costs will increase by about $1000 per month (from about $1600 to $2600).  We make pretty good money, so this by no means will hamstring us too much.  Even if we were to purchase the home, we would still be able to save a good amount of our paychecks after accounting for all other recurring costs and discretionary spending (assuming we keep it reasonable) that we could save/invest.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is that it would if I do both simultaneously, I will be paying significantly more in interest over time, since it would take me significantly longer to pay down both the loans and the house.  On the flip side, it could take another three to four years for me to pay off the rest of my student loans, and at that point, we would be ready to start a family, and I would prefer to be settled into my home before that time comes.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think?  I appreciate any advice.  TYIA!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  Thanks everyone for your input.  It seems like the best course of action for me right now is to pay down my student loans while living more conservatively.  Appreciate the advice, everyone! :)",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my car with my tax refund?,"Tax Refund / Return /s

- Income after taxes: $51,250 (Wife + Me)
- Current Debt:  Student Loans ($51,000 total), Cars ($9,200 total)

We have good credit (mine is 760 and hers is 761)

We have an emergency fund already in savings of just about $5,000 and our contributions to our savings account is about $1,200 per month right now.

Student loan repayment for me begins in July, for my wife - it starts in August.  It should be about $225 per month, all-together (graduated repayment plan)

I currently owe about 5200 on my car, on which I pay $305 / month.  The interest rate on my loan is 2.6%.   

We owe about $4000 on my wife's car, on which we pay $195 per month at 3.1 %

I would like to use my tax return of approx $3,700 + next months savings of $1200 to pay off the remainder of my car loan.  That will free up the $305 and bump our savings up to $1500 per month.  Ideally, after 3 months, we could then also pay off the remainder of my wife's car loan and be up another $195 just as our first student loan payments come due.  

Having the extra $500 per month free to use as it's needed is the goal.
After the student loans are due, there will still be about $275 available for savings each month.

Ideally, we can then put the 275 + the 1200 into savings to boost that up further for additional financial security.

Is this the appropriate way to go about this?",finance
personalfinance,How to minimize NIIT by MFS on our Long Term Capital Gains (NYC)?,"I'm trying to determine what would be the most tax-beneficial way to handle the following scenario:

\- We live in NYC

\- I receive RSUs from my company, which I've actually held on to (since vesting) for a few years now and would like to start liquidating a portion of my positions

\- I estimate my capital gains (long term, all lots were held for over a year) will be \~ $47,125

\- For 2019, I'm expecting the top tier of my income to fall into the 35% tax bracket, while my wife is expecting to fall into the 22% bracket

\- I understand that due to my income (&gt;200k), I will end up paying at least: Federal tax = 15% + 3.8% NIIT = 18.8%, State Tax = 6.85% and Local tax = 3.88% (if not slightly more)

\- Our goal was to diversify our investments a bit and to re-invest the proceeds via a new non-retirement brokerage account, which I HAD been planning to open up in MY name, prior to understanding how Long term capital gains are taxed.. (our 401ks, Non-deductible IRA contributions for Roth back door and HSAs will be maxed in 2019\*)

**Question 1a:** I understand that there's no limit on gifts that are transferred between spouses and that it isn't contingent on filing status, correct? (MFS vs MFJ) If that's correct, am I mistaken in thinking that I should simply have MY WIFE open the new brokerage account under her name and have her re-invest the proceeds, in an effort to avoid any potential NIIT taxes on any LTCG moving forward?

\- **1b**: Assuming we can take advantage of the unlimited gift deduction, the best practice moving forward when my RSUs vest would be to sell for cash upon vesting and give the proceeds to my wife to re-invest, right?

**Question 2a:** In regards to the remaining RSUs, which have vested, and I've elected to hold on to - would we gain any potential tax benefit in transferring those from my brokerage account to my wife's, so that she holds / sells in the future?

\- **2b:** I was a bit confused here, as I thought I might have read that even if we transfer the stock from myself to my wife, I would still be on the hook for any taxes (again, the main difference being the NIIT I believe?) once sold (by her), is that true?

\-**2c:** How does it work if they've appreciated to a certain extent now and they appreciate even further after the transfer, am I responsible for the initial appreciation and she would consume the appreciation, post-transfer?

**Question 3:** When I sell stock and realize LTCGs in a given year, is it only ""hurting"" me in the sense that I now am responsible for the LTCG taxes in that year or is it a double-impact, where it's also ""increasing"" my total income for the year (+$47,125) and somehow generating more fed/state/local taxes as well? I was under the impression I could simply look at it from the LTCG tax aspect and not count it as additional income (as it pertains to other taxes).

Are there any other potential strategies I'm missing here, with the main goal being to utilize my wife's lower tax bracket, while filing MFS?

Any insight/clarification would be greatly appreciated, thank you very much in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Credit card consolidation and auto loans,"So I'm approaching 3 years after graduation, and have had a job since day 1. I leased a car since I had no credit score to speak of at the time, and am approaching the time where I'll be looking to turn the lease into ownership through an auto loan.

One hiccup is that I've gotten a bit of credit card debt (about 3.5k on my cards, and 4k on a card that was used in college for what i'll call an ""emergency purchase"".)

The cards aren't going up, and i've been paying them down pretty steadily, but it's still pretty slow going since so much of my paycheck goes into student loans. It's hard to snowball debt when you have a ton of different payments (I have 3 student loan sources, all federal, and 2 different cards).

Yesterday I received a call from my bank about debt consolidation which would let me turn all that card debt into a single lower interest loan. On paper it seems like a really good option for me (I have solid steady income, and am not adding the to debt). 

My first question is, will I potential hurt my credit enough to be a problem for the upcoming auto loan? I am currently at about 730 on my credit score. Is there a reason I should wait, or not do the consolidation at all?

Secondly, is there a downside i'm not seeing with the consolidation loan? Is it really more profitable for banks to retain steady paying debt holders to the point where they would throw away a good chunk of their interest over the next few years? (i'd be going from a 12% APR card and a 24% APR card (yes it hurts) to something like &lt;10% APR).

I really appreciate any advice! If it makes a difference in what I should do, I make about $73k a year in the midwest, have about 40 grand left in student loans, and the car i'd be buying will have a value at the end of the lease of around ~13k.",finance

personalfinance,Did I get an unfairly high auto loan rate?,"I am a 24 year old with limited knowledge of the inner-workings of the automotive industry. I was pretty hasty in purchasing a new car and I’m suffering from a bit of buyers regret. I totaled my first car after skidding off an icy road and had just broken up with my boyfriend two days prior to that, so I wasn’t in a great place to make financial decisions, but I just wanted to fix things as soon as possible.

Anyway, on to the details. My first car was purchased in 2017, it was a 2008 Mazda 3 with 75,000 miles that I purchased for roughly $7,000. I put $2500 down and because I did not have any credit cards to my name at the time, my entire credit history was based on my student loan payments. Neither of my parents wanted to co-sign, so my interest rate was 10% APR. I was fine with that because I knew I was going to inherit roughly $24,000 in four months, so I paid off the $5500 remaining on the loan in a lump sum when the inheritance came in. 

Fast forward two years later. I have three credit cards, two with higher utilization percentages and one with low utilization. My student loans are paid off (due to the inheritance). I totaled my Mazda and wanted to replace it as soon as I could. I went to a dealer (still shell shocked), having done some research on cars that I may be interested in. I purchased a 2017 Kia Forte with 33,000 miles for $12,700 plus a $1700 down payment to cover the taxes, title, and fees.  My credit score was 749 at the time of purchase and has since bumped up to 755. I felt rather rushed through the financing part of the process and am still a little muddled about it all. The loan carries an interest rate of 6.7%, and after doing some online research, it seems like that may be high for someone with my credit score. My credit profile is not extremely diverse or extensive, but I had begun paying my student loans in 2014, paid off in 2017, opened my first credit cards in 2017, and have been using and making regular payments on them since then. 

Did I get a bad loan rate for my credit score? Or was the limited credit history a factor in the higher loan amount? 

TLDR; 749 credit score, 4.5 year credit history, loan rate of 6.7% on a 12,700 loan for a used car. Was this a bad rate?",finance

We were told that opening a secured credit card account with out bank would be the best option, so we both applied; I got approved, she didn’t. Apparently, it’s impossible to get a secured credit card without monthly income even though you have the funds to back up the card, which in my opinion is ridiculous.

We decided to sell to take advantage of this, and to upgrade to a bigger house, sell our condo, to take advantage of the market we were in thanks to advice here.  In addition, we were right below the capital gains cutoff, which helped us decide this route.  Our original investment was 250k.  We sold for 450k.  

We bought the new house first, then we finally just closed on the condo after moving in.  

When all is said and done: 

* We took Our original Mortgage of 200k is being paid off as part of the sale
* Our second Mortgage for the new house itself is 400k @ 5.15%
* Our payout after fees for the condo is 225k

What is the best next steps? 

* Should we just immediately pay the 225k down from the 400k Mortgage, leaving 175k @ 5.15%
* Should we refinance our existing Mortgage in some way with this money (either before or after paying down the amount?)
* Should we take any or all of this money and put it elsewhere?

Most of my confusion comes from how interest rates work and how discount points work.   For instance, a quick google search shows we could get:  

* 15-Year Fixed Rate	3.875%	4.001%

I don't know if this enough of a jump to focus on refinance, or when the right time to do that, when calculating fees, etc.   

Also of note:  We plan to pay down our mortgage aggressively.   We can probably monthly put an extra 3k-5k down against the principle.   I put the numbers of a 175k loan through a fast payment calculator and if we did 5k extra every month, we could conceivably be done with the loan by 2021 saving around 190k in interest - but I don't know if we could save more through other means, or maximize profits by investing elsewhere, etc. 

Thanks for your advice.

personalfinance,"If my federal student loan isn’t accruing interest, is there a benefit to paying it off now rather than later?","I’m 19 years old. I dropped out of school and live at home and my parents are currently covering my food/rent. I work at a commissioned sales job and currently have almost 10,000$ in savings. I’m most likely going to return to school at some point, but I’m not sure if it will be next year or the year after. I’m planning on going to community college and then transferring as I’m extremely fearful of falling into the millennial death trap of student loan debt.

From my one year of college I have a federally subsidized student loan (which to my understanding means will not accrue interest as long as I make my payments) that I have to begin making payments on next month. The total for that loan is 6000$. My payments will be somewhere in the ballpark of 200$ a month, which I can easily afford currently. That said, I am planning on leaving my job and moving sometime within the next six months (without getting into too much detail, living with my family in my hometown has not been good for my mental health.) When I move, it’s extremely unlikely that I will be making the kind of money I’m currently making. I don’t think I’ll miss student loan payments as long as  I live frugally but it will make my budget much tighter because I’ll be paying for my own rent and probably be making around 10$ an hour at some sort of service or retail job. If I return to school, I won’t have to pay that monthly fee again until I either graduate or drop out again (which I don’t plan on doing if I return.)

My question is- would it make more sense to take my savings and pay off my loans right now or would I be better off investing it? They’re not accruing interest, so is there any other downside to paying the monthly minimum that I don’t know about? Could it negatively affect my credit?

Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,How Will Student Loan Refinance Effect Credit?,"Hey everyone, I have a bit of a dilemma. My wife and I are looking to purchase a house in a medium COL city this summer. I would like to maintain my healthy credit score to get a good interest rate on my mortgage. However I also have plans to refinance my student loans to almost halve my current interest rate. Will refinancing the loans today have that much of an impact of my credit score that it may affect what interest rate I get on my mortgage?   


For reference, my credit score is 740, and the largest factors bringing it down are the average time of open accounts, and my student loan interest to principal ratio. So refinancing would alleviate the second, but worsen the first.  

 It seems like the system is just so biased against young individuals since I can’t do anything about my length of credit history. Any and all help appreciated, thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"$6500 in savings but more than $10,000 in CC debt. Attack it all at once or keep some savings?","As the title suggest we have $6,500 in our savings. We also have over $10,000 in CC debt that we are working on eliminating ASAP. My question is, should we throw all 6K at it right now? Or chip away at it incrementally in order to have some cash on hand in case of emergency? 

I am also due an annual bonus in April worth $5,000 so we could potentially be debt free if we put all of the cash we have towards the debt. A break down is below.

&amp;#x200B;

Capital One Card: $4890 (0% interest rate until April - balance transfer promo) Monthly payment minimum: $50.00

&amp;#x200B;

Discover card: $5,000 (14.75% APR) Monthly minimum: $100.00

&amp;#x200B;

Tally: $3,000 (14% APR) Monthly payment: $189.00

&amp;#x200B;

Klarna: $800 (0% interest if paid off by December) monthly payment: $100

&amp;#x200B;

If we were to eliminate this debt it would free up $440 per month that is going towards debt, not to mention how much we would save in interest over time. Currently we are able to save about $750 per month, so we could replenish our cash fairly quickly. Is it a better idea to pay off our debt now all together? Or slowly chip away?

&amp;#x200B;

It is just a hard decision to part with the cash and see our savings drop to $0 for the time being, but the feeling of being credit card debt free will be amazing. Advice?",finance

personalfinance,Parents credit card debt,"My parents are small business owners and recently got in over their heads. 

Their company isn't doing great at the moment but it's projected to get better come spring. The problem is that my parents have already built up their credit card debt bailing themselves (personal) and the company (business) out during the slow winter. Now their credit card debt is at an insane level, almost up to the number of my student loans but at insane interest rates.

There's no way they can pay off this debt quickly as they will have to pay their taxes soon and when the company starts making money again it'll be enough to just get through that time and paying their house/bills. I honestly don't think the company is that profitable but they will not look into alternatives as my dad is very hardheaded and refuses to listen. I've tried to get them to go to small business financial counseling or talk to an accountant but they just don't see the point when they're getting by and don't want to feel criticized when they're helpless like right now. I'd like them to get this help so they can ask the SBA for help as they've never even been in touch with them or in the future ask the banks for loans for their business instead of using their credit cards for everything.

They've been denied personal loans at their top 5 bank and their credit union to try to pay off their credit card debt. Honestly, I think even if they got the personal loan they'd pay off the credit card debt and rack some more up trying to bail themselves out again.

What are some alternatives that you guys can think of? I'm pretty sure we somehow have to force my dad to get in with a psychologist because he's just been acting weird and making horrible financial decisions. What other forms of debt consolidation are there that you guys may know of?",finance

personalfinance,Deductions for freelancing and stipend,"Last year my income was fairly complicated. I had a full-time salaried position for about 3 months. I made $5800 in 2018 at this job. I have paid taxes on this income and may be eligible for a refund.

Next I had an internship with a living stipend for 6 months, totally to $4800. This position was with the federal government and I was paid directly by the US Treasury. I was not taxed on this income. My understanding is that I only have to pay federal income tax (\~15%) for this income. I also purchased a car and drove across the country to this job, which cost $5000 and paid about $2000 in car insurance over the year.

Finally I started freelancing in November and have been doing so since. Before 2019, I billed \~$1000 and was paid about $500 (the remaining invoices were paid in January 2019). My understanding it that I will have to pay **\~30% (federal income + self employment) on the $500 I received before the new year.**

Throughout the last year I also had income from dog sitting, totaling around $500. I believe this is taxed the same as freelancing, and **can be treated as the same sole-proprietorship as the rest of my freelancing income.**

First of all, I want to check that my assumptions about stipend taxing and freelance taxing are accurate.

Secondly, Can I simply take the standard deduction of $12,000 and apply it to both my 1099 and stipend income, effectively cancelling that entire tax burden?

In terms of other deductions if I were to not take the standard deduction, how much of my vehicle purchase can I deduct? What about insurance? Is it worth trying to maximize my itemized deductions if my earning is so low and I can already cancel most of it with my standard deduction? Do section 199A or the new pass-through entity rules effect my situation?

I know this is a lot of questions and I hope I have asked this in the correct way. I realize that these questions are better suited for a CPA, however I cannot afford one currently. Please just give any advice you can on similar situations. Please feel free to ask clarifying questions.

Instead, 7 years later, almost nobody knows about it.","In 2011 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) asked to crack the Ricky McCormick code, for which I - under the hashtag #fbicode - asked Dr. Sue Black to collect codebreakers. Dr. Black should be known to most users of this subreddit as the woman who saved Bletchley Park. Indeed, I visited said historic landmark in 2012 but did not meet her there, as she was unable to schedule time away from her work.

You can see her entry here where she calls for the help of all codebreakers.

He posted it as a comment on a Google Doc, and I reported it to the FBI. I never heard back from the FBI, and they seemingly also didn't inform any news outlet or post it on their website, as nobody ever heard of the code having been broken.

&gt; Hi, its been 4 years, but here is an example of the method

&gt; Started with breaking up CTSE-WSE-FRTSE

&gt; I then associated numbers to letters: A=1, B=2, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt; Starting with CTSE  
&gt; C=3  
&gt; T=20  
&gt; S=19  
&gt; E=5  
&gt; Keep 3 cause its the smallest and first number T-S=1  
&gt; E-1=4 (See how I repeated that twice? That is the “law” of 2 and you’ll see it again and again in this code, and its the reason he repeats letters twice in patterns.)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; WSE; W=23, S=19, E=5  
&gt; 23-19=4 (the law of 2) add 4+4=8, then 19-5=14(the law of 2) &gt; 14/2=7  
&gt; again…(the law of 2) You get two 7’s….the answer is 877

I need your advice.

I have a car loan that's waaay too high at 10.99% for 72 months. I was wondering if there is anything I can do to lower it now that my credit is better.

Backstory:

I took out a car loan through a dealership for a 2012 Ford Explorer in Sept.2017. The loan was for 5 years at 13%. Didn't have a choice at that time as me and my partner needed a car ASAP and didn't have money to pay for a car upfront except a $1500 down payment. My partner crashed it in Dec 2017. Insurance covered the car cost and we got a 2017 Chevrolet Equinox from the same dealership at 10.99% for 72 months. This was over a year ago and I feel that I am in much better place financially now to get a better loan. I spoke with the bank where my loan is directly and they cannot lower the interest rate as I am locked in for the remainder of the loan term.

What can I do in this situation? Do I refinance the car somewhere else? Do I return the car and take the loss and get something with a lower interest? Just looking for a solution to this if there is one.

*Capital Gain: 325 – 225 – 28 = 128k

*Depreciation Recapture Amount = 28k * 25% = 7k

*Long term capital gains amount = 100k * 20% = 20k

*Total Taxes 20k + 7k = 27k



Taxes if sold when FIRE’d – Assuming 2019 tax brackets

From Home Sale
*Depreciation Recapture Amount: 28k

*Capital Gains Amount: 100k

Other Items

*Taxable Dividend Income: 8k

*Standard Deduction: 24k

*Mortgage Interest (Primary Home): 21k

*Property Taxes: 10k
Tax Calc

*Income: 28k+100k+8k = 136k

*Deductions: 24k + 21k + 10k = 55k
Im not sure here if I can deduct my mortgage interest and property tax against capital gain and/or depreciation recapture but I assumed yes

*MAGI: 136k-55k = 81k

*Taxes on Depreciation Recapture: $0

*Taxes on Long Term Capital Gain: $0

*Taxes on Dividends: 81k – 78.75k (2019 15% capital gain bracket) = 3.25k * 15% = $487



So in summary my taxes on the home sale went from $27,000 to $487. Is my calculation correct?

What confuses me is that say I want to start the certificate with $1,500, according to NFCU's calculator, at the end of the 12 months, my certificate would only have $1552.42 in it.

gaming,Lets Talk: Apex Legends,"Hey guys. I know 50% of you are genuinely interested in what I'm going to say, and the other 50% are fed up with Apex Legends posts on r/gaming. Listen, I am just giving my opinions, and what does and doesn't work. If you don't like it, don't read. Also, I am on mobile, so don't hate me if everything gets jumbled together.


Anyway, Apex Legends is a great game. Released last week, it has hit huge. Part of that is Battle Royals have exploded. However, it has started to die out. Apex Legends is not your run of the mill battle royal. The best way to describe it is that Call Of Duty had a three way with Titanfall and Overwatch, and nobody knows the parent, so they raise them together. You combine Blackout with Overwatch powers, and Titanfall abilities and BOOM, you got Apex. What does this mean for Battle Royals? Its not the same. I was a fan of Blackout until I played this game, and they are completely different. Blackout is a semi- strategical game, but most of it is who can get the best gun. Apex however merges Strategy with the fact that anyone can win with the abilities. You could have a pistol, and kill a guy with a shotgun if you use your abilities right.


Also, Apex is a squad based game. You can't play solo, because then it tales out the strategy. The callout system and the dropping system only backs this up. 

What makes this Battle Royal different? Everything stated above, combined with the community. Fortnite has been destroyed by their mainly toxic 10 yr old community that wants to ""troll"" or ""prank"". Blackout is characterized by their community of ragers, as it would go in any CoD game. Apex on the other hand, you can't hate each other, or at least its very hard. Dying, yeah it sucks, but then realizing you guys had the same abilities and they outplayed you, you calm down. It makes you thrive to get better. 

Apex Legends as of now is a great game. Community is supportive, and not toxic. It brings a different feeling to BR. If you havent tried it yet, I reccomend it. Even without friends, you will make em pretty quickly on here.",technology

personalfinance,Anyone seeing discrepancies in TurboTax vs CreditKarma?,"My wife and I got (officially) married Dec 19th of last year, so this is my first year doing our taxes jointly. I decided to use both TT and CreditKarma to see what the numbers played out like, and I'm getting a huge difference between them. They're both relatively close on state taxes (refund for each), but there's an $8k difference between them on the federal return.

For the life of me, I can't figure out where that difference may be.

&amp;#x200B;

Our returns are relatively simple:

\- we both have a single W2

\- she has some (large) stock sales on a 1099-B (RSUs, mostly income; only about a net $2k of short term gains)

\- I have some (tiny) income on a 1099-DIV and 1099-INT

\- We both got a refund from the state last year, totaling about $3k combined

That's about it. No house, no dependents, no out-of-state income, nothing else crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Switching IDR while working toward PSLF,"Hi, I've just completed my first year working in state government and I'm considering switching from IBR to REPAYE.  I've filed my second employer certification for PSLF, I'm printing everything, and triple checking with FedLoan on every phone call that my loan, my employer, my IDR, and my payments all qualify for PSLF.  I have one direct loan with a 6 figure balance from law school and the interest is shooting past my monthly payments; but I'm at peace with that.  Because my eggs are in the PSLF basket my goal is lowering my AGI (via above the line deductions) so that my monthly payments are as low as possible. Although the program is on rocky footing I do believe those currently ""enrolled"" will be allowed to finish.

 My income went up in 2017 and so when I rectified my IBR this past November (with 2017 tax filings) my monthly payments went up from $75 to $245. I want to get that lower.  I've just filed my 2018 taxes and with the deductions I made my income is lower by about 6K.  I'm thinking I'll change to REPAYE for the 10% disposable income cap and to take advantage of this lower AGI.  I know its going to recapitalize my interest (about 25K since I consolidated in 2015) but is the 10% disposable income cap going to be more of a gain if lowering the monthly payments is the goal? I think REPAYE will also save me more in the future as I anticipate steady pay increases.  Another option would be to just rectify my IBR with the lower tax info and stay put. How do I even crunch the numbers to find out the best option?

personalfinance,How much does a UTMA brokerage account hurt college financial aid?,"I'm 17 and have a UTMA brokerage account with vanguard and am applying to colleges. If you don't know what a UTMA is here's the definition from vanguard, 
""Custodial accounts under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) allow you to save on behalf of a child for education or any other purpose that benefits the child (other than parental obligations such as food, clothing, and shelter).""

I already had a Roth IRA with vanguard but wanted to open a brokerage account for general investing. However there's no such thing as a ""custodial brokerage account"" it's called a UTMA OR UGMA and this is what the vanguard call line suggested I should do when I asked about opening a custodial brokerage account. 

The problem is these accounts can significantly hurt your college financial aid because they're part of my assets. The other catch is the only money being contributed to it is my money I earned from my job. It isn't money from a guardian being invested on behalf of me like the account entails. I'm not investing much into the account ($300 so far) so I wouldn't think that could hurt my federal financial aid. 

You may be wondering why I couldn't wait a year to open a brokerage account myself and it's because I believe I would lose the ideal opportunity to invest in AMD stock @ $16.

35yo single mom, two years ago, zero debt, other than school loans. Today, 20k in credit card debt. I may could’ve resolved this on my own a few months back, but applied and received two new credit cards instead. 🤦‍♀️ Now, my payments are enough that I’m struggling, and only able to make minimum payments. There is an interesting inverse relationship occurring with my credit score and debt. 😕 I was hoping for a personal loan with a low interest rate, but have since a) been denied numerously and b) realized I may actually be delusional, thinking that exists. That’s been my past week... I’m now thinking debt consolidation company, which in the past week of research, I still cannot tell if it’s different from debt settlement, debt management, etc. I have read that debt settlement is the worst thing in the world (please stay engaged, I’m a touch melodramatic) because the party acting on your behalf, will not pay creditors for months and your credit score is no longer of any use, whatsoever. However, debt consolidation is a fantastic option because it reduces your total costs, while morphing your previous insurmountable payments into one comfortable payment and collaborating with the involved creditors, and everyone ends up benefiting. You know, as long as you don’t accidentally select a company that’ll take your money and leave the creditors coming after you for an increased amount, due to interest and late charges. From what I’ve read, this process begins fairly quickly and some creditors aren’t willing to settle for months. See? Then, they’re using the word “settle,” and I begin to think I’m being tricked. Anyways, my credit would be affected, only for about six months, then increase. But... increase to what, exactly? Better than the score to which it’s currently plummeting? Or, better than whatever it tanks to during this process? Also, all of my accounts will close out, I’ll lose all the rewards I’ve been saving, lol. Priorities.

Bottom line: (Lucky you, if you thought to skip to this) I’m certainly feeling overwhelmed. I would genuinely and greatly appreciate anyone’s expert advice or personal experience. I am not sure which route is the best to take. I’m so apprehensive that my decision to obtain a debt consolidation program by the end of today has turned into me thinking I should try to just pay it all off (knowing I cannot afford that right now) myself. What companies/routes are most reputable and least damaging to my credit and sanity?

I currently work two jobs, and obvs take care of a child. I’ve ordered a Dave Ramsey book, to at least prevent a reoccurrence, should I ever escape the current situation. I don’t necessarily want a quick fix, or to take advantage in a negative way. I just want to have faith in a solution that’ll work out, while letting me afford life today and have decent credit in the next two years.",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing or trading in a car?,"So I just want to preface this that I was 19 with a 500 something credit score and 1500 down when I first took out this car. So it’s safe to say I didn’t fully understand interest and the way of doing things so I’m still trying to understand and learn. 

I saw a post earlier about a car loan and the OP had an 11% interest rate and everyone said that was crazy so I decided to look into mine and I have a 24.63% APR (I assume that’s the interest rate). Almost $10,000 in interest is pretty insane in general. I Took it out August 2017 and should have it paid off November 2022. The car is in pretty good condition and an 09 Honda Accord. 

I’m wanting to trade in the car for a more family friendly car but I’m not sure if it’s a good idea? I’d be transferring it to my husbands name (if possible?) since I no longer have income and his income is more than what I was making at the time I took the car out. His credit score is in the 500s and our payments are in good standing with our current loan. 

I suspect we won’t get the full amount of the car back so that would be added onto the new car we’d be getting therefore just adding more to what we’d be paying. 

I do want to go and see what would happen if we’d trade it in and go from there but I also want to hear from you guys and what you think bc I’d like to have a better understanding of how all this works, what I should look out for, etc. If we don’t like how it sounds or the payments go up more than what we’re willing to pay I’d rather refinance but I’m also not sure if that would be a good idea. I just need some guidance and understanding. 

The principal of the car is a little over $12,000 with the estimated interest almost $10,000 for the total cost of a little over $22,000.

personalfinance,Calculations on when to pay off student loans,"So I have about $60k in student loans which are half way through their 30 year repayment plan. Currently, the rate is 4.23% and I can pay it off now. 

I started doing some calculations to see at what interest rate I should pay them off vs keeping the money in an S&amp;P 500 index fund. I'm not eligible for deduction on the student loan interest.

So here are my calculation:

Current principle: $62,326

Interest over 15 years @ 4.23%: $21,761

Returns over 15 years if invested at 3%: $34,775

Returns over 15 years if invested at 5%: $67,245

Returns over 15 years if invested at 8%: $135,382

But I need to factor in taxes. To simplify, I'll assume most of the returns on an S&amp;P 500 or total market index fund will be treated as long term capital gains at 15%.

3%: $27,820

5%: $53,796

8%: $108,305

But that's not all. interest rates on Stafford loans are variable.

Interest @ 5%: $25,779

Interest @ 6%: $32,115

Interest @ 7%: $38,264

&amp;#x200B;

So after all that, here's what I took home from this experiment:

1. Someone should really make a pay-off-loan-vs-invest calculator so it doesn't take all this work to figure out.
2. Even at a rate of 7%, it still makes financial sense to keep the loan if you're invested with a return of 5% which brings to question the conventional wisdom of treating 4-5% loans as good debt and anything above as something you should pay off. Maybe we should be a little more liberal on that recommendation.
3. For student loans, keeping the loan would make even more sense if you're able to deduct the interest.

Of course, just because it makes sense on paper doesn't mean everyone should be keeping 7-8% interest loans. There are definitely other factors that should weigh into that decision. I also didn't factor in potential taxes from ordinary dividends since that would get really complicated. Also, 5% returns of 15 years is in no way a guarantee. But that being said, every time I look at the rates and I'm tempted to pay it off, I'll have to remind myself of these calculations.

Edit: I know most people don't feel the same way about debt as I do. I have another loan at 1.5%. I'd only pay interest and no principle if I could!",finance

personalfinance,Tax questions about money received in 2018 from an old commercial,"I used to be an actor but changed careers in 2013 - FYI, it was the best financial decision I have ever made. Follow your dreams, but have a solid backup plan, kids. In Spring 2018, I received a call from my old commercial agent regarding a settlement from an ad I did back in 2011. Turns out, the sneaky jerks were recutting the same commercial and reusing the footage without paying residuals. 

My agent got a settlement of $20k. According to the W-2 I received, FICA, Medicare and SDI were taken out (totaling $1,730) and a very small amount of $15 was taken out for Federal taxes, so I know I’ll owe big time there. However, my old agent took out a commission of 10% of the original $20k (FYI, that’s a totally fair and common percentage in the entertainment industry) so I was left with $16,255. 

So, how should I claim this on my taxes? I was taxed on the $20k, but my agent took $2k after taxes. Can that be written off? If so, any idea where on my tax forms? Also, I haven’t lived in CA for over five years. Will I face double state taxes from CA and my current state on this? I haven’t found any documentation on anything like this, so I’m a little lost.

investing,Retail sales drop the most since September 2009,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/14/us-retail-sales-drop-in-december.html

* * *

U.S. retail sales recorded their biggest drop in more than nine years in December as receipts fell across the board, suggesting a sharp slowdown in economic activity at the end of 2018.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday retail sales tumbled 1.2 percent, the largest decline since September 2009 when the economy was emerging from recession. Data for November was revised slightly down to show retail sales edging up 0.1 percent instead of gaining 0.2 percent as previously reported.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales increasing 0.2 percent in December. Retail sales in December rose 2.3 percent from a year ago.

The December retail sales report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. No date has been set for the release of the January retail sales report, which was scheduled for publication on Friday.

Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales dropped 1.7 percent last month after a slightly upwardly revised 1.0 percent surge in November. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have jumped 0.9 percent in November.

December's sharp drop in core retail sales suggested a moderation in the pace of consumer spending in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, increased at a 3.5 percent annualized rate in the July-September quarter.

Gross domestic product estimates for the fourth quarter are around a 2.7 percent rate. The economy grew a 3.4 percent pace in the July-September period.

In December, online and mail-order retail sales dropped 3.9 percent, the biggest drop since November 2008, after increasing 2.8 percent in November. Receipts at service stations dived 5.1 percent, the biggest fall since February 2016, reflecting cheaper gasoline prices.

There were also declines in receipts at clothing and furniture stores.

Receipts at restaurants and bars fell 0.7 percent and spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores plunged 4.9 percent, the biggest drop since September 2008.

But sales at auto dealerships rose 1.0 percent in December after advancing 0.7 percent in the prior month.",finance

So I have been really lucky. Through a combination of tuition reduction benefits and scholarships, I am in a position to graduate debt-free. Since I know very little about financial planning and how to best build a good financial portfolio, I am looking for advice. I currently have 4000 in a savings account in a big bank (though I will switch to a credit union because the interest rate is pathetic). I will also probably get around 6300 per year doing on campus jobs (planning to graduate in 4 years). What kinds of things should I do to best take advantage of my good fortune?",finance

So I got divorced earlier this year and had to redo my W4. I will be filing as Single Head of Household with a dependent. I make ~$55k a year. Using the personal allowances worksheet, I come up with a 7 as my total number of allowances. I did run through the IRS Withholding Calculator as well and it seems to confirm that my current withholding is correct, but my parents seem to think 7 is a crazy number. Can someone please just let me know that I'm doing this correctly? And if I'm claiming 7 on my federal should my state (North Dakota) withholding by 7 as well?",finance

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this  stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(90d)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past 3 months. The column “Tx(90d)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last 3 months. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past 90 days, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on. 

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.",finance
personalfinance,What are the best options for someone like my dad?,"Hello PF,

My dad is 56 years old. He works doing manual labor, and makes decent money, roughly $200 a day, 7 days a week. He works entirely off the books, and his employer just gives him money at the end of the week based on how many days he has worked.

The thing is, he's getting up there in age, and he has hip and knee injuries that I know are going to get worse quickly, and he's going to be unable to continue the work that he does in the future.

He has no education, and no retirement. He has $15,000 in savings, but he's about to pay off his car loan. It has a 20% interest rate, so I told him to pay it off immediately, since there is only $7500 left on it.

His apartment is $1,100 a month.
And his other monthly expenses, including food, transportation, and miscellaneous bills are roughly $600 a month.

EDIT: I forgot to mention he also gives my mother $1,200 a month, since they are separated and she had previously relied on his income, and she very much still does, just to a lesser extent than before. They have a good relationship, and this will presumably continue.

What would be the best course of action for someone in his position? He does know how to use a computer or anything.

What would be the best way for him to save so he has something in the future? Any advice?

Thanks all.",finance

personalfinance,Advice on HELOC - I am financially clueless,"I have about 136K left on a home valued at about $350K.

It's a 30yr mortage on a 4.625% fix rate opened in 2010 but I pay a little extra towards the principal each month so it should be payed off in about 13 more years.

We're planning to take out a 40-50K HELOC to finish the basement and put in a play room, office, update the laundry area and put in a half bath.  To both increase the living space for our growing family (We have two young boys) and increase the home's value.

&amp;#x200B;

So, questions:

1: Can I get an ELI5 on the pros/cons of getting a HELOC with ""Interest-Only"" payments vs ""Principal and Interest"" payments?  I assume the advantage with Interest-Only is that I get a lower monthly payment and can choose to pay extra towards the principal each month.

&amp;#x200B;

2: Seems that most banks offering a HELOC have variable-rate APRs.  Is it possible/worth it to get a fixed rate?  Variable worries me.

&amp;#x200B;

3: Someone was telling me I could also re-finance to a 15yr loan plus the money I need to get the renovations done.  Not sure if that makes sense given my currently low fixed interest rate and how much I have left to pay (13yrs).   And I guess 3a: How would that work, exactly?  I mean it's not like I can write checks against a mortgage to pay the contractors, right?

I contacted my bank to let them know that my PayPal was hacked however the charges, about $1,500 (for a college student that's a lot), were not showing up in my account so they couldn't do anything yet. I opened a case via PayPal and their response was that they would get back to me by next week. I changed my passwords to both my Paypal and email however I still feel vulnerable. Paypal suggested that I report to the Federal Trade Commission, which I'm in the process of doing. I emailed the company that the payment got sent to however there's no contact with them. Furthermore, I keep getting his confirmation emails stating his name and address. Is there anything else I should do about this?

personalfinance,Question about auto loan rate shopping,"I'm a first-time car buyer. I've been shopping around for a bit but don't have a specific make or model picked out. Planning test drives next week and that will likely make up my mind pretty quickly, so I'd be likely to purchase within a couple weeks after that. Was looking to get loan pre-approval so I put in a request on Lending Tree. After getting a few pre-approvals for a $35,000 loan with interest rates a bit higher than I liked, I'm realizing the monthly payments would be more than I want to pay. It would probably be better to go for a loan of $25,000-30,000 instead. But would submitting another loan approval for a lower amount ping my credit score, or would that still be considered ""rate shopping"" and get scored as one inquiry? What if I decide to look at a different bank or get financing through the dealer? Or if I find a deal I like on a used car instead of new? How much of an impact could I see? Right now I have good credit (717) so a relatively minor penalty probably wouldn't hurt too badly.",finance

It recently raised its interest rate to 2.2%, while Citizens' Access is at 2.35%. Both have very similar CD rates and (from what I've read) decent customer service for an online bank.

Unlike Citizens' Access, Ally offers an app, checking accts, and has no minimum, but if I don't care about those things, is there any reason to go with Ally over Citizens' Access? Are their rates \*generally\* higher and the 2.2% v 2.35% is just one aberrant data point?",finance

Graduated in 2009, loans kicked in 6 months later. South Carolina State loan with a fixed interested rate of 3.25 - 3.5% with the auto draft discount of .25%.

Situation:

Last year I got a letter saying my loan was sold to Firstmark, everything would remain the same, go about your business, Blah, blah, blah, blah. I go, setup the account with a username and we're good.

A few months go by and I notice my monthly autodraft has been $30 more than usual. I log into the Firstmark and I notice that my interest rate was variable and jumped to 5.5-5.75% on most of the loans and as high as 7.25 on another.

personalfinance,Effective PMI Return on Investment if I pay down principal on mortgage,"All,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to figure out what the return on investment is if I pay down my mortgage enough to rid myself of monthly PMI payments.

&amp;#x200B;

Each month they cost me $180, and I'll be paying them for about another 3 years, so, a total of roughly $6480. To pay down my principal enough to get rid of PMI payments, I would need about $25K. My knee-jerk reaction is that the ROI is roughly 26% (6.48K/25K).. but a little higher because I'm also not paying interest on that $25K. If my mortgage interest rate is 5%, is my ROI to pay down my principal then roughly 31%? I feel like I should stop dumping money into the stock market because I'll never average 30% returns. Does this seem right?

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment,"I have read a number of different posts on this subject, and I seem to have a good idea of what i should be doing or the process, but I thought I would post anyway to see if there's any other takes on what I should do here.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have 2 small federal loans from school, totaling about $3500.  I was having some issues repaying a few years ago, went to default, loans got moved around, I believe the servicing company was called ACS.  Fast forward to about a year ago, my online banking (where I had checks set up to pay my student loan) was having problems, didn't complete 2 months of checks to the loan company so it got moved again.  I don't blame it on my bank, its my job to make sure this is all getting paid, but that's besides the point.  Loans get moved to Navient, and all payments have been made on time to them since its moved there.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am moving out of the country (USA) in about 2 weeks, I don't think I'll ever be moving back but I definitely will be here to visit at least once a year.  I am trying to settle up all debts before I leave, which is basically this and my car.  I have enough savings where I should be okay, but i obviously want to do anything that I can to keep as much savings as possible since I don't know how long that I will be without a job.  I am thinking two things that I can do here,

&amp;#x200B;

1. Request a Verification of Debt letter from Navient as I have a feeling that they wouldn't be able to provide it
2. Call and try to ask for a settlement amount as I believe that they are considered a collections company and being that they probably paid less on this than I have even paid them interest already, maybe I can be done with it for half or so.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm mostly worried about the timeline of settling this after I've already left, or looking for tips on negotiating a settlement amount.  I was thinking I would call them and tell them that I am leaving the country and I want to settle the debt, but I cannot cover the total amount and see if I can talk it lower.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway all tips and discussion is appreciated and thank you for your input and time.

I read that domestic partnership premiums paid for by the employer are also taxed as income federally. I made a 101k last year and the premiums paid for by my employer for my dp were 9k (rounding both to simplify). So my federally taxable wages on my w2 is 110k. 
So to find out what my dp should pay monthly I took the 9k added at the end of the year to my gross and multiplied it by my tax bracket at the end of the year (24%) and got $2160. Divided monthly, it came to $180.

worldpolitics,Central Bank of Central Banks,"The royals and nobles in Europe have been concealing trillions in private bank accounts in Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein. They provide loans to the Bank for International Settlements which then provide loans to banks. Through this fraudulent system using interest rates and fees they steal taxes from nations. The Erlach family are an old Bernese Swiss nobility that ruled in Berne for centuries and were involved in politics and military. They take their name from the town of Erlach which produced a division of Swiss Guard and mercenaries that served German princes and the French monarch. Today their Erlacherhof mansion is the office for the mayor of Berne. The family still lives in Switzerland and is involved in banking and law. Rudolf von Erlach and Andreas von Erlach are international corporate lawyers. The company CMS von Erlach Poncet operates in Switzerland providing tax law services internationally and is headed up by Chairman Cornelius Brandi. Cornelius Brandi is an expert with corrupt loopholes involving tax law and financial transactions and he is a ruthless psychopath with high authority over banking in Switzerland. Ernst Brandi and his son Albrecht Brandi were involved with the Nazis. Ernst Brandi was a top member of the Secret Meeting of February 20th which were German industrialists that organized the financing of the Nazi Party. The Nazis were involved in creating and running the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. Banking in Switzerland is private and enables the concealment of wealth and more importantly making criminal pay offs which they conceal as loans. The BIS works as a middle man for smaller banks for international transactions as well as with central banks. The Bank for International Settlements has major leverage over central banks. It is called the central bank for central banks. Criminals working at CMS von Erlach Poncet are the advisers for Swiss bankers and their clients. Eric Sarasin is of Swiss nobility and involved in wealth management, banking, and tax advisement. Count Philippe de Felice-Grin-Ruttley is a Swiss noble with Italian titles and works as an international lawyer. He worked for Rome, United Kingdom, European Union, and currently works for Ince &amp; Co.

The Gutzwiller family are the top Swiss banking family and they own their Gutzwiller private bank headed up by  Stephane Gutzwiller and Francois Gutzwiller. The Gutzwillers also manage about 35 other Swiss banks with Jurg Gutzwiller as CEO of Entris Holding. Some top criminal Swiss bankers include Baron Frederic Hottinger and Baron Rodolphe Hottinger as the primary owners of Hottinger &amp; Cie Groupe Financiere and Financiere Rodolphe Hottinger. Peter Hottinger is the CEO of the global wealth management company called Pilotage. Prince Lorenz of Belgium is a managing partner at Gutzwiller Bank in Basel, Switzerland. Archduke Sigismund of Habsburg-Lorraine covertly manages Swiss accounts for some royals and has been covertly overseeing Landolt &amp; Cie Banquiers. Arch Duke Rudolf von Habsburg-Lorraine runs Triple A Gestion in Switzerland with his brother. Prince Eric Sturdza of the Romanian Sturdza family owns the Swiss Banque Eric Sturdza. Baron Benjamin de Rothschild owns Edmond de Rothschild Group and handles finances of criminals in Israel. Prince Maximilian of Liechtenstein is an owner of Liechtenstein Global Trust which includes Swiss branches. Lorenzo Rocco di Torrepadula is from an Italian noble family and works at REYL private bank in Switzerland. Eric Sarasin sold his family's Swiss bank Bank Sarasin &amp; Company to the Safra family with Joseph Safra who is worth about 24 billion. Safra Group has about 70 billion in assets. The Sella family of Piedmont are a merchant banking family which established Banca Sella Group in Italy with offices in Switzerland and they are working as the Court Factors for the merchant-banking House of Borromeo. The architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach designed Karlskirche or Saint Charles Church dedicated to Cardinal Charles Borromeo. ABN AMRO is primarily owned by the Dutch House of Orange-Nassau through proxy share holding companies and has a Zurich branch. The Nassau-Weilberg family of Luxembourg have part ownership over some banks in Luxembourg where banking is also private. Mid Eastern royal families also have proxy banks set up all over Switzerland and keep their hidden wealth of trillions from oil profits usually in private banks in Luxembourg before being siphoned through the BIS.

These banks are in contract with other larger Swiss banks including the Bank for International Settlements which is located in Switzerland and it works as a central bank for dozens of central banks around the world and is siphoning off wealth and redistributing this wealth as payments to criminals and criminal government agencies disguised as loans. The BIS is involved in siphoning off wealth from nations through fraudulent tax contracts and also oversees and regulates international financial transactions which are used for making bribes disguised as investment loans. The BIS provides loans to governments used for financing oppression, militarized gang stalking, and criminal military operations. Charitable foundations are involved in making criminal payoffs as well. These pay offs go to regional or local managers of secret societies and criminal organizations which tend to be Freemasons, papal knights, royal knights, and crime bosses which all generally own private businesses. They receive payoffs and bribes disguised as loans which they then distribute to their wage earners in secret societies and organized crime through cash or fake online donation accounts and these wage earners are involved in organized gang stalking, harassment, vandalism, making threats, spreading propaganda, cyber stalking, hacking, censorship, and even murder. So if an investment firm gives a loan to a private company and that company never pays it back and the investment company does not go after them it was probably a bribe or criminal financing. This is similar to what the Nazis did in Germany. The German-Swiss Baden-Zahringen family were the founders of Berne, Switzerland and the Erlachs work for them. The German Hohenzollern family ruled Neuchatel, Switzerland and they established Deutsche Bank which was in a Nazi contract with the BIS during WWII. The House of Hohenzollern have a portion of covert ownership of the BIS.

The Bank for International Settlements has foreign agents from various nations involved and especially agents from Italy which lead this international criminal banking movement with Mario Draghi, Fabia Panetta, and Ignazio Visco as Board Directors for the BIS and they are all connected to Rome. Agustin Carstens is the General Manager of the BIS and a Mexican banker. The Bank for International Settlements is designed as a tower and really operates as a loan tower managed by the Torlonia banking family of Rome. The Torlonia family are the treasurers of the Vatican and they have French ancestry. The House of Torlonia owns the Banca del Fucino in Rome. The word Tor in French means tower and lonia is similar to the word loan. The Torlonia name means Loan Tower which is what the BIS is. Prince Giulio Torlonia is President of the Banca del Fucino  and a top overseer of the Bank for International Settlements. Both Switzerland and the Vatican City State used the square shaped flag and the Swiss flag is the same as the Italian royal family's coat of arms. The Torlonia family are intermarried with the royal family of Luxembourg and Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg worked for the IMF and former Minister of Finance in Luxembourg Luc Frieden was Chairman of the Board of Governors for the IMF and World Bank Group. The BIS works with the IMF. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group are both headquartered in Washington DC and operate in the same way making criminal pay offs disguised as loans to corrupt bureaucrats and politicians managing nations and also loans to corporations for the purpose of globalization and enabling organized crime. The Group of 30 oversees the IMF and World Bank Group. Mario Draghi is a member of the G30. Cornelius Brandi and his criminal tax counsel are enabling these crimes and he is a German relative of the Venetian Brandolini family of Venice. John-Maximilian Henry Fane de Salis the 10th Count de Salis-Soglio is a Swiss-Italian-Holy Roman noble. His father was a Knight of Malta whose wife was of Venetian nobility. The House of Savoy are the Italian royal family and they live in Switzerland. The Savoy name refers to savings. Prince Emanuel Filiberto of Savoy has the official title of Prince of Venice.

personalfinance,"Buying house. Disputed charged-off ($650) Chase card from 2013. Debt was verified, FICO dropped ~50 points.","I'll try to make this as brief as possible. I have been in the process of rebuilding my credit over the last 6 years and I've also been saving for a house for about 2 years now. I finally have enough for a down payment and I even got pre-approved for a pretty nice mortgage from NFCU. When I applied (Jan 10, 2019) my FICO 9 score was close to 700. Not high enough for the best of the best rates, but high enough to get me in a house this year. Around that same time I also opened a dispute through credit karma regarding an old charged-off Chase card from 2013 as well as a Discover card that I had settled for less than the full amount back in 2014. The dispute for the Chase card came back last week and the results were: 

&gt; Result: Verified As Accurate And Updated - It looks like this item is actually correct and that it's going to stay on your credit report, but info has been updated to reflect recent activity.

This item has been on my report for almost 7 years now. I wont get into how I managed to not pay off $650 but regardless the account was closed and charged off by Chase. My problem now is that I got my new FICO scores this month (I have been checking since I'm buying a house) and my FICO 8 scores dropped to ~630 across Experian and Equifax. 

Experian's report shows the following: 

&gt; Jan 7, 2019: 680
&gt; Jan 21, 2019: 621

Where the only ""update"" they have to explain the drop is the following: 

&gt; Negative Payment Activity
&gt; We noticed 1 new negative payment activity on your CHASE CARD account.

In the details of that account it shows that the last activity date has been updated to Jan 16th, 2019:

&gt; Balance Updated
&gt; Jan 16, 2019

Equifax shows a similar drop, but their ""explanation"" is because of a negative remark added to an old Discover. The remark for _that_ card changed from this:

&gt; Comments
&gt; Account paid for less than full balance


To this:

&gt; Comments
&gt; Account paid for less than full balance
&gt; Charged-off

Basically the only thing my disputes managed to do was update the last activity date(s) on both of these accounts and now my FICO score tanked down to ~630. Am I correct in assuming theres no way to fix this before closing on a house when my pre-approval was given when my FICO was 690 and these disputes were ""in-progress?"" If not, I'm guessing I will either be:

* A.) Denied for the loan I was pre-approved for because of these score changes or 
* B.) My interest rate will jump up because of this score change?",finance

personalfinance,Refinance 5/1 ARM to 15-yr fixed?,"Hello all - I am considering refinancing my mortgage and would very much appreciate your all's input.

I purchased my home almost 5 years ago with a 5/1 ARM. The original loan amount is 169,000. The rate is 2.625%. It adjusts a maximum of 2% every year after 5 years. And the lifetime cap is 6.625%. I decided to take the risk that rates wouldn't change all that much in 5 years, so I got the ARM with the intention of making heavier payments to pay down the principal and then consider a refinance. That time is nigh!

Things didn't work out exactly as intended given I had some major life events shortly after purchasing my home. In any event, I have paid down the loan to about 106,500. It's not paid down as much as I hoped, but I'm pretty content with how it turned out. Predictably, the rate is now set to go up by 2% to 4.625%.

Here are my options as I see them:

1. I have a lender who is quoting 3.625% for a 15-yr fixed with no points and about $3,600 in closing costs (I'm going to try to negotiate on those closing costs; any thoughts on what arguments I could make would be appreciated!). Note: I plan to continue making extra principal payments every month under this option.
2. Keep my 5/1 ARM, taking the risk that rates will continue trending down as they have been for about the last couple of months.

I did some rough math with some assumptions on interest rates and timing of refinancing.

* If interest rates go down to 3% in 6 months, I would only see a net benefit of about $1000 (over the life of the loan) compared to refinancing now
* If they went down to my current rate of 2.625% in 6 months, I would only see a net benefit of about $2500 (over the life of the loan) compared to refinancing now.

Based on that, refinancing now seems to be the much safer approach. Please let me know what you think, and thank you in advance for any helpful advice you can give!",finance
gaming,Important question on the PS3. A bit miffed by how this thing seems to work.,"I'm the kind of person that just treasures games like gold. I care about the discs i get and would like them to last as long as possible.

With the PS3 Super slim i got yesterday, i'm worried about the longevity of these games i just bought. The way i have to remove them requires me to open the compartment as normal and tug on the side of the disc to ""pry"" the ring out of the hold. It bothers me that i have to do it this way because the discs bend, which means things could break if i do it the wrong way.

Is there a better way i can remove my games without risk of breaking them or creating chips or cracks on the inner ring?",technology
personalfinance,Should I pay off a huge chunk of my student loan using half of my emergency fund?,"I’m 27 and have saved up $11,000 in my EF. My debt breakdown:

* ~$30,000 in total student debt (fed loan and consolidated loan) 
* ~$9000 car loan

I pay $286 monthly for my fedloan and $120 for my consolidated loan monthly. 

I’m thinking of using about half of my EF to pay off 1/3 of my fed loan ($15,000) aka roughly $5000-$6000. This would lower my monthly and my fedloan has the highest interest rate (my consolidated loan comes 2nd highest in interest rate). 

Is this a good plan? My parents think it’s a good idea and even though my EF is halved I have very few risks since I’m still young. Worst case is I can always lean on my parents if things go south. Also, I plan to rebuild my EF of course over time. But is this a good idea?",finance

personalfinance,I (28) make an incredible salary but my job is affecting my mental health. Need advice,"I dropped out of college when I was 24 and was lucky enough to get hired by startup not for profit in the homeless shelter space in NYC. 

I have been working at the same company for 4 years now and for the first 3 years this job was amazing. I got paid off the bat 50k in my first year. The job had tons of flexibility regarding working from home since I didn’t have an office set up. This played out more or less for the next 2 years while the company became more legitimate. They got a large office and gave me one of the offices and I would come and go as I pleased. My salary was increased by like 20% a year and still had very flexible hours. 

During my third year I got offered an interview by a competing company offering me 118k. It was obviously just an interview but I was open to my boss CEO about it since I was only making 90k. He basically told me that if I took that other job they would fire me within 30 days since I wasn’t qualified and that I should stay with his company and he would match the salary. Looking back he was clearly gaslighting me. 

This past year everything changed. They started really cracking down on me. They basically got fed up with my flexibility and my COO in my opinion started really disliking me. At first they said I needed to come to the office every day, this was fine with me since they gave me a nice office and I had some friend. One day I have a meeting with my COO and she tells me that she’s making me a building manager of two buildings that they lease. That was fine for me but issue was that there was so much red tape I really couldn’t do anything but send emails asking for authorization. 

2 weeks after this meeting, my bosses COO and CEO basically yelled at me that they were doing my job for me. I’ve never been yelled at before and I tried in vain to explain to them that I can’t do anything since every process in the not for profit takes 3 weeks to approve.  They couldn’t give a crap and basically just wait for me to say I’m wrong and give up the fight (typical of them btw)

2 weeks after this I get an email from the COO saying I need to vacate my office within 24 hours and find an office in one of the two buildings basements. I tell her that I don’t have an office prepared and I have all my computer and desk items still in my office. She doesn’t care and basically says I have 20 hours left to vacate. I wind up bringing over $4,000 worth of computer stuff to my parents house since I had no office set up for me. It takes two weeks to set up an office and the COO doesn’t  even bother to help. 

I’m still getting a very generous salary so I say “ok, this is part of life. Everyone has bad bosses” I still have flexibility and go and come to the office as I please but do all my work. 2 weeks after this my CEO calls me into his office and I’m thinking “shit. What now?” End up being he gives me another raise ?? So now I’m making 130k and I’m very happy. During this raise he basically tells me I have OCD and very needed by the organization, basically describes me as autistic (??, never been seen like that by anyone ever ) I just shut my mouth and nod since I want this raise. 

For some reason the raise never comes. I wait two weeks until I email payroll and ask them what’s up? They say CEO never mentions anything. So I ask my CEO and the COO basically says I need to come in to meet with her for another evaluation 

This evaluation was a total shit show. Both of them are basically telling me that i do whatever I want and that they are sick and tired of it. My COO says that I don’t update her before she asks, even though she’s CC’ed on ever email. They then tell me that I am being changed over to Hourly since they don’t trust me anymore and that I need to send a daily update to my COO verbally and by email every day. 

So okay.... this job has become a bit crazy but it is what it is. Today as I was driving to one of the two sites I clocked out of the first and clocked into the second and my time didn’t reflect the driving time like everyone else in the org. I emailed my boss COO and she basically said that if need to travel I have to send an email to her explaining where I am going and the purpose of the drive. Every time I travel anywhere. 

I just want to get some perspective from others since I’ve never had another job before so I don’t know what it’s like. 

Is it usual to get yelled at about everything wrong you do? Do your bosses constantly put you down make you believe you aren’t good enough? 

People always talk about shitty bosses but I really do still have a great job. I make 130k a year and only work 40 hours which is amazing and unheard of. The only issue is that my bosses keep making me think I’m being fired and keep saying how shitty I am as an employee. I’m really confused why I got the raise and why right afterwards I got yelled at? 

Tl;dr: have a great job but crazy bosses. Need advice",finance

worldpolitics,New Silk Road,"The Northern Sea Route, also known as the Northern Passage, runs through the four seas (Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, East Siberian Sea, Chukchi Sea) and is the shortest route from Northern Europe and Siberia to Asia. In shipping, the Northern Sea Route is defined as “the navigational-recommended route from Novaya Zemlya to the Bering Strait”, and the Legislation of the Russian Federation - as “the historically established national unified transport communication of Russia in the Arctic”. The Northern Sea Route makes it possible to significantly shorten the delivery of goods from Europe to the Asia-Pacific region compared with the southern routes running through the Suez and Panama Canals.

After the collapse of the USSR, the military power of which allowed to solely controlling the Northern Sea Route (NSR), the main “battles” around the status of the Arctic and issues of navigation along the northern sea route are still unfolding in the legal sphere. The legal position of the Russian Federation provides a “broad” definition of the boundaries of the NSR water area, explaining that this path does not have a single and fixed route. Keeping its general direction, the NSR moves from year to year, and often during the one navigation, goes long distances in the latitudinal direction. Nevertheless, in any circumstances, the most part of this path passes through the exceptional economic zone of Russia, its territorial sea, or even in Russian internal waters, i.e., passes in spaces that falling under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. In the scientific literature there are three groups of arguments that determine the legitimacy of such actions of Russia. The first one substantiates the recognition of the NSR by its national communication in the Arctic from a historical point of view, the second draws attention to the presence of special legal rights and duties in this region of the Arctic states, the third bases on the impossibility of dividing the NSR into any particular areas and take into consideration its unity as a federal transport artery. 

However, the ""monopoly"" position of Moscow in the waters circumambient the northern coast of Eurasia, was contested in Washington. The US insists that this transport artery should be international. In the United States, they fundamentally disagree that such an important route is in the sphere of Russia's jurisdiction. The commander of the US Coast Guard, Admiral Paul Tsukunft said about it last year in April. Moreover, he noted that the US armed forces do not plan to conduct maneuvers in the Arctic ""to ensure the freedom of navigation."" It should be recalled that the Pentagon resorted to similar operations in the South China Sea in order to limit China's activity on the ""privatization"" of an important sea route. However, Russia does not interfere at all with the freedom of navigation in this area, and the NSR can be used just like any other maritime artery, observing certain rules.

In addition, Chine is interested in the Northern Sea Route too - Beijing is considering this route as an addition to the Silk Road project. Last year in January, Beijing officially announced plans to actively use the possibilities of the NSR. The main partner of China in this business, of course, will be Russia, which is actively developing the Northern Sea Route. Most likely, the success of the Northern Sea Route inspired Beijing to create the “Polar Silk Road”. Last year in December, the Russian president Vladimir Putin himself proposed to China to make the Northern Sea Route ""a silk way"" together.

China, of course, pursues its own interests and is trying to save on transportation, so the volume of transportation of Chinese along the NSR is growing. Some of people even see the threat in such an expansion. Theoretically, conflicts are possible with significant melting of ice, as well as the growth of China’s military ambitions. The use of the Northern Sea Route by Chinese warships may entail the intensification of the actions of other foreign states to ensure their naval presence in the Arctic.

Thus, for example, Russia and the United States have been arguing about the legal status of the Northern Sea Route for a long time, and this has had an impact on bilateral relations in the Arctic since the 1960s. The United States is trying to dispute these arguments and consider some straits - the Straits of the Kara Sea and the Straits of Laptev and Sannikov - to be international, to which applies the principle of freedom of navigation. Also, another argument for expanding Russia's sovereignty over the waters of the Northern Sea Route is that there are very harsh climatic and ice conditions on this route. Russia argues that the duty of coastal states is to ensure the safety of navigation and prevent possible environmental threats due to various kinds of incidents at sea: oil spills, ship collisions, etc. To shipping manage and to provide ships with hydrographic, ice-breaking and other support, the coastal state should get all the necessary information about the passing ships. If the passing ships do not fulfill the existing requirements, which pose a threat to the safety of navigation, Russia may not allow these ships to pass through the NSR.",energy
worldpolitics,Japan called the Kuril Islands the perfect place to deploy US missiles,"The Kuril Islands are ideal for deploying US missiles, Japanese media reported. If missiles are deployed on the islands, then the Japanese and Americans ""can defend themselves against North Korea's ballistic missiles."" In addition, the missiles on Kuril Islands will allow to block the port of Vladivostok- the base of the Pacific Fleet of Russia.

The four islands of the Kuril Ridge, claimed by Japan, may be ideal for deploying American antimissiles because of their geographic location. This point of view was expressed in the pages of the Japan Business Press. 

The deployment of US missile defense systems on the Kuriles will strengthen the defense of Japan and America against North Korea’s ballistic missiles, the article notes. At the same time, Iturup Island is best suited for a missile base.

In addition, American missiles on Iturup ""will allow Washington to block the port of Vladivostok - the base of the Russian Pacific Fleet.""

It is thanks to the four islands of the Kuril ridge that Russia controls the freezing Catherine Strait between the islands of Iturup and Kunashir, and Russian ships can go into the Pacific Ocean, the newspaper notes.

“If Russia gives up all four islands or even only three, with the exception of Iturup, then it is likely that Japan and the USA will block the Catherine Strait,” the author says. In addition, the deployment of American missiles and radars on the Kuril Islands will help the US track the launches of Russian missiles from the Sea of Okhotsk.

Federation Council member Oleg Morozov believes that the discourse on the possible deployment of American missiles in the Kuril Islands ""destroys the possibility of resolving the long-term issue"" in Russian-Japanese relations.

The senator drew attention to the fact that the authors of the material ""either work against Prime Minister Shinzo Abe from domestic political views, or give a signal to the Americans that the military-strategic benefits should push them to begin putting pressure on Russia.""

Valery Kistanov, head of the Center for Japanese Studies at the Institute of Far Eastern Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that Tokyo is being led by Washington after the end of World War II.

“Japan simply repeats what the Americans say. They have always been in the wake of the United States, since the end of the Second World War, in all positions of international disputes. Of course, this will be perceived negatively by the Russian side. No official will speak directly about this, but this will be taken into account,” the expert said.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said earlier that a peace treaty with Russia would also be beneficial for the United States. “The conclusion of a peace treaty by Japan and Russia will have a positive impact on regional stability. I think this will be a plus for the United States,” said Abe. He added that at present Russians live on the four Kuril Islands, but the territorial problem will continue to exist until part of them goes to the Japanese side.

The four islands of the Small Kuril Ridge — Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, and Habomai — are called “northern territories” in Japan and are considered illegally annexed. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia repeatedly stated that Russian sovereignty over the islands has the appropriate international legal framework and is not subject to doubt.",finance
personalfinance,Federal Income Tax Withheld Calculation - Totally Stumped,"Hey PF,

I am trying to make an excel sheet to calculate the FITW for my paycheck. I am confused because it seems like the employers tax guide for 2019 does not line up with the tax brackets for 2019. And so its throwing off the way I am doing my calculation.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the Table from IRS Publication 15 on page 46. This is Table 2- BiWeeekly Payroll Period

|OVer |But Not Over|The amount of income tax to withhold|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$146|$519|$0.00 plus 10% over $146|
|$519|$1664|$37.30 plus 12% over $519|
|$1664|$3385|174.70 plus 22% over $1664|
|$3385|$6328|$553.32 plus 24% over $3385|

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the income tax table

&amp;#x200B;

|If Taxable Income is Between|Tax Due is:|
|:-|:-|
|$0-$9700|10% of income|
|$9701-$39475|$970 + 12 % above $9700|
|$39476 - $84200|$4543 + 22% above $39475|
|$84201 - $160725|$14382.50 + 24% of amount over $84200|

&amp;#x200B;

My question is why do the values in row 4 of the income tax table and the values in row 4 of the Biweekly payroll table not line up? What I mean is $3385\*26 = $88010 where in the IRS table this number is at $84000. It seems like each one is \~$3800 greater in the biweekly paycheck table

&amp;#x200B;

I am filing as single, with no dependents, and no one is claiming me as a dependent.

According to turbotax, my files have been accepted by the irs but are still being reviewed. I am recieving the refund via direct deposit.

I would really appreciate any help as to what to do, I've never done my taxes before and am kind of scared panicking as to what's going to happen to me, I don't want to be fined or audited or anything like that. I don't make much since I work a simple part time job as a cashier.

personalfinance,"$28.9K in a savings account, debating Online Savings Account, CD, or MMA.","Hi /r/personalfinance!

I currently have $28.9K in a Chase Savings Account, with a low low interest rate of 0.01% I believe. I would like to make my money work, by putting it into an account that has a high rate. From what I’ve looked at in this subreddit, there are online savings accounts with 2%+ rates, CD’s with 2%+ rates, and MMA’s with 2%+ rates.

My current situation is that I am in my senior year of university working full-time making $2,000-$2,500/month, and I currently live at home with my parents. I do not pay rent, although I do pay my fair share of car insurance, health insurance, and phone bill, which totals out to $350/month—credit card bills can be $300-$350/month (fully paid off monthly). I am able to tuck most of my earnings away into my savings account monthly. At this time, I am currently saving towards a down payment for a future home, that I plan on purchasing in 1-2 years. I would like to have my savings readily accessible and available, should I need to actually use them (gives me a sense of security knowing that I can have fall-back money to land on).

Being that I would like to have my funds readily available, a CD that locks my term in, is most likely out of the equation since I have to pay a penalty for an early withdrawal. This leaves me with an online savings account with a high rate, and an MMA with a high rate. I believe both act the same as a regular savings account, but I am not totally clear as to which would actually be better for my current situation. I have looked at Ally, Discover, and Marcus by GS’s savings accounts, and they all offer 2%+ rates. For MMA’s, I’ve only looked at Capital One, and CIT (I think?), being at 2% as well.

Any input is greatly appreciated, and please correct me if any of my information about these bank accounts are wrong. Thank you very much for reading, and I hope you have a wonderful day/night!",finance

Upon looking into them they do a lot of shady practices and I don't recall ever getting a letter or phone call from them but this was more than ago so who knows. My main problems are that they gave me two separate accounts for one bill, they split the ultrasounds into two separate accounts despite it being all done at once just listed separately for medical record.

They're charging me $152 each account when I know for a fact I have already paid $42 of it through the hospital. I contacted the hospital and they said they hadn't gone through with the collections as of August so on August 10th I made that payment but it's saying the account open date is June 20th, and that's definitely not when I had the ultrasound done as that was in February or March.

personalfinance,Need advice on new job and income that is life changing for my family.,"TL:DR at the bottom. 

To start off I need to tell everyone that my family has hit rock bottom.  This last August while at work traveling from one jobsite to another a woman traveling in the opposite direction and texting on her phone veered into my lane coming over a blind hill at approx. 75+mph in a 35mph zone, killing the driver in front of me and totaling my work vehicle.  Landing me in the hospital with tons of medical bills. 
Come to find out that lady had no insurance and my boss at the time had me driving a truck that was not only NOT registered as a commercial vehicle but also was not even HIS nor the company's. It belonged to his in-laws. And once the insurance company saw the pictures of the scene of the accident they quickly realized it was being used as a company vehicle as it had a full body wrap with company logos and number all over it. Then they informed me that I was not listed as an authorized driver of said vehicle and they would not be covering any damages whatsoever.  

For sake of keeping this as short as possible, let's skip six months ahead. 

After attorneys' fees, medical bills, lack of employment (I was suddenly ""no longer needed"" at work after attorneys got involved and ""laid off"") and just having shit luck that my Ex-boss decided to ""let me go"" during the absolute worst time of year for my profession, I'm down to nothing. 

When I say nothing I mean NOTHING.  My car was repossessed and shortly after my internet was shut off. Leaving me, my wife and two children completely stranded with no help. Luckily enough they're school bus stop is just a few blocks away or they wouldn't have been able to get to school.   Our savings is GONE, we try to utilize financial assistant programs offered in our area but all demand you show up in person. Ask neighbors (including landlord) for rides but get a bunch of ""sorry can't help"" and even some straight up ""not my problem"".  I live in a nice area. Not rich but nice and was friendly and social with neighbors for almost a year so this was a huge shock to me.    

Then my phone is shut off. Then my wife's phone.  I start walking to the closest pawn shop almost 4 miles away to pawn or sell anything I can just to keep us warm and fed.  

Two weeks ago I get served with an eviction letter from our landlord who had been working with us on the rent. I understand he has bills to pay as well but it was somewhat unexpected because we had established an agreement and we stayed in constant contact with him. (He lives next door)
I walked 19 miles round trip to go to court to get as much time to move out as possible.  Judge gives me two weeks since I have children.   
On my walk back a man had set up one of those ""free government phone"" stands on the corner and I thought I would see if I could get a plan for an old flip phone I have left after selling our smart phones at the pawn shop.  I not only got a service plan but also a cheap 20$ ""smart"" phone with 1gig of data! I couldn't believe my luck! 

At this point I had applied everywhere within a 2+ mile radius of my house. So when I got home I googled every possible variation of keywords that might give me companies in my career field to call. I've been in my trade for almost 18 years and have never been unemployed for a single day since I was 15 years old with a work permit allowing me to work after school.  
I wrote down every number I could find before blowing through my 1gig of government data in just over an hour.  At least a hundred or more. 
After calling dozens and dozens of those numbers I get an answer from a guy with a pleasant accent.  We talk about my job experience what type of work I'm looking for, ""literally anything I just need to feed my family"" is what I told him.  He agrees to meet me and offers to buy me lunch. He doesn't know how bad off I am. I see no reason to explain to him this ridiculously long story you are now reading. Plus I don't want this guy to think I'm unstable or unreliable. I'm not. I've always been employed and always payed my bills. 

Skip ahead just under two weeks. He comes to my house and picks me up three days in a row to show me how he runs his company and ""to see if I would be a good fit"".  The fourth day this man calls my fancy government phone and tells me he wants to hire me.  YES! FINALLY A JOB OFFER! 
This guy owns his own remodeling company and is doing quite well for himself.  But I expect to hear him offer me some job digging ditches for little pay and am wondering how the hell I am going to make it work every day.  He says he'll send me an email with a quick run down of what he's wanting and what he's offering. 
I walk to the nearest McDonald's about 2 miles away to use the Wi-Fi and wait for the email.  2 hours later he sends me these words that made me brake down like a little baby in front of a bunch of people sitting around eating their brunches.

Thank you for your time. Be blessed

Sincerely 
(New boss)

--------------------------------------------------------------

I immediately called him and had him send the contract to my attorney for review.  His secretary (or should I say OUR secretary) had it to my attorney before I made it back home. 

The next day he picked me up, we went to his office and met his attorney and signed the contract.  
He handed me keys to a brand new four door truck, the valet ticket, a 10k$ check, all of the electronics (all new in the box) shook my hand and thanked me. He thanked ME!

WHAT DO I DO NOW?! I was previously making 51k$ per year at my peak.  Now I will be very comfortably into the 6 figures. I'm sitting here writing this in my living room after spending all night packing and loading a moving truck because today is the last day I'm allowed to stay in this house. I offered to pay up the landlord and he redused. Now most of my families belongings sit in a truck outside with no house to take them to. I plan to cash this check as soon as the bank opens, get a storage building, a hotel, and begin looking for a house. But I only have until Monday to get everything moved into a house as I have to go to work and my wife is 8 months pregnant and can't do it and my other two kids are not even teenagers yet. 

Where should I start? What do I do with this kind of pay? Obviously I need to rebuild my savings but my wife also needs transportation so I suppose I'll need to buy a car.  Not to mention we have NOTHING for our new baby as of yet. 

Any advice would be sincerely appreciated!

TL:DR  My family hit rock bottom by no fault of our own. Ended up with no money, job, phone, transportation, or even utilities. Got evicted. By luck of the universe or whatever higher power there may be, I found an incredible job just in the knick of time. Everything I own is in a moving truck and must be out of this house in 7 hours. I have 10K$ a pregnant wife and two young children.  We need shelter and place to put our belongings.",finance

Wife 37 year old, not working to care for 2 kids while in vet school. (uncertain future income- best to not consider)

No other debts. 

 no 401k, no investments

&amp;#x200B;

we have choices, what would YOU do? We can't decide between REPAYE and Dave Ramsey style of debt pay off. 

What is the best way to use this 100k cash?

&amp;#x200B;

option 1- JOB OFFER 85k in KS.

Move back to home town, live in rental owed by mother in law- pay the principal of $900 month, invest 100k in IRA- refinance loans to a lower interest rate and try to pay $3k month with a 10 pay off? 

&amp;#x200B;

option 2- Move back to home town, live in rental owed by mother in law- pay the principal of $900 month, throw 100k cash at loans, making them $210k,  refinance loans to a lower interest rate and try to pay $3k month with a 5 year pay off? 

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3- live in mother in law rental, pay off the remaining mortgage of 100k with our cash, live RENT FREE, pay off loans in 3-4 years, sell house for around $260k (value at 230k currently- strong market) take all the profits and buy larger property with mother in law (she wants to retire)- 

&amp;#x200B;

Option 4- live in mother law house, rent at $900/mth, use REPAYE, (not married) pay average $600/mth for 25 years, invest  00k in IRA, pay max to 401k, save money and buy future house with cash @ 330k

&amp;#x200B;

Option 5 - JOB OFFER 97k -in  California, Job offer $97k with PRO SAL potential of $140k- use REPAYE on loans for 25 years-, Average rent $2k/mth. live in a small house, close to beach, mountains, fishing. invest 100k in IRA

\----or use the 100k and invest in a property - average 3 bedroom is 400k .

personalfinance,How to rearrange our (married couple) debt to max our credit scores.,"For simplicitys sake I'm describing my husband and my debt as separate. Weve been married for one year and havent really combined our finances yet, we are starting to do that but trying to figure out how to make it work FOR us and not againast us. 

My credit cards are paid off. 

I have credit lines: 
Regions: 2000 
Capital one: 3500
Discover: 6100. 

I use my cards for gas and groceries and  pay them off as I go. I was in trouble with credit and finally got on top of things about 6 months ago. 

I also have a student loan at 8% interest that is currently at $13k with deferred payments for another 2 years. I am putting $300-500 into this every month. 

My credit score is around 720. It was 520 6 months ago. 


My husband is also underneath himself with his credit. 

He has 6 cards, all maxed out, all high interest (10-25%) 

His total debt: $10k. 

His credit score is in the 500s, but he has never missed a payment and the super high balances are the only ding he has. 

We put our tax refund into his credit and got the 2 smaller credit lines paid off. We are down to $8500. 

My husband has NO money to put towards his credit. And all I can do is move over what I've been putting in my loan. 

We will be both graduating  next year ( him med school, me grad school) and planning to buy a house on a physicians mortgage at that point. Itll be a wall of text to explain, but we are confident this will be the right move for us. 

We need decent credit scores for this^ over 700 each. 

How do we go about rearranging the credit to make this happen? I've asked my husband to call all his cards and see if he can negotiate lower interest rates and any good kind of balance transfer. Hes planning to do that this afternoon. 

We can transfer to my discover at 0%interest for 12 months, at 3% fee. We could do this with what we KNOW we can get paid off in a year. But that's only like $1500. 

We are selling things and putting any spare cash we can towards this. But there is no guarantee. For instance, he has a motorcycle for sale, price at $11500 but no one has bought it for months and we have no idea when it will sell. Its priced low for what it is, but not that many people are out buying that kind of bike. This would obviously take care of the credit problem. Buuuut it has to actually happen. 

Halp?",finance
personalfinance,Question on Navient student loans,"So I'm working on paying off my student loans (who isn't?). When I made my payment today, I saw that if I ""activate ACH benefits"" I get a 0.25 percent interest rate reduction. Forgive my ignorance, but is this the same as signing up for automatic payments? And if I sign up for autopayment, can I still direct an overpayment? Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"Filed my taxes last month, just received my federal returned. Now, however, I received a W2 from a job I worked at in 2017 with my 12/31 paycheck showing up for FY 2018. This job was also in a different state.","I'm just really confused and annoyed. I didn't work at this job in 2018 at all, I quit the middle of December and got my last paycheck on the 31st. For whatever reason that paycheck got counted in January 2018, and so I got a W2 for about $2,800 or so. The job was in New Jersey. I moved to New York the first week of January and started working in NY that same day.


I already received my Federal returns and I'm expecting to receive money from New York state as well. However, now that I have a W-2 from Jersey, do I just file the 1040x and attach the W2 and the IRS will take care of it for me?


If not, I used CreditKarma and I don't think they let you file in two states, so do I have to file paper? Also, if I claimed 0 what is the likelihood that I owe anything on the $2,800 W-2? I'm moving most of my returns to savings, but I want to leave some there in case I need to pay back the state of NJ or something.",finance
personalfinance,Minimum Payment /w IBR on Student Loans = $0 -- How To Properly Avalanche?,"I have 8 (federal) student loans, and have recently qualified for an income-driven repayment plan. Based on my AGI, Navient has set my minimum payments to $0/mo. I am looking to intelligently use the avalanche method to pay back these debts; however, I am getting hung up on the typical avalanche advice.

It is recommended that one pay the minimum payments toward all their debt first, and THEN apply their extra $$$ toward the highest interest loan. Considering that all of my minimum payments are $0, should I be applying all of my $$$ toward my highest interest loan? Or, should I consider the interest accruing on these loans to be my minimum payments, and then apply the remaining $$$ toward the highest interest loan that I have?

I used a debt repayment calculator to play around with the numbers, and it seemed to indicate that the lowest-cost repayment strategy was to fully allocate my $$$ solely toward the highest-interest loan, and allow the other loans to accrue interest. If someone could please help me verify this, I would be greatly appreciative!",finance
personalfinance,"I keep getting calls and texts from a loan manager that my student loan payment is due, I’m a freshman",Granite state management has been calling me with automated voicemails and texting me saying I have a student loan payment due. My loan is a federal Parent Plus loan and is deferred until 6 months after I graduate. Is this a scam or something I should be concerned about?,finance
personalfinance,What should I pay off first?,"New poster here. After my paycheck and bills paid plus my taxes came back I’m going to have about $3000 left over to put towards my debt. But I’m unsure which order to tackle these in, any help is greatly appreciated. Here are the accounts with balance/limit and interest rate on purchases.

Capital one - $4397/$4500   25.15%
Capital one - $2867/$3000   19.15%
Discover -      $1315/$1500     21.24%
Chase -           $795/$800        29.99%

I also have a Walmart card with 2k on it but I’m unsure of the rate on it right now.

I can see pros and cons of doing the small ones first and being absolved of them however the bigger ones are heftier interest charges. 

My short term goals are a better credit score so I can find a balance transfer card.",finance
personalfinance,flowchart question,"Hi,

I've read the flowchart here, have created a budget for auto and food which are my necessary expenses, and have just made the small emergency fund goal of $1,000.  If you continue on with the flowchart, the next part that's relevant to me is the ""increase emergency fund to 3-6 months expenses,"" and ""moderate interest debt"" as my debts are in the 4% area.  

This article says an emergency fund is bad if you have debts first https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/123113/why-emergency-funds-are-bad-idea.asp

&gt;Clear Debt First
It’s easy to insist that emergency funds are crucial for everyone, while ignoring just what position the average household’s finances are in. If you’re carrying credit card debt, student loan debt, or both, then building cash reserves for the purpose of anything other than paying down those debts should be the last thing on your mind.

So I'm wondering what you all think, and what you would do?

Increase emergency fund, or pay off student debt?

I'm in IBR method right now, so there isn't a monthly bill, but I don't want to keep it this way.  I also know my highest interest rate loan.  

Thank you",finance
personalfinance,Wife Student Loan Debt ~100k How to proceed?,"Me 30 years old 45k salary. Mortgage is only debt. Wife 27 years old 15k-20k salary. 10k in private student loans (4 loans) and 100k in federal student loans.

We have been married 2 years and have a 7-month-old son. I work 40+ hours a week M-F. Wife works 3 days a week and takes care of child on the other days.

I have a house in my name purchased before marriage and our 2 cars in my name also from before meeting her. I live in a non-community property state. I do not believe I am responsible for any of her debt if I am correct. Is this correct?

Our current plan is as follows. Use the snowball method on the private loans while paying the minimum on an income-based repayment program for the federal side. Once the private loans are paid off, we continue to pay the minimum on the federal loan until it is forgiven in 25 years. Unless we see a large increase in income, I do not ever see tackling the 80k in federal loans. I will file our taxes married but separate to keep the payment plan only based on her income and to keep my larger refund from being garnished.

The drawbacks to this plan as far as I can see them are having to put everything in my name only in the future. Also, depending on what this does to her credit, our ability to get loans or credit will be based solely upon my score and my income.

For anyone that has experience in this, does my plan sound sensible?",finance

personalfinance,Am I being dumb with my massive loan payment?,"I borrowed money from my parents for school and then a car when I got my current job ($70k+) a long way from home. They set my interest rate at 4% and gave me flexibility in how much I pay off a month. I decided on $626 which would pay it off in 2.5 years (less than a year left). But, after living expenses (I live alone in the city), and 401k contributions I'm left with next to nothing going into a savings account or any other investments. In my head I hate having debt so I'm aggressively paying it off but given that I have control over my payments am I making a mistake trying to do this so fast rather than investing/saving more?

stocks,Ladybaybee stock picks for2-15-2019,"[Link to imgur with the picks](https://imgur.com/a/w9a6Dia)

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this  stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(90d)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past 3 months. The column “Tx(90d)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last 3 months. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past 90 days, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on. 

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions. 



HOW I USE THIS:
For the time being I am trying to keep things on the safe side. So I tend to go for the stocks that have success rate of 1.0, and more than 1 in Tx(90d), The Growth(90d) and Factor tell me how hot are the agents that are in charge of analyzing this stock are. Beyond this point, I also go for stocks with State equal to ready_to_buy because I make this to mean that the upwards tendency is just about to start so it has more potential to grow. State ready_to_sell isn't bad either, it just means that the system had detected the upward trend in previous days and it still thinks that the trend will continue this way.  The system doesn't actually tell me how long the upwards tendency will be. I run the models everyday at noon NY time, so the programs just tells me: ""I think you should buy this TODAY"" or ""I think you should sell it TODAY"" Just as an added heuristic, I tend to sell all my stocks on Fridays because I don't like the uncertainty that weekends and long weekends bring, but that is just a personal opinion.",finance
personalfinance,W4 assistance needed please.,"Hey guys,

I recently married in July 2018 and for the 2019 tax year I am looking to amend my W4 properly. For the 2018 year we are filing joint and we seem to owe around 1200. I believe I had claimed 1 for federal and 1 for state. I made 103,000 paid 15,400 in federal and 6,200 in state.  Which usually equates to 1200 per paycheck. She made 71,200 had 4,400 taken out for federal and 1100 out in state. Not sure how we still owe.

personalfinance,Best balance transfer cards/way to pay down debt?,"Hey guys,

So I have had a college card with Wells Fargo since I was 18. I'm 25 and married now, we are expecting our first kid in a few months. I've never really purchased anything on credit, but we had a few medical bills to pay and a vehicle related expense a year or so ago. I regularly throw like $500 at it a month but it currently still sits at $6,000 due to the 30+% interest rate on it. I've talked to Wells Fargo about this and they said ""this is the best they could do for me"" even though I have a credit score in the high 700's.

My wife was working but has recently quit in order to stay home and raise our child. I have a good job as an electrician. I'm still young in the trade but make 45K a year, and I live in an area where that's considered pretty comfortable.

We are in good shape financially, we have a decent amount in savings and don't have any crazy expenses, we buy everything used or second hand.

The only thing is this stupid credit card.

Do you guys have any balance transfer cards you'd recommend, or any way to pay this off? Like I said, I dump a bunch into this thing to pay it off but it's such a waste because of the interest rate. It's not a huge amount of debt in the broad scheme of things, but I'd prefer to be entirely debt free.

 Me no goody at understand construction loan turn into mortgage process. How work?

&amp;#x200B;

I am getting all my ducks in a row to start construction and just got approved for my loan, now I am a little nervous about not knowing what the interest rate will be once the new construction loan moves to a 30yr mortgage. 

So the way it works according to my bank is I pay a 6.5% interest rate during the construction phase of my build

 (a 9 month  process) once that is done my new construction loan becomes a 30yr mortgage, my issue is I will be subject to what ever the 30yr mortgage rates are in 9 months... and nobody knows what that is going to be. Right now it's like 4.75% which is fine by me , however if it become 6.5-7% in 9 months I' going to be royally F'd. Is this the standard way it works? Can I push to get the number locked in now? Anyone have any experience with this?

&amp;#x200B;

I just went through my chapter 7 and am not waiting to be discharged (we just need to file our taxes and we are waiting for one more w2 to be mailed to us). I should mention I filed jointly with my Girlfriend who I common Law married during this process. We we're evicted from our apartment last October which also forced us to file. We got lucky and were able to move into my Grandpa's house as he moved to a different state and was looking to rent out his house, we do not have a lease there and pay him $1,400 a month, we also have a roommate who pays us $500 a month. Since filing I found a new job with a major pay increase, went from making $48,500 to about $70,00 a year. My girlfriend makes $13/hour working about 30 hours a week. Since filing we have also gotten a new car with a loan that has a high interest rate (18%). We were told we could refinance after about 7 months to drop that down, we have made 1 payment on the car so far. Money is no longer an issue. We make enough and are much better at saving than we used to be so I am not worried about paying our bills but I want to make sure I go about building my credit back up in the right way.

All dates are in the Ethiopian calendar

These men were innocent victims of torture based on false accusations or shot at protests in the Amhara region during the tplf regime.

**Guy 1**: I was a farmer... They came saying I was keeping or moving Ginbot 7 (a political party) fighters. They took me to a hill/ mountain(terara) and beat me... they hit my head... i lost energy (zalkugne?) ... then they threw me off of a cliff.. thanks to the Pure Virgin St Mary, it was on her day, i landed on soil. And some one who had seen what they did to me went and reported it at home.

In another video (the continuation of this) he says soldiers took and ate his heard and talks about what's left of it.

""6 months i couldnt sleep... after 6 months my body healed but not my eyes""

**Guy 2**: They hit me at the correction center in 2008... the bullet went through and came out my back. (He's paralyzed)

**Guy 3** I'm a farmer, i was organizing people and speaking of democray and how we should focus on buying wheat rather than bullets. But the adminstration then would arrest us and let us go repeatedly saying we didnt have permission... my friend died... a certain official arresed me for 30 days after that they tore down my house. He had me beaten... they took my ability to have children... i told my wife she should divorce me and raise our child and that i would go to the monastary as a monk but she said i wouldnt get much food there and after reproaches here we are and now you have come.

**Boy 4**: ""i was hit in august of 2008, when i was in the 2nd grade. I was hit while i was herding cattle. There was some conflict and federal police came and that is when they beat me.""

**Guy 5** "" june 1983, i was a student. I saw the woyane(tplf) fighters remove the Ethiopian flag (the simple green, red , yellow flag)  and put up their own flag (the star flag) . At that moment , there arose a conflict about why our flag was removed and replaced by an unknown flag. They shot at us... 14 people died and several were wounded. June 2 they came to take me. They accused me of being EHAPA (a party). What they did to me... i was only a 10th grader, i feel so much hate fo these people... the hate i feel made me see these people as not Ethiopian. On ever stage and at every opportunity i would speak about their evilness "" (other parts show his hands are affected).

**Guy 6**: I cant understand much of what he is saying but combined with the other parts of these docu. He was shot at his mouth and on the back.

**Guy 7**: I ask my parent why did you call me Bizu ayehu ( it means ""i have seen a lot""), i get angry and tell them, you called me that and i am like this. They told me that my ""elder brother was taken by the Woyane (tplf) when you were only 10 days old so that is why i called you that.""... i went on a protest, they shot me. They shot me in the morning but for hours i was laying there bleeding. Finally some area youth took me to the hospital... They started to follow my little brother they waited for him and showered him with bullets, he ran and i have never heard from him again. They also did something to his other family members i think.

There's one other guy with a terrible injury on his leg too.

PM.Abiy's parliament speech

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WFMIYx0J0D8

""In Ethiopia, there is no person that has commited a crime, been declared a criminal, and has not been arrested. The only difference is, between being arrested by the government and arresting himself. I dont have a personal belief that such a person has not been imprisioned ... when you have killed and commited a crime your conscience wont let you sleep calmly ... limiting yourself to one place is self imposed imprisionment not lack of imprisonment."" If the person cant move around, meet his family... then it means he is imprisoned as imprisonment means confinement in one place. ""

""All regions are doing their best to hand in criminals. Some handed them over, some are in the process, and others have claimed the cant find the criminals,""

""If crimnal mr X was found roaming freely, the individuals or others who have seen him doing so and failed to hand him will be held accountable as accomplices (tababari). (Meaning Accessories after the fact).""

So if those who roam in a certain place and those who have seen them are not held responsible it means they are not criminals or at least have not been declared so?? Who exactly are the declared criminals so the people can differenciate them from the undeclared ones?

Well, one of the duties of the law or legal system is to make sure that neither the punishment nor the crime exceede each other. And who are these declared criminals really?? Who has been declared and who has not??

Also several billions of dollars are said to have been laundered leaving aside the rumours and accusations of the currupted organizations, i wonder how much of this was due to the ""declared criminals"" and how much of it was due to the undeclared ones.",energy

personalfinance,Oblivious military family trying to become financially savvy,"Hi Reddit,

So this is one of those ""Help me figure out what I should do""posts. I'm (26f) a veteran and my spouse (30m) is currently still in the military. Over the last year we've been really trying to hit finances hard since we spent a lot of my enlistment traveling or just having a good time with our money (we were both in at the same time). My goal is to be **hella rich**  (I'd like to have kids within the next 5 years and not think ""Oh shit how will I afford x,y,z"" and also take nice long vacations overseas or just be on my sofa playing video games)

&amp;#x200B;

Currently our savings looks like

* My Ally Savings: $6k saved | Spouse Ally Savings: $10k saved
* My Navy Fed CD: $3k (3% interest) 
* My Navy Fed Checking: $2k | Spouse NF Checking: $4k |Joint: $2k 
* My TSP: $17k - (C Fund) | Spouse TSP: $33k - (L2060)
* My 401k (roth): $9k 
* My Vanguard Account (VTSAX): $6k
* Vanguard IRA: $11k | Spouse Vanguard IRA: $5.5k

**I looked into rolling over my employer 401k into TSP since it had that option but I wasn't able to because TSP will only allow you to roll over traditional employers 401ks so I'm stuck with Fidelity.** 

Our income is: 

* My income (Bimonthly):  $2,114.57 | Spouse income: $1,642.16
   * My spouse and I are contributing the max amount with our employer 5% match 
* VA payment: $1.7k 

&amp;#x200B;

Our bills: 

* Mortgage: $1.4k | Food: $400 | Light (monthly): $80 | Water (quarterly): $100
* Car insurance: $233.45 month | Phone: $100

&amp;#x200B;

Debt: House - 200k / 4% interest 

In a few months my spouse will be deploying overseas. We intend to place 100% of his paycheck into the TSP because when you deploy to a war zone you can contribute up to 56k (You have to time it so you max out your roth first and then traditional). Hopefully they'll have like 70k by the time they get back from deployment. In the mean time, I budget about $3,652.62 monthly but I expect that will go down once my spouse deploys. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will also start school in the fall so my I'll get about 2k monthly for school for the next year and some change. If I budget 29k for 8 months and I'm able to just use my own money to pay I'll have a nice chunk of change left over from already maxing my 401k and IRA. Should I just dump it into VTSAX? I just opened up an investment account today with Ally and I was hoping to just buy and hold some stocks for the next 20+ years but I'm not sure if that's a good idea also. Is it better to just pay off my house early?

&amp;#x200B;

I could always just buy 10k worth of lotto tickets and just say fuck it I guess. ^((jk))

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinance Denial and Consumer Debt Payoff Advice,"Good afternoon, all! This is my first post here and I'm looking forward to hearing what you think!  


My husband and I have accumulated quite a bit of debt over the past 10 years, and now we are trying to dig ourselves out. We have a mix of consumer debt, student loans, one auto loan, and a mortgage. We obviously have a high debt to income ratio, and though we have made some progress with consumer debt, I'm trying to find ways to pay it off faster. My husband's job pays decently, but I am a stay at home mom due to the cost of childcare in our city. We pay almost $900/month in student loans, and the interest rates are far below what our consumer debt rates are. That made me think we should refinance our student loans, even if it is at a higher interest rate or for a longer period. That way we can pay down the consumer debts faster and then eventually apply the money that was going to consumer debt to our student loans.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's what we tried. We submitted a joint application to refinance our student loans, but were denied. We have excellent credit (750s), so I'm not sure why it didn't go through. I really wish they would tell you these things so you can fix them in the future. My guess is it's because I don't have a job, and though it was a joint application, I applied as the primary (but does that actually affect anything?). Also, our debt-to-income ratio is pretty high. To combat this (and as part of our debt-payoff plan), we've paid off nearly $7,000 of consumer debt since then. I also looked into refinancing just my student loan through my provider on an income-based repayment plan. I have everything in place to do so, but am still wondering if we should try to refinance all of our student loan debt into one, lower monthly payment.

&amp;#x200B;

With all of that said - should we:

1. Refinance just my student loan for a somewhat lower payment (about $200 less a month)
2. Try to refinance all our student loans again since we've paid down about $7,000 of consumer debt and our DTI is better
3. Pay the balances as they are and find another way to pay down consumer debt
4. Do something else

&amp;#x200B;

We are working incredibly hard to make a debt-free life a reality, living incredibly frugally and doing the cash-wallet system, but the student loan payments feel like a gut punch every month. I'm starting to see some money come in from my blog, but I don't want to count on that for debt repayment purposes, since online income can be pretty fluid. Anyway, that's enough words for now. Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Best way to spread around credit card debt of $60k?,"My sister fell for a scam and maxed out most of my credit cards, totaling $60k across 6 cards. I feel all sorts of rage and frustration, but right now I need to figure out how to deal with the scam debt that's now on my accounts. My sister is unable to help financially and pursuing legal action is not an option.

&amp;#x200B;

$13k is on a 0% APR Amex card that will change to a higher APR in Dec 2019. The rest are all on high interest cards that I usually don't carry a balance on (I play the points game and pay everything off monthly) so I need to transfer/pay the remaining $47k balance somehow before April to avoid interest fees.

&amp;#x200B;

I make \~$100k/year and think I can comfortably afford $1000/month in extra payments for this scam debt, but ideally want to minimize the monthly payment (and interest) and maximize the time I have to pay it off. I have excellent credit and would like to transfer as much as possible to another BT card, but I'm pretty sure there's a limit to how much you can transfer and I also don't know if I will get approved for a high enough credit line. My affected accounts are with Chase, Amex, and Citibank.

&amp;#x200B;

Is a personal loan my only other option? I have done a balance transfer only once before (0% APR Amex I mentioned above) and am not sure how often you can do it. Can I open multiple BT cards at the same time? My credit score will definitely drop because of the high debt-to-credit ratio I now have, so I likely need to open any new accounts ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for your help, I really appreciate any insights or recommendations!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: She fell for a scam that spoofed a police department number and threatened to arrest her if she didn't comply. She stole my credit cards to buy gift cards that she couldn't afford and verified the charges on my phone (which she also stole) through text/email. I will file a police report but to my knowledge there's practically nothing they can do and I'm not going to fuck up her life over a supremely dumb mistake she made at 20 years old when she was in a state of panic. She is rather clueless sometimes and this is a whole new level of gullibility, but I can definitely weather this storm while she most certainly can't. She may be able to help a little with payments, but I'm not expecting much until she's in a better place financially.

&amp;#x200B;

I've already discussed this with my sister and am not considering legal action at this time. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to handle this as if I were the one scammed and needed to figure out how to consolidate or spread out $60k into smaller payments. Thank you again!",finance
btc,"You know all those, low quality, aggressive, badly spelled ""bcash lol"" type comments... they really could be created by software.","Someone posted [this Gizmodo article](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-backed-ai-company-claims-it-made-a-text-gener-1832650914) ([archive](https://archive.is/UL4eJ)) over on r/monero . It's about using a [Weak-AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AI) to automatically generate sentences that appear to be from humans. The claim is that the OpenAI organisation created and trained such a Weak-AI system. They then fed the Weak-AI the following made up news story as input:

&gt; In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.

The Weak-AI then reportedly, wrote the following all by itself:

&gt; The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid’s Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.
&gt;
&gt; Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.
&gt;
&gt; Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.

This story seems plausible to me considering that NVIDIA have recently managed to create a Weak-AI that can create photo realistic human faces. [Overview video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSLJriaOumA). This is something I consider to be even more difficult to pull off than a machine that can create human-like text sentences.

Now consider the quality of the typical ""bcash lol"" or ""BSV is teh reel bitcoin"" comment that this sub is showered with. It's far lower quality than the quoted paragraph above.

Imagine you are tasked with manipulating a large community which can't be easily penetrated from the upper levels (as seems to have happened to r/bitcoin , Bitcoin Core, bitcointalk bitcoin.org etc etc). A [Sybil Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) is probably one of your best options now. Create division, create in-fighting, create the illusion of popular hatred for your community and project, using lots of cheaply created, fake accounts. Hiring tons of people to do this manually is expensive and makes you vulnerable to having your operation exposed. It would likely be far cheaper and safer to have a small, expert team develop some software that:

* Automatically created large numbers of social media profiles (including twitter, reddit &amp; facebook accounts).
* Make these accounts automatically respond primitively to their programmed areas of interest to create a plausible history for them.
* Guide these accounts to response in a particular, operator-chosen, way in certain communities regarding certain topics.
* With the addition of that NVIDIA software I mentioned, they can now even add a unique, photo-realistic human face to the fake profile.

I know in my gut that the high level financial powers of the world know exactly what crypto currency is and they know the potential threat it is to their extremely lucrative scams (fiat currency, government enforced, crony banks). I know that if these people are willing to rob and scam almost every man, woman and child on the planet, in all cases resulting in reduced prosperity, in many cases resulting in poverty and in some cases even resulting in death, then these groups will almost certainly be comfortable funding operations to damage, delay and co-opt the cryptos that threaten their empires.

In this time of great technological advancement and mass social manipulation, I think it has become more important than ever to learn to think for yourself. There are pearls of wisdom and useful data out there, but to find them you have to learn to sift through a ton of shit. To do this effectively you need to develop discernment skills.

If you have personally concluded that a particular crypto is awesome (whether that be BCH, ETH or even BTC) and you notice large numbers of people telling you you're wrong, consider for a moment that those people might not be wise, might not be truthful and might not even be human. If they make good arguments, offer useful insights or provide verifiable data, then that may be something worth carefully considering. However, if they are just numerous, noisy and nasty, then I think it's quite reasonable to walk on by and confidently continue striding in the direction that **you personally** feel is best.",cryptocurrency

We have the funds to cover the increased payment, so that's not really a concern. It's more are we missing any hidden costs or is this otherwise a bad idea? It seems like it makes sense on the surface - we would consolidate the loans, drop a mortgage, and decrease the interest rate on the $110k principal - but maybe I'm missing something.

personalfinance,Federal return rejected; I think the ‘Qualified Business Income Deduction’ is to blame. Can you help me verify?,"Filed our 2018 taxes a couple weeks ago, and got the notice today the the Fed return was rejected, and that our state return (VA) was also put on hold because of this.

I ran our taxes through HR Block like I do every year. Wife and I (married, filing jointly) each work a full-time job (standard W2), had health coverage the whole year. We own a home/pay a mortgage, but usually qualify just for the standard deduction anyway, due to our real estate taxes being fairly inexpensive. So pretty simple for filing usually.

The difference this year is that my wife had some additional income. She was doing web design for a local company basically as a contractor, and got exactly $6k in payment for her services. She was given a 1099-Misc form for tax use. So when I ran that through the software, they pushed me towards and insisted we would be getting a ‘Qualified Business Income Deduction’ for her side work, which would decrease her taxable income by 20% for 2018. I read up on it briefly it seemed to check out, so I finished up and filed.

And then the return came back as ‘rejected’ today. Was I just wrong to think we were applicable? Does a contractor working from home with a 1099-Misc count? Should I amend the return to drop that 20% deduction? To be clear, she does not have an EIN or any other qualifiers for a small business. Her 1099-Misc form literally only has one box filled out, and that’s for wages earned.

Yes, there is no sign of inflation, but that's about it for tailwinds.

personalfinance,"[26] Transitioning from Medical School to Residency, need advice on what to do with excess student loans from my last semester","Hey PF, I have a somewhat unique problem and I wanted some opinions and perspective. I’m a 4th year medical student starting residency this summer. I took out my student loans for the spring semester and they have gone mostly unused since I’ve been able to live with family rent free this semester. I thought I would need the full amount for our interview season and it wasn’t as expensive as I thought.

I have about 2k sitting in my checking account and 15k sitting in a savings account at 2.1% interest. I will have to cover all my moving expenses in June and I will be going on a vacation after graduation. I will be moving to a LCOL or MCOL area (find out in March) and will make somewhere between 50-60k in salary, so I will be able to comfortably live on my salary. After my 3+ years of residency/fellowship I will make 240k+, which is the normal jump from residency to attending in my desired specialty. Once I am out of residency I will more than likely privately refi to get a lower interest rate.

I have 344k in debt between 5.8-7% interest and will be entering the REPAYE program where the government subsidizes half of all unpaid interest that my monthly payments won’t reach, since most of my loans are unsubsidized. I filed my taxes for this year at 0 income so my payments from July-December will be $0 and my 2020 student loan payments will be a percentage of my gross 2019 earnings (which will be about half of my 50-60k salary) with all of these payments counting towards PSLF if I so choose to utilize this going forward. If I return the student loans sitting in my account within 90 days of getting them, then no interest will accrue on what I returned. I have until March or early April to decide.

My question is: What should I do with that 15k sitting there in my savings account? I figure I’ll need about 5k for moving expenses (first/last month rent, security deposit, furnishing an entire apartment from scratch) and will need 1-1.5k for my vacation. The options as I see them:

1. Return the excess. If someone told me they took out a loan they didn’t need, this is probably what I would tell them if there were no other details. If I did this, then I would be worried that I might run out when moving/getting my residency life in order, since I have to live off this money until mid-July and I have to return the money in March to avoid the interest from accruing on it. Keep in mind, interest is already accruing on my loan balance that doesn’t include this 15k + semester of tuition, so this option keeps interest from accruing only on what I return.

2. Keep all of it out, keep it in my savings account and max out my Roth IRA this year and have enough leftover to fund half of next years (with the half of next years acting as an emergency fund until 2020 hits). This option is attractive because I have no retirement savings at 26 and on average an IRA will beat the 3% interest this loan is at once the interest is subsidized with loan repayments. Once I’m out of residency, I can’t do Roth unless I back door so it’s my understanding that I want to hammer Roth while I’m in a lower tax bracket (60k vs future 250k). Still, I’m investing with borrowed money and IDK when in the calendar year I can contribute since I don’t have any income right now.

3. Put 9k in a vanguard index fund and forget about it.

My gut is telling me to keep the money for moving expenses, max out my roth IRA as soon as I get the opportunity too, and keep the rest as my emergency fund until I can contribute to my 2020 IRA but I wanted outside opinions. Also, if there was a more no brainer option I missed, I’m all ears.",finance

Any advice, context, ideas, or suggestions are welcomed.

Context:

I am a 32 yo male, currently living at home with my parents. I am currently on SSDI and get about $850 a month. This is due to a type of cancer which limits my ability to work due to its side effects. 

I am under doctors orders to minimize risk by limiting exertion, stress and keep my heart rate as low as possible. It has been recommended to me that if I do work, I limit it to 2-4 hours maximum at a time and only in jobs without much exertion or stress. As such, I rarely work, and its usually a cashier job for $14 an hour at a local store. Even if I wanted to work more, finding many jobs in my situation that would also work with my needs seems unlikely. I MAYBE get another $50 a week after taxes for my paycheck if I am lucky. I also occasionally try and sell drawings that I create for spending money online. I do NOT have a bachelors degree as it was interrupted for financial/health reasons, although I still take classes as I can when treatments allow, generously covered/paid for by family/friends.

My cancer is stage IV, for which I get monthly treatment (covered via insurance/Medicaid and federal assistance due to being a research patient) at a cancer research center. This treatment is palliative but not curative and my lifespan will likely be shorter than many. I could live another 5 years, or another 25 years, as it all depends on how my organs hold up, how the treatments continue to go as the years' progress, and what breakthroughs in treatment happen.

So as you can see, I am in a bit of an ""unknown"" situation and its caused me no small amount of frustration.

I don't have much, only about 20k in savings (earning 2% interest) and another couple thousand in a checking account. My expenses are limited. After many years of insurance draining my savings, I am now covered via Medicaid. In total, between car payments and costs, food, transportation, any medical things, and a few ""for fun"" things, I probably spend about $300-400 a month. This is in large part due to living rent-free at this time. I do not have a significant other to spoil (sadly cancer is a red flag in the dating world).

But I am proud to say I am debt free and have, throughout my life, been able to avoid debt. Of course, right now living rent-free is a big help there, as is assistance from family/friends with regards to school tuition.

I guess I am just trying to figure out what I should be doing as it pertains to my life in a financial sense. Obviously, I am severely limited in my income as its primarily SSDI payments. Do folks have job suggestions or ideas of how to make the most of the savings I do have? Am I over-worrying about my savings considering my health situation?  I feel really lost right now and a large part of that is how unknown the future is to me. I feel like I should be planning as if I will live a full life regardless, but it feels nearly impossible with how little cash flow I have and my limitations.

investing,What Causes a Yield Curve to Flatten?,"I am currently learning about bonds and trying to master the understanding of yield curve. My current understanding is that the yield curve plots bonds of many different maturity dates against their respective yield rates (%). A normal yield curve curves upwards with short term bonds with lower yield rates (low risk low return) and long term bonds with higher yield rates (the money is being held longer and hence subjected to more risk and changes in the market, hence high risk high return). I also understand that the FED can control the left side of the yield curve (short term bonds) while the market controls the right side (long term bonds). The curve can flatten if the left side curve moves up or the right side curve moves down. Here are my questions: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. The left side curve moves up if the FED increases interest rates for short term bond. Why does the FED increase interest rates for bonds and what impact does it have on the economy in terms of recession or slowdown? 
2. How do market forces cause the right side of curve to move down and how does that relate to a recession of economy slowdown?
3. When does an inverted yield curve happen?

personalfinance,"Transferring car loan from parents to me, what are my options?","Hi all! To be completely honest I have little experience when dealing with car loans or how best to proceed in my current situation. Let me give some background and what I'm currently looking at.

&amp;#x200B;

Parents agreed to help me buy a car just before I graduated college. They put the loan in their name and secured a 2.49% APR on the loan. Due to that low interest rate I have left the car in their name but I began making the monthly payments as soon as I landed a job. Good for my bank account, not great for my credit history since I have little on there. I'm on their insurance policy and write them a check monthly for my portion. I have quoted the insurance already and have everything in order other than the title transfer and loan situation.

&amp;#x200B;

For sake of building my credit score I think taking over the loan will be beneficial. I know I likely will have to take an increase in the APR for my loan but is there any way I could limit the damage? Is it possible in any way to take over the loan to preserve the APR or is refinancing the only option I have?

I can easily get a loan with \~4.5-5% APR. I believe possibly lower with my credit score of 710+. Should I even be worried about the interest rate or just focused on getting the loan in my name to start building credit diversity/age?

I am in my early **early** 30s and work as a Web Developer in Missouri. The job I have seems to be steady and I don't see it changing any time soon. While I don't have a traditional Emergency Fund I do have a $1,000 (8.9%) line of credit with my local bank that I can dip into if I need to. I don't have a Roth nor does my company match and until recently I've been living pretty much paycheck to paycheck. My FICO is 708. I made an unfortunate investment in a poorly built house. Currently looking for an afterhours job or weekend job for extra income.

\- - -

* What can I do to better my situation and help pay off my debts faster?
* Should I balance transfer Credit Card 2 to another company to take advantage of early, lower interest rates? Am I better off balance transferring else where for lower lifetime interest rates?
* Should I look into debt consolidation?
* Am I better off paying minimum payment + interest payment on all loans (cards,loans,etc) or am I better paying minimum payments and apply any additional income to the highest (or lowest?) loan?
* It's possible I may need to make an attempt to get another loan to take care of foundation issues on the house I live in. Am I better off paying off my 2nd Mortgage before I do this or my highest credit card?
* When should I start worry about paying off all my student loans? It seems like most my monthly payments go toward paying interest.

personalfinance,30 y.o. debating consolidation but having a rough go of it,"EDIT: THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR REPLIES  


Based on every ones replies it seems that consolidating is probably not the right approach to deal with my situation. Much of the advice is lowering my food budget, getting wife to work (not happening any time soon with a newborn), balance transfers, roof patching instead of replacement, freeing up the 622$ from the highest loan, here's what I've decided to do, hope most of you approve:  


1. First I am going to find a couple cards with 0APR balance transfers. Preferably those that also don't have a fee for the transfer but those are rare. I will then transfer the $12.9k of credit card debt to those cards and pay a minimum monthly reallocating most of the financial focus on my 14.3k car loan that is sucking up most of my cash. This will reduce my credit card payments from 350/mo to like 100/mo, giving me 250/mo to spend on what ever the focus is.  

2. I am also going to get a 0 APR card with some type of rewards and get my wife to use it to buy food, lowering our food budget from 1,100/mo to 800/mo for starters. This will free up a total of 1,000/mo to be spent on debt. Only paying the minimum of probably about 100/mo on this card.  

3. Use the majority of my tax refund (2500) on the 14.3k car debt, knocking it down to 11.8k. Then the 250/mo (generated from 0% balance transfers) + 1000/mo (generated from using 0% cc to buy food) + 622/mo (I am currently paying already) + what ever free cash I get from bonuses, birthdays, etc hoping to average to about 2k/mo slap on the car loan, which should pay it off in about 6 months.
4. After the 622/mo is freed up, apply that 2k/mo on the HVAC loan which I should be able to tackle in about 4 months.  

5. Through out this time if budgeted correctly, 10 months the food credit card will have $8000 balance, while $12900 should fall to $11900, basically ending with $20k of 0APR credit card debt (excluding the 1k care credit 0apr card)  

6. Apply +800 -2000 on the cards respectively until the 0 APR special runs out and rinse and repeat onto new cards with similar 0 APR offers until the debt is gone.  

7. Look into patching the roof to buy me 2 years to get to 0 debt and then if I am unable to save up the cash for the roof - finance but focus at the rate described above.
8. I am not cancelling my 401k to funnel that money into debt.  


First I want to say I enjoy following this sub. I am constantly shocked how well most of you do, you have Roth's and most advice posts stem from users that seem financially stable with investments in your 20s! It's incredible, I look like a shipwreck in comparison compared to most of you. I keep quiet generally trying to gain information.

Hopefully spending some time on this post can get me a slither of advice and oversight. When I approach lenders before applying with my life story, I just get a canned response that ends up being something like...  :

&gt;"" We can only make a credit decision once an application has been       submitted and reviewed. "" -- Lightstream.

It completely destroys the communication barrier between the       lender and the client prior to making a life changing decision and       I don't understand this. Its just support reps answering to e-mails, so I can't ever get in touch with a financial advisor. How can I possibly be okay with what ever       offer they are okay at giving, without knowing whether it benefits both of us. So here we go.

I'm in debt, but I also feel like I have a handle on things. I'm confused whether or not I should even pursuit one big loan to       consolidate debt, renovations, emergency preparedness, just       financial preparedness in general, etc.  I am 30y.o., married, have       two kids and an old needy doggo, and am full time employed and       make about $90,000/yr. My credit       score according to Credit Karma is **795-804** for Transunion/Equifax.       My wife does not work... a lot of people frown at this... but in       fact if she tried to gain employment without first taking out       student loans to get a formal college education for a career, without       which - we are talking crappy 24k/yr entry level jobs  - it would cost me more       than her staying at home taking care of the youngest while the oldest start first year of public school (omg no more part time daycare for at least 3 more years), home cooking, and handling a lot of various important day to day life       tasks that is desirable for family success. Many say she should stay home with the kids, but we're bilingual and send our kid to half days daycare to keep that link strong between both languages.

My cost of living isn't that high either, I bring in about  $4,300/month net, and that is after things are deducted for my       401k, full family medical and dental, life insurances and long       term disability. So I am somewhat responsible in terms of financial risk management. My mortgage is $1300/mo, phones/internet $230/mo, car insurance $110/mo,       utilities(hoa/electric/water/waste) about $360/mo, leaves us with       roughly $2300 for other things. First of which is nutrition, we       spend roughly $1100/month on food, to feed a family of 4 and an       old needy doggo that tore an ACL and that is allergic to       everything and needs prescription food, most of the food we eat is       organic and home cooked. We barely go out eating and most of my       single co-workers spend nearly that much by themselves, so I know       we're doing fairly good. Gas money for both of us about $200/mo       and that sums up the cost of living. So our cost of living on my       income is $3300/4300. If I had no debt, this would be a positive   $1k in    cash flow, but alas this is where life comes in. Here's an outline       of my debts.

* GreenSky Loan - Balance remaining: $8704 - APR: 8% (When we bought       our house in 2014, we overpaid an inspector to make sure       everything was checked, and he gave us 3 years on the HVAC       system... which is funny, because the first winter with a 1 y.o.       son, it broke and used coils to heat the house. Power bill came in       at 600$, I had to basically get a new HVAC system, both inside and       outside units, that were apparently 27 years old. ($75/mo)
* Wells Fargo Credit Card - Balance remaining: $1900 - APR: 15+%       (This slowly built up when we exceeded normal spending with car       repairs, registration renewals, doctor visit payments. ($75/mo)
* CareCredit - $1100 - APR 0% (After my 10 y.o. dog tore his ACL,       there were a lot of visits, he also constantly broke out in hives       and had ear infections from over-licking, we still do not know       what he is allergic to, we're thinking 'Soy'... but prescription       diets) Vaccinations, etc. 0 APR though, so I just make the minimum       payments. ($75/mo)
* Bank Of America - $5800 - APR 13%+ (We just had our second child,       and this was used to pay for a lot of medical related things as I       have a high deductible HSA insurance plan) I'm actually expecting       this number to go up by 2600$ which is her remaining out of pocket       maximum remaining. I have included the 2600 in the 5800, as future       debt is real debt) ($130/mo)
* NavyFederal Personal Loan - $14300 - APR 7.69% (We had a car that       was bought out by Ford, we got 20k for it, and then my car broke,       so we ended up needing 2 cars. The check from Ford was enroute,       but we found the cars earlier, so I ended up taking out a 20k loan       thinking we'll just cover it immediately.) Unfortunately, I had a       surgery (-5k), then my oldest son had a surgery (-3k) and then my       wife's mother had colon cancer and needed treatment money (-6k) and we were left with 6k that I just decided to       keep liquid as we often had monthly overage demands due to oldest being in daycare. The good news       is that I made this a 3 year loan, so I have outrageous monthly       payments ($622/mo) on just this loan, but only 23 months left.
* Chase Bank Credit Card - $5200 - APR 12%+ (This is debt carried       over when we bought the house 3 years ago and decided to have new       carpets and flooring, we actually balanced transferred this in for like 20 months of 0apr, but that recently kicked off) It was higher, but we've slowly been       tackling it. ($150/mo)
* Last but not least an impending doom of needing a new roof, that       I'm sure I'll end up having to get a loan for this year - $6000       minimum. We knew this one was coming.

So a summary of my financial position is that out of the       3300/4300, I make $1127 on debt payments without the upcoming roof       loan. (The extra comes from like work bonuses/profitsharing/taxmoneys that I don't consider part of my income) I'm already past the edge here. The only thing that really  offsets us is tax season, where that liquid money is stored and used to cover       overages, taxes on cars, some unexpectables. Next year I'll get two tax  credits for the kids, which will be helpful. As you can see I am       stretched thin and I think due to my 'somewhat fiscal       responsibility' I'm not in super terrible shape, but that light at       the end of the tunnel just keeps getting further and further away       as I see no positive cash flow after debt payments, and don't       really get to enjoy vacations, or date nights. It's pretty wierd being 'broke' to do anything, yet somewhat sustaining in good food, home, location. I'm just loosing my       youth to this debt and its a constant depressant... Granted in 5 years or so when the kids are in both in public school, debts should be mostly paid off, I can focus on paying off the house faster or  finally be able to invest in retirement. The goal of this post is to de-stress me in terms of this lingering consolidation I've been contemplating. So now I'm in this weird position where I have:

$37004 in active debt and an upcoming $6000 from the roof loan.       Puts me at **$43,000 deep.**

My *debt cash-flow* is about 1000/mo, but       that's not changing my situation, so I think I am looking at a       potential maybe 200/mo reduction, to bring it down to a steady       800/mo in debt repayments. I would need 53.75 months to repay that debt **with 0 APR**, but we know that's not happening because the lender needs to make the money too.   So we are looking at me needing a 43,000 loan, most likely a 60 month term. Hello 5 years of acceptable yikes.

But this is where I just get shit on no matter where I look. The APR, all the best loans out there are 24-36 months and       have insanity of conditions just to get that lowest rate. Most of my debt is over 8%, which means getting a loan of equivalent or of higher APR is pointless to me, it doesn't save me money long term which is kind of the goal. Or is it the wrong goal? Is the goal supposed to be just having one place to pay? As I mentioned initially I have a feeling that I have a grip on my debt, I'm not behind, but I just want an easier time, and I'm fine with someone else making the interest off me instead of my current debt owners, as I've put myself in such a predicament. But it has to be reasonable... I obviously have assets and decent income for me to say that the loan would be secure and safe, but why are the offered interest rates so... antagonistic.

An example of something I was looking at is one lender, on nerdwallet they had a little section like:

`Loan amounts $5,000 - $100,000Typical APR Fixed: 6.79% – 16.24% (with autopay)Variable: 6.54% – 14.95% (with autopay)Fees No origination fees, late fees or overdraft feesTime to funding Typically 7 daysRepayments 2 to 7 years`

&amp;#x200B;

But lets be absolutely freaking real - I am not qualifying for 6.79% (Yes I know there's way worse)  I would technically fit right in as the perfect Lendee in terms of safety of repayment with potential lean against a house, cars, etc, but let's be real - those low  fixed rates have an insane amount of conditions that basically disqualify me from the git go. I am not okay with high APR.  This is why I've tried shooting the e-mails to lenders first before I make any sudden moves. But alas all of them want to ding my credit report, give me an offer that I can't even debate or refute. And they have the right to, it's their money, so I see that as a valid point. Sucks for me though. It would be amazing if one of you financial advisors on this sub, or someone contextually more familiar with debt management could take a look at my situation on paper and give me advice, because who knows - maybe consolidating is not the right move for me. Do I consolidate or just ride it out as I am now, hoping that nothing catastrophic happens in this what seems to be a 5-7 year ordeal?",finance
personalfinance,"Assessing job opportunity in Chicago and moving from So Cal, any advice would be greatly appreciated","Hi friendly people of Reddit,

I posted over in the Chicago sub and go zero responses so I figured I would try here.

Our family is debating relocating for a job opportunity at Northwestern downtown. We are a mid 30's couple from California, a 3 year old and a newborn in tote by the time we would move. Not too familiar with the area so figured we could use some advice if we were to relocate.

What areas would you recommend living for a family. We don't mind the suburb type housing but still like to be near fun types of things to do (restaurants, activities, culture type stuff). We live in San Diego currently to give you an idea and we realize it won't be the same in terms of convenience to everything. If we were to move father out, somewhere near the L train to commute in? Good public school district, family friendly, etc.

As far as budget, $100K household income before taxes until SO finds a job. Would rent at first but then look to buy when we figure out the lay of the land. SO job should add at least $75K more but we do not want to take this into consideration and only budget based on the one job secured.

Research so far on neighborhoods is just beginning and hoping you all can help and also assess budget concerns.

* Sales tax (SD=7.75%, Chi=10.75%), state income (SD=8%, Chi=4.95%), federal (22%)
* Tax wise looks to be a wash, maybe a smidgen better
* We are spending $1,000 on childcare currently for one which looks to be around the same based on preliminary search. Would need to budget for potentially two children now.
* Current household income is $150K
* Current mortgage is $2100, bills always paid in full, no student debt, fully fund both retirement accounts (we are late to save but plan on trying to max these out from here on out), Roths funded, and have emergency fund built
* Will likely need to buy one car when we move out, $30K is our max budgeted

I can be more detailed if needed but I think this give a good snapshot.

personalfinance,Single or Married filing?,"Hi, this is a question, is common Law in Canada recognized by the IRS? In all provinces it seems Common Law and married are two different things, and just because you are common law doesn't mean you are married in Canada afaik.

For the purposes of the IRS, I would assume I am filing ""Single"" if common law in Canada since it doesn't seem ""denominated"" as marriage. 

I know Common Law Marriage in the US in some states is a lawful marriage. From many things I have read it seems just because you are in a marriage like relationship (common law) and have the same benifets, that it is not a legal marriage in Canada.

Here is one thing from the IRS
 "" However, individuals who have entered into a registered domestic partnership, civil union, or other similar relationship that isn’t called a marriage under state (or foreign) law aren’t married for federal tax purposes.""

And another
""Foreign marriages. Two individuals who enter into a relationship denominated as marriage under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction are recognized as married for federal tax purposes if the relationship would be recognized as marriage under the laws of at least one state, possession, or territory of the United States, regardless of domicile.""",finance

Our take home income is about $9,500 per month, expenses are somewhat below that, but not terribly below that (don't yell, I'm doing a detailed budget for February - and every month going forward - to start figuring out exactly where our money goes).

worldpolitics,Banking Mafia,"​The Medici family are a well known Black Nobility involved in the Vatican, banking, medical industry, secret societies, and Zionism. They are leaders in the global banking mafia. Many of the Florentine noble families are ancestors of Assyro-Chaldeans that practiced witchcraft and alchemy and then migrated into Florence during ancient Rome. During the Moorish invasion more of these clans migrated into Florence and brought large amounts of gold with them. Napoleon Bonaparte was the first political Zionist who proclaimed for all ""Jews"" to settle in Jerusalem. Zionism is really about domination. Zion is a hill in Jerusalem which is considered a holy land by Christians, Jews, and Muslims. Zion refers to a military triumph. The Medici family were one of the wealthiest banking families in Europe for centuries. They produced 3 Popes and 2 Queens of France. The Medici and Bonaparte families are closely related and are still working together. Both of these families still exist today. Emilio Garrastazu Medici was a Brazilian dictator that established the military government in Brazil. The Brazilian Andre Cezar Medici works at the World Bank as a health economist in Washington DC today. The name Medici means medical and they have been linked with practicing sorcery. Pharmacy derives from the Greek word Pharmakeia which means sorcery and poison. The most common symbol used in medicine is the Rod of Asclepius which is of a serpent coiled around a rod similar to the Staff of Hermes. The Medici family are involved in alchemical witchcraft and run the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.  Chic Cicero is an agent of the Medicis and he founded an American temple of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Medicis have a statue of Hermes at their palace in Rome. The Medici family founded the Botanical Garden of Pisa which is the oldest botanical garden in Europe and also established the Botanical Garden of Florence. They use herbs and plants for alchemy which is about the manipulation of the human psyche and physiology. They use members of their Hermetic Order to infiltrate food and drug companies. The French Hermes-Dumas family are agents of the Medicis and own Hermes a luxury fashion company headed up by Axel Dumas. The Hermes-Dumas family are worth about 30 billion. Patrick Guerrand-Hermes is another member of this family and worth about 1 billion. The Medici family of Ottajano own the Chaldean Mafia headed up by Louis Akrawi of Detroit. The Chaldean Mafia are Iraqi Catholics and known for trafficking ecstasy and operate in Israel. The Israeli Mafia are the primary manufacturers of ecstasy in the world. Ecstasy is a dangerous synthetic chemical drug used for mind control and is a form of alchemy.

The use of chemicals to manipulate the body and mind is what alchemy really is. The Merieux are a French family that own Institut Merieux which develops vaccines and studies diseases. What they really do is engineer diseases and add them into vaccines that are ""intended"" to prevent the diseases they create. Many vaccines admit to using live viruses. The Merieux family are agents of the House of Medici with Alain Merieux as the head and worth over 3 billion. There is a Medici Firma international investment firm with offices in the United States, Switzerland, and Australia. Medici Firma is a financial mafia that works as a shadow partner with banks like HSBC, Liechtenstein Global Trust, HNA Group, Softbank, and BlackRock. Medici Firma has a financial intelligence division used for gathering information on economies, governments, banks, and markets. Medici Firma has been secretly buying up land in the United States through their real estate division. Medici Firma is probably the most secretive investment firm on the planet and has removed information regarding its investments and business contracts since it was originally exposed. On their Medici Firma Council page on their website they have a Masonic square and compass. There is another company called Medici Ventures which is a subsidiary of Overstock. Medici Ventures manages companies involved in online bank transfers, online security programs, and other types of online financial systems. Medici Firma and Medici Ventures are secretly controlled by the House of Medici. The Gucci family were recent billionaires with Aldo Gucci who was born in Florence, Tuscany. Gucci is still headquartered in Florence today and is headed up by the CEO Marco Bizzarri and Alessandro Michele. Gucci is now a subsidiary of Kering owned by the French billionaire Francois Pinault who is an agent of the Medici family. Francois Pinault and his family including his son Francois-Henri Pinault are worth about 30 billion. The French Pinault family owns the holding company Groupe Artemis which owns Kering and the auction house Christies with Patricia Barbizet as the CEO. Political Zionism had origins in France. The Medicis are secretly connected with many Jewish Zionists and were the owners of the Italian-Jewish East Harlem Purple Gang which worked with the Savoy owned Genovese crime family. The East Harlem Purple Gang absorbed into the Genoveses which today manage the Harlem based rap group and organized crime syndicate called the Diplomats or Dipset with members Cam'Ron, Jim Jones, Juelz Santana, and Hell Rell. Members of Dipset often wear purple and pink. The Medicis and Savoys have intermarried. The Medicis also owned the older Jewish Purple Gang in Detroit. The old Jewish Mafia was always mixed in with Italians. Both the Jewish Mafia and Medicis have been partly kicked out of black hand organized crime for trying to take over. The Medicis are still infiltrated in various mafias and use Zionist bankers like the Dreyfus family to tax them through money laundering operations. The private bank Dreyfus Sons &amp; Co in Switzerland paid a fine of 24 million for enabling tax evasion with their hundreds of hidden US connected accounts amounting to $1.76 billion.
​
The Dreyfus family have similar ancestry as the Medici family and they are extremely wealthy. The Medici, Dreyfus, and Sassoon families are all descendants of Babylonian-Chaldeans. Baron James Sassoon covertly works with the Medicis and is the current Commercial Secretary to Treasury in the United Kingdom. It was during the Sasanian Empire when the Chaldean Catholic Church was established. The French Dreyfus branch work as Court Factors for the House of Bonaparte which work with the Medicis. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a very high level murderous satanic witch and she is overseen by Prince Giuliano de Medici. Pierre Dreyfus is Vice Chairman of the Swiss bank Dreyfus &amp; Sons. Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte was the first President of France. French presidents are the heads of the Bonaparte's Legion of Honour which has many members that are billionaires and heads of major corporations and banks like Alfred Dreyfus, Pierre Louis-Dreyfus, Benoit Potier, Pierre-Andre de Chalendar, Patrick Pouyanne, Rene Obermann and Bernard Arnault who is worth tens of billions. Cosimo III de' Medici the last Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany bankrupted the state bank right after receiving large deposits of gold from the Elector of Bavaria. I believe the Medici family used this gold to finance the Jewish Rothschild family as the new top bankers as an attempt to deflect away from Christian royals and nobles and especially north Italian bankers like the Medicis. The Rothschild family have worked with the House of Medici with Carl Mayer von Rothschild who ran the Naples Bank financing the House of Medici and working with Prince Luigi de Medici of Ottajano. The Medici family developed the Double-Entry book keeping system used for tracking debts. Current members of these crime families include Prince Ottaviano de Medici, Prince Giuliano de Medici, Prince Lorenzo de Medici-Tornaquinci-Foscari and of the House of Bonaparte there is Prince Charles Napoleon Bonaparte, and Prince Jean Christophe Napoleon Bonaparte. Prince Jean Christophe worked for Morgan Stanley and Advent International which is a major buy out firm with assets estimated at over 30 billion. There is another Prince Lorenzo de Medici in Italy as well. Princess Elisabetta de Medici works with a ruthless and diseased child murdering rapist witch named Elizabeth Martello. The Medici family are Rome's tax collectors and they oversee the IRS through Rome's network of power. David Kautter was Jesuit educated from Georgetown Law and is Commissioner of the IRS. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shares a similar architectural design with the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi in Florence. The Medici family command their agents in the IRS to financially persecute people that Rome has declared as heretics. Not only is income tax immoral but the IRS make up debts out of thin air and they persecute people based on these made up or inflated debts. Prince Ottaviano de Medici is the head of this evil bloodline and a ruthless tyrant.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans?,"Hello fine people of personal finance!

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished my last semester at a public uni in New Jersey last semester and have been left with those dreaded student loans. I have  $17,401.14 in unsubsidized  loans (interest rates 3.75% to 4.5%) and $3,305 in subsidized loans for a grand total of $20,706.14. I know this is not as much as the average student will have to pay off post graduation, but it is still a scary number.

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $10k in my savings and my parents had saved about an extra $12k to $13k for my education, so I am in a position to pay it all off, but I would be left with essentially nothing. I plan on going to graduate school in the fall to work towards a PhD. Luckily my tuition will be waived and I would be making some money off of a teacher assistantship (roughly $24k a year).  

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from that, I will be attempting a thru hike of the Appalachian Trail with a friend this upcoming spring. We are going to see how far we can go in the time we have. Obviously during this time I will not be earning any sort of income and will have to pay for certain expenses along the trail.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do you think I should do? Should I pay off my loans and have essentially no savings, or should I space out my payments over the years to come? Any advice is greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Recently graduated from grad school and trying to aggressively pay off student loans but unsure on how to distribute my current income.,"Hey Reddit,

I’ve been lurking on this subreddit over the past few months to get a better idea of how to balance of how to build out my budget for the next couple of years to finally tackle my student loans. I’m currently 25 YO Male living in a midwestern city. I currently have about 30k of student loans at variable interest rates, two being above 5% which at 4,300 at 6.8% and 2,000 at 5%. My father also has about $80k in loans under his name only that I’d like to assist with paying down the minimums once I’m finished with my current loans. My grace period for repayment ends in April so interest has started to increase on all my loans. Also my MBA was fully paid my employer so these student loans are solely from my undergrad.

I’ve been employed for about two and half years full time but due to a few unforeseen medical expenses and international travel I really didn’t pay down much of the interest while I was in grad school. Since January 2019, I’ve shifted my focus to aggressively pay down my student loans so I can be done with them in the next two years. 

Here is my current budget:

I currently have about $4500 in savings from about $1500 in stocks that tripled in value over the three years, $1250 in a HYS at 2.2%, and the remainder in my standard checking account. My take home is about $2300 a month. Since my fulltime employment, my employer contributes at 8.5% and I’ve contributed 8.5% with about 20K in my 401k. 

Due to my recent promotion, I’m currently contributing 11.5% which seems a bit high and I’m debating reducing it to my minimum 5% and using the extra income to pay down my loans. I pay my credit card debt in full every month and those expenses are included in my budget.

Monthly Budget:

$500 – Rent

$60 – Synchrony Phone Credit ($602 interest free till 11/20, minimum is $35)  

$50 – Gas (Walk to work so this could be less)

$200 – Groceries

$75 – Restaurant/Coffee/Bars

$35 – Electricity (Usually about $20-$30 in the non-summer months)

$1000 – Student Loans (Edit: Expected rate is about $380 a month)

$350 - Savings

Yearly Expenses:

$750 - Car Insurance ($350ish payments in January and September)

$500 – Travel

$250 - AMEX Renewal


Questions:

* Should I spend more of my savings to paydown my loans as soon as possible? 

* To get it off my chest, should I do a lump payment on the phone payment and use all future payments towards my student loans?

* Should I bring down my contribution for my retirement? My minimum contribution would need to be 5% which is about $115 more I could use towards my loans on a monthly basis.

* I’d like to build up an emergency fund to $6K but should that be a goal for later until my student loans are out of the way?

* Since AMEX increased their yearly renewal fee would my credit score take a huge hit if I canceled the account in 2020? This account has been open since summer 2016. I've reaped the benefits but the cost/reward is almost $0 now. My average credit age is 4.5 years.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: I appreciate all the advice that you contributed.------------------------------------------------

* I'll continue to pay my $60 a month on the phone payment to get it out of the way by the end of 2019 instead of paying all of the balance down since there is no interest until 11/2020.

* I'm going to reduce my contribution to 5% so my employer will continue to pay at 8.5% and utilize my surplus 6.5% towards my monthly loan payments.

* Going to stick around a 4k EM fund for the for a rainy day and then push the money that I was putting towards savings into loans.

* I'll negotiate with AMEX before my renewal this year to switch to a lower rewards card w/o a renewal fee.

* Also looking around for a higher paying job which is more appropriate for my current education/experience.",finance
personalfinance,Major Student Loan Anxiety,"I know this isn’t as much as a lot of people, but I have over $40k in student loan debt and it feels completely overwhelming.  My interest rate is 5.15%, which I think is pretty good based on what my friends are paying.  I just HATE (and I really mean hate) paying that interest every month.  Here’s where I could use some help from people who have been here before….

I just got a raise (yay!) and now I have about an extra $750 every month to put towards my loans.  The problem is I’m getting conflicting opinions about whether that’s the right thing to do with that extra money.  I’ve watched some Dave Ramsey videos and I know he would say to put it towards my loans, but some people at work said that it would be better off for me to put it in savings since I don’t have a big safety net yet.

stocks,"Stock Market Week Ahead for the trading week beginning February 18th, 2019","Hey what's up r/stocks! Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely last week in the market, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 18th, 2019.

# **What to watch in the market in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/15/fed-could-be-back-in-play-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The Fed calmed the markets in late January when it said it could stop raising interest rates, but investors are watching the release of its meeting minutes for any sign the Fed could veer off its easy path.
*****
&gt; ""It's hard to imagine the Fed sounding as dovish in the minutes, as [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell sounded in the briefing . We do think the minutes will be bearish. As far as the general tenor, it's hard to see it more dovish than it was on Jan. 30,"" said Michael Schumacher, director strategy at Wells Fargo.
*****
&gt; The Fed, at that meeting, held rates steady and emphasized it could pause in its rate hiking cycle. In what felt like an about face from its December meeting, Powell also emphasized that the Fed would be flexible with its balance sheet. The Fed releases the minutes of its meeting Wednesday afternoon.
*****
&gt; Positive comments on trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials, and a commitment to continue talks in the coming week helped boost stocks Friday and could continue to support the market in the week ahead. Investors were also watching for more information on a Commerce Department report, which could be viewed as a market negative if it recommended tariffs on European automobiles. The president has 90 days from this weekend to act on the report.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, even with Thursday's sell off on stunningly weak December retail sales data. The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.5 percent to 2,775, and the Dow was at 25,883, up 3 percent for the week.
*****
&gt; After December retail sales slumped 1.7 percent, Walmart earnings on Tuesday will be even more important. The retail sales data was contrary to other reports from retailers and others that showed solid holiday sales, so Walmart's comments about what it is seeing now as well as during the end of the fourth quarter will be important.
*****
&gt; ""We're going to watch them very closely, and that's because of the retail sales number. The government shutdown, plus the market going down, everyone talking about a recession coming. Did people cut back spending a little bit? Was it real?"" said Vinay Pande, head of trading strategies at UBS Global Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; Walmart's comparable store sales in the fourth quarter were expected to be up about 3 percent, and its earnings per share are expected to be flat at $1.33, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Economists cut their expectations for fourth quarter growth to under 2.5 percent after the retail sales number, which was viewed as suspect by some. Goldman Sachs economists called the report an outlier, and said that as much of 1 percentage point of the drop is unexplained.
*****
&gt; ""Some special factors likely contributed to the fall in core retail sales, including an early Thanksgiving, the December stock-market sell-off, and the start of the government shutdown,"" it said.
*****
&gt; So the coming week's data will also be important, including weekly jobless claims Thursday, which were higher for a third week this past week. The concern is that rising claims could be an early warning sign of a slowdown in the labor market.
*****
&gt; ""Unemployment claims are rising, at the same time employment growth and income growth are not suggesting this is the case,"" said Pande.
*****
&gt; Data on home builder sentiment comes out Tuesday morning, and existing home sales and unemployment claims Thursday.
*****
&gt; Pande said the market broke out in the past week from a sideways trade it fell into earlier in the month. ""Until last week, we just went back to the status quo of November,"" he said, adding the sell off in December was way overdone. The market has been at an impasse between the lift from value, and the drag from what he called the idiosyncratic risks, like trade, the shutdown threat and other geopolitical risk.
*****
&gt; ""I think the balance shifted a bit. The bad news on the idiosyncratic front is being overwhelmed by the less bad,"" Pande said.
*****
&gt; Pande said there's a risk that investors will read the Fed's minutes in the coming week a little more hawkish than it intends.
*****
&gt; There could be discussion in the minutes about the balance sheet unwind, which some traders fear has been making markets less liquid.
*****
&gt; At the Jan. 30 meeting and before, Powell had backtracked on a comment he made after the December meeting that the unwind was on ""autopilot.""
*****
&gt; ""It's not a gigantic concession to say I'm flexible. This QT was going to end at any rate at the end of the year,"" said Pande, adding ""we could misinterpret the minutes.""
*****
&gt; Schumacher said the bond market will be looking for details on which securities the Fed might be rolling off of its balance sheet and which it will be replacing with new purchases, as their holdings mature.
*****
&gt; ""We think potentially the biggest move in the bond market as far as the minutes go is the composition of the balance sheet. It's not so much the equilibrium number, or when the Fed gets there...There's been talk that the Fed should shorten the duration of its Treasurys. That should mean a steeper curve and higher long term yields,"" Schumacher said. If the Fed does signal it wants to hold shorter-duration securities, yields on the 10-year and 30-year bond could rise.

# Day After Presidents’ Day: Improving, But Record Still Bearish

&gt; Yesterday we pointed out the day before Presidents’ Day was amongst the poorest performing holiday over the long run. The day after is even weaker over the long run. However since 2012, the market’s performance after the long holiday weekend has improved, most notably during the last seven years with S&amp;P 500 positive in six of these years.

# Should Investors Love A Great Start to 2019?

&gt; Happy Valentine’s Day everyone! With the S&amp;P 500 Index up 9.8% for the year as of yesterday, this is its best start up to this point since 1991. So should investors love to see this much green this early in the year, or should they be leery they might be heartbroken down the road?

&gt; An old adage on Wall Street suggests, “As goes January, so goes the year.” With stocks having posted their best January in more than 30 years, it’s time to take a closer look at the January barometer, first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac. Simply put, if the first month of the year is green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa).

&gt; Let’s get one thing straight—this didn’t work last year. The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 5% in January of 2018, and it closed the year in the red. Nonetheless, the January barometer has a strong track record, and one we shouldn’t ignore.

&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the rest of the year (final 11 months) has been up 11.7% on average, well above the overall average return of 7.6% for the final 11 months of the year. However, when that first month was red, the final 11 months were up only 1.2% on average. According to LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, “The January barometer isn’t perfect, but it does have a pretty solid track record. Now where things really get interesting is when that first month was up more than 7% (like in 2019), the return over the final 11 months actually became stronger.” 

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/the-january-barometer-has-bulls-smiling.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Of course, we don’t suggest investing based simply on what the first month does, but with a more accommodative Federal Reserve, fiscal policy still flowing, and likely continued better-than-expected corporate earnings growth, this is yet another sign that 2019 may see a continuation of the bull market, as we outlined previously in our Outlook 2019.

&gt; In all the instances when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7% at the end of January, the rest of the year gained five out of six times, with only 1987 negative. Still, a 10.3% return over the final 11 months implies we’d see new highs before 2019 is over. Last, be open to a pullback, as a median correction of 8.1% has happened in the past after super strong starts to the year.

# The Year of the Pig Could Have Bulls Smiling

&gt; “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

&gt; The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) kicked off Tuesday, February 5, and with it came the Year of the Pig. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs—it is important to note that the Year of the Pig has historically been quite strong for equities.

&gt; Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&amp;P 500 Index starting in late January dating all the way back to 1928.* And wouldn’t you know it? The Year of the Pig is up nearly 15% on average. Oink oink indeed!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Year-of-the-Pig-Returns-are-quite-strong.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The year of the pig is the twelfth of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the pig is considered a symbol of wealth in Chinese culture, which is quite interesting given some strong equity returns have taken place during this year. In fact, out of the 12 zodiac signs, no year sports a better average return,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Year-of-the-Pig-Could-have-Bulls-Happy-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Be aware that a small sample size and the pure randomness of this makes us want to stress not to ever invest purely based on the zodiac signs. Still, here’s to the year of the pig playing out for the bulls once again!

personalfinance,"Moving out of home, have loans, trying to make good decisions. Help!","Hi all,

23 (F) here. I'm a NYer living in Brooklyn. Recently, I won the nyc housing lottery-- $700/m for 1 bedroom, which is truly a steal. I wanted to reach out for financial advice regarding my current situation, how to finance my move into this apartment (and furniture) and where I should put my money.

Pay: $20/hr x 35, no paid days off so this really fluctuates given the NYC office closed days.

Debt: $13K in Federal Student Loans (down from $32K in May 2017-- yes, I tried really hard to get my loans down), interest rate averages at 3.75, so not too high.

I have $2700 in my checking, which will be gone soon due to Security on this apartment, first months rent and other moving related expenses.

I have 4,513 in savings-- my security fund-- it accrues 2.02 interest monthly. This is VERY important to me because my father is sick but doesn't have much money, and in case things ever take a turn I want money to be able to pause my job and stay with him for a few months.

I have $3,460 in a Vanguard ETF. Thinking of making this a 401K, i did this on a whim a few months ago, and I'm unsure about it.

After months of paying down my loan, I wanted to pause my efforts just to allow myself to build some savings while living at home and allow myself greater security. However, now I'm doubting this decision. I'm also nervous about financing this apartment (I move in in two weeks) but given the NYC real estate and rental market, this apartment was an opportunity I couldn't turn down. Any and all advice is welcome.

Thanks",finance
personalfinance,Advice on car budget and possibly getting a car loan,"Hello all, 

Just yesterday my cars transmission died so in search of a new car. My old car was a 1997 Toyota corolla so now hesitant on buying older cars since I constantly had to due maintenance on it. So thinking of a newer but still older car but with that said that will lead me to an auto loan. 

I work full time, but commute 140 miles roundtrip to work. I really wish I could save money and just take public transit but where I live it's not the best option at 5 hrs. 

Sorry not trying to go on a rant but if I had to get an auto loan, what are the best steps in getting a decent interest rate. I'm not looking to get a fancy car at all just a reliable one for my commute.

So I’m 21 and going to be starting out as an auditor for one of the Big 4. I’m still in college but am rolling off an internship. I’ll be making starting salary of mid 50s (you know how it is). About 1 year from now I’ll start my full time. I have about 25k in fed loan debt which is very manageable.  

I’m wanting to start a personal ROTH IRA as soon I am finished with this internship and aggressively invest. I know that the limit is like 6k per year? I’ve been looking into vanguard, fidelity, etc but I’m pretty lost right now on all the different indexes/options and would appreciate any guidance on them! 

I know a lot people will say pay the debt off ASAP but I’m pretty confident I want to get time in the market early.

personalfinance,Financial Growth Advice for 22 year Old,"Hello everyone,

I’m a 22 year old college student hoping to graduate in fall with a degree in Economics. I currently do not have any student loans and at the moment the only debt I have is a car loan (2.75% APR, $350 in payment and $21000 left on the car over 6ish years). I have about $11,000 in savings, with $10,000 in an employer 401K (80% in T-Rowe blue chip fund, the rest in employer stock), and $11000 in an employer stock ownership plan. I currently put 15% of what I make in 401k and my employer’s stock.

I am looking for advice on how best to grow my savings so that I would be able to retire in my 50s comfortably. I current make around $50k a year at my current job hoping to move farther up in the company (potentially to $115K a year within 5 years).

I would like to put my savings to good use and I know I could use it to pay off a large portion of my car loan but with the low interest rate, I have more value in my money today than it will be in the future. I would also like to buy a house within 5 years when the housing market offers a better value on homes, so I still want to have some savings in case the opportunity arises.

I’m looking for any tips or strategies in different investment avenues that have been successful for any of you. Contemplating investing in stocks (mainly SCI) and waiting for a market crash to invest in blue chip stocks like Disney, Home Depot, etc.

personalfinance,New York Charitable Gifts Trust Fund,"I'm looking into if it makes sense for me to donate to the NY Charitable Gifts Trust Fund for the 2019 tax year to save money on my 2019 taxes.  


My understanding of how this works is that I will receive an 85% tax credit for New York State and my federal AGI will be decreased by the amount of the donation (but I will no longer be able to take the standard deduction because I'm itemizing).  


My specific situation is that I expect to owe $42,446 in state and city taxes this year ($26653 nys and $15793 nyc). I don't have many things I can itemize so I want to aim to pay $10,000 in state and city taxes at the end of the year. This means that I need to contribute enough to the charitable trust to get a credit of $32,446. Because the credit is only worth 85% of the total donation, that means I need to donate $38,171. Now when I itemize my deductions I will be able to deduct $48,171 from my federal AGI ($10,000 nys taxes and $38,171 charitable contributions). Taking into account that the standard deduction is $12,200, I'm only decreasing my federal AGI by $35,971 compared to if I didn't contribute to the trust. At a 35% marginal rate, this means my federal taxes will decrease by $12,589.  


So in total, I save $32,446 (nys tax credit) + $12,589 (federal tax deduction) = $45,035 for donating $38,171 resulting in a total tax savings of **$6864.**  


I have a couple questions about the assumptions I have made here though, specifically:

* Since I'm getting a ny tax credit for the charitable donations, I assume I'm not also going to get a ny tax deduction here? That is to say, making this charitable donation doesn't also decrease my state / city AGI?  (this would increase my savings)
* Do I  lose the nys standard deduction by taking this tax credit? (this would decrease my savings)
* Can I use this tax credit against both state and city taxes? I pay over $10,000 in city taxes and so this would mean that I can only get a credit equal to the full amount of my nys taxes. (this would decrease my savings)",finance

solar,10.1kW Texas Grid Tied PV System Newbie Questions,"I tried to be pretty aggressive and do my homework. Texas is notorious from what I've read in having a poor payback period and no good credits which have made it not something I've moved forward on. I moved about 2 years ago into a house with 2016 roof, 2 story, no trees, and thought it just looked like a solar dream (0 Shade, good tilt, etc.) from google Earth. I didn't pounce though because with the low cost of energy here (usually 7-9c per kWh) and no rebates I didn't feel it was financially viable.

&amp;#x200B;

Well Oncor my actually energy provider had a program this year up to 25% on 1-15kW home systems to help with some problems last year in handling peak energy in the Summer, project agreement is contingent on their approval of this rebate as funds are limited. This paired with the last year of the 30% Federal caused me to get interested. I got a lot of quotes and researched companies for good referrals, prices, product, and that were not salesmen, but interested in proliferating solar. I think I found that quote, and just want to make sure I'm making the right call on installer, product, and most importantly not missing a gotcha that is going to make it a huge hassle or cost I didn't think of.

personalfinance,Help! Should we buy this house?,"My wife and I currently live in a home that we bought 3.5 year ago for $347k with a 3.75% interest rate. We have outgrown the home and would need to do about $40k in renovations (additional bedroom and bathroom in basement, fence for yard because of little ones) in order to stay in the home longer term. 

However, we recently came across a home that checks almost every box for us and would be a long term home- maybe even a “forever” home. Great public schools, awesome neighborhood, perfect layout for family and guests, big yard. The house definitely  could use some updates over time but nothing we need to do right away- very easy to move right in. The neighborhood is very up and coming and seems to hold its value well. 

The issue is we are going about 40-50K over our budget. Our monthly budget will be a little stressful for a while, but our jobs (dentist and tech sales) are steady and our incomes are increasing as we get more experience. In order to get 20% down and not pay PMI, we will need to take around 20K from our Roth IRA (without penalty). The other issue is the best loan interest rate we can get right now is 4.35%. We’ve heard this number will only be going up. To us, it seems more prudent to take this risk now while interest rates are still close to what we got 3 years ago, and buy this house that we could stay in for 30 years. It feels like a good risk. It also seems most wise to take money out of our savings to put the 20% down as opposed to paying PMI and getting a higher interest rate. 

Are we thinking right here or do we suck it up and stay in our starter home, &amp; save more money? We’ve been looking &amp; this really is the best deal we’ve seen that would make  us want to move from our current home.",finance

personalfinance,Seeking Information On Student Loan Discharges and IL State Taxes (US),"**TLDR**     
Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, I do not need to claim federal student loans that were discharged on the basis of disability as income on my federal tax returns. However, I am struggling to find information on whether or not I must claim the discharge as income on my Illinois state tax return. If anyone knows the answer or could point me towards resources I could read through, I’d really appreciate it! 

**Full Spiel**       
I was approved for a federal student loans discharge on the basis of total and permanent disability (TPD) in 2015, and I completed the 3 year monitoring period in 2018. During the 3 year monitoring period, if you personally earn above a certain amount, you are unapproved for the discharge. In 2018 I received a letter stating I had successfully completed the monitoring period.

Previously, my husband and I would have had to claim the discharged loan as income on our taxes upon the completion of the monitoring period. However under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, people who received loan discharges on the basis of TPD after January 1, 2018 do not have to claim the loans as income on their tax return. 

[Here is an article with more information on TPD loan discharges and federal taxes](https://www.credible.com/news/student-loans/disabled-no-longer-face-big-tax-hit-student-loans-forgiven/amp/)

Since my monitoring period ended in 2018, the loan servicer (Nelnet) said their understanding is I do not need to claim the discharge on my taxes, and as such, I was not issued a form 1099C. I feel incredibly lucky because, like most people, our income being artificially elevated on our tax return would have been a major financial hit. 

We were about to file our taxes when I came across [this article](https://blog.credit.com/2018/10/government-policies-impact-student-loans-187599/) and read the following quote: 

&gt; “Keep in mind that your state may still consider loan forgiveness granted through a TPD discharge to be taxable income. The Department of Education suggests checking with your state tax office or a tax professional before you file your state tax return.”

I have searched for an hour and a half, and I cannot find information on whether a TPD loan discharge needs to be claimed as income in Illinois. Thanks for reading and for any help you might be able to provide!",finance
worldpolitics,Goldman Sachs,"Goldman Sachs is being overseen by the Doria and Sacchetti banking families of Italy. Their combined names translated from Italian mean Gold Sachs. The Doria name derives from de Auria and Aureo or D'oro which are Italian words for gold. The Doria family started out as a banking family from Genoa. Marquis Marco Doria the Count of Montaldeo is a top member of the Doria family today and he was Mayor of Genoa from 2012 to 2017. The Sacchetti and Sachs name both mean bags or sacks. Italian nobility usually have the highest authority in society through Rome's network of power. Marquis Marcello Sacchetti was a merchant banker that was the treasurer of the Apostolic Chamber for the Vatican. The Doria family ruled in the Genoa Republic which was a major banking empire with its Bank of Saint George founded by the Grimaldis which are married with the Dorias with Doge Giovanni Doria of Genoa who was the son of Agostino Doria and Soprana Grimaldi. There are numerous Jesuit educated top executives working for Goldman Sachs as well as Vatican knights. Peter Oppenheimer is on the board of directors for Goldman Sachs and was Jesuit educated from Santa Clara University. Lakshmi Mittal is another member of Goldman Sachs board of directors and he was Jesuit educated from St. Xavier's College of Kolkata, India. Mark Carney is the Governor of the Bank of England and worked for Goldman Sachs for 13 years. Mark Carney was Jesuit educated at St. Francis Xavier High School. Edward Gerald Corrigan was a former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was Jesuit educated from Fordham University, and is currently managing director in the Office of the Chairman at Goldman Sachs and is Chairman for Goldman Sachs USA. Debora Spar was on the Board of Directors for Goldman Sachs and she went to Georgetown. Robert Agostinelli is an Italian-American billionaire and banker that worked as a senior partner for Goldman Sachs and later founded Rhone Group. Agostinelli was educated at the Roman Catholic St. John Fisher College and he is a top member of the Friends of Israel Initiative and also worked for Jacob Rothschild. Princess Marina of Savoy is from the Doria family branch called the Maria Ricolfi-Doria family and she married Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV of Savoy the current head of the Italian royal family. The Savoys live in Switzerland where banking is private. The name Savoy refers to savings. They accumulate wealth and save it in private Swiss accounts.   

The Roman born Mario Draghi who is President of the European Central bank, board member for the Bank for International Settlements, and member of the G30, was Jesuit educated from the Massimiliano Massimo Institute in Rome. Mario Draghi previously worked as vice chairman and managing director of Goldman Sachs International. Peter Sutherland was a Vatican Knight of the Order of St. Gregory, Jesuit educated from Gonzaga College, Bilderberg member, former Director for the Royal Bank of Scotland, and Director of the GAAT and he worked as non-executive Chairman of Goldman Sachs International. Geoffrey Boisi is a Roman Knight of Malta, Jesuit educated from Boston College, member of the Trilateral Commission, Trustee for the Papal Foundation, and worked as a top executive for Goldman Sachs for decades as well as JP Morgan and Freddie Mac. Eileen Rominger was Jesuit educated from Fairfield University, Director of Investment Management at the United States Security and Exchange Commission, and she was the Global Chief Investment Officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The head of the Sacchetti family today is Prince Urbano Sacchetti of Rome along with Marquis Marcello Sacchetti, and Marchesa Giovanna Sacchetti. The head of the Doria family is Prince Jonathan Doria Pamphilj and Princess Gesine Doria Pamphilij who were adopted into the family so they work under Marquis Marco Doria and Princess Marina of Savoy. Prince Jonathan Doria-Pamphilj is also a major pedophile that molests little boys. Another official member of this family is the wealthy businessman and politician Joao Doria the current Governor of Sao Paulo in Brazil. The Doria family also married with the Landi family with the Landi di Chiavenna family with Giovanni Landi Di Chiavenna and his sons Ludovico and Manfredi. Antonio Zanardi Landi is an Italian ambassador to the Holy See and Order of Malta and his wife is Sabina Cornaggia Medici Castiglioni of the Medici banking family. Landi refers to land. Gold and silver are mined from land owned by rulers like princes and monarchs. Landowners are above bankers and employ them.

personalfinance,Looking for input on a career change at 28 and the financial repercussions of obtaining more student debt.,"I hope that I am posting to the correct subreddit, if not please feel free to redirect me to one that best suits my post. 


I am a 28 year old female who is planning on going back to school to obtain an associates degree. I think it will help me earn more and give me better job security in the long run. My goal is to be able to support myself comfortably.  I will try to give as many details as possible regarding where I am at financially.


I have worked a full time job since I graduated high school. I did attend college in my early twenties and have around 12 credit hours in good standing (GPA is 3.375). I had no idea what major to choose though, and ended up dropping out due to this. I have around $7,000 in federal student loans. I have been paying what I can on them and keeping the interest paid at minimum when I couldn't throw any extra money at them. 


I am currently working as a banker making $13/hour full time. I have had some medical issues over the years and have luckily been able to pay off all of that debt recently. My plan is to begin going to school for my Associates in the Fall of 2020. I feel like I am in a good place to do so, and am wanting some feedback regarding this. 


My bills monthly are as follows:
Car payment: $306.61
Car Insurance: $78.51
Cell Phone: $32.10
Student Loans: $46.09
Medical: $300/ around every 2 months for allergy shot vials


I have the cheapest medical insurance plan that my employer offers. They pay for it so I don't have that cost. From what I can tell I can obtain a plan for around $100 while I go to school via healthcare.gov. 


I am currently saving money so that I can continue to pay my bills because when I start school, I will be quitting my banking job because I doubt they will keep me on part-time. I have around $1300.00 in savings. The program I am wanting to be accepted into is the Medical Laboratory Tech one at a community college about 45 minutes away. I would like to work part time, but from the information I have gathered from the school, the program is very intense and they don't recommend it. I have used the FedLoan estimator for student aid, and it looks like I could be largely covered by pell grants for the cost of tuition. Total, the program will cost around $11,000 not including textbooks. I do plan on applying for as many scholarships as possible also. 


I have researched the program and it is fully accredited. I wanted to look into something in the medical field because in my area, there are not a lot of jobs. Just making over minimum wage is considered decent. The job outlook for this profession appears to be very good overall, even in my area. The average wage for the profession is $22- $27 per hour. Obviously in my area I expect it to be on the lower end. I chose an associates because I don't want to drown in student loan debt and I feel that is as long as I could go without having a full time job. 


My biggest concern is taking out additional student loans to cover my living costs while I am in school and not working enough or at all depending on what I can manage. Will it pay off and does it make financial sense? From what I can tell, the rates on the loans shouldn't be more than 4% that I could get, so as long as I get a job after graduating and start paying them off I feel like I should be okay. I would only plan to use the loans to pay bills after my savings was depleted. Most of the money would obviously be going to my car payment and insurance. 


I really do appreciate any input anyone could provide, and if I left something important out, let me know. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,I [25] recently received some money from family. Should I pay off my auto loan?,"I bought a used car from a dealership in February 2018 for about $14,500 excluding taxes and other fees. I paid a little over $8,000 cash and took out an auto loan from my bank for $8,000. I pay that loan monthly at $197.

I recently received $10K from a family member that would allow me to pay off this loan fully and own my car outright. My question is, should I do this or is there any benefit to paying the loan off over the next three years?

Interest rate is 4.24% and interest I paid last year was $270.52. I have $6,660 remaining on the loan.

Personal Details: I have no other debts, rent an apartment, and will continue to have a steady job over the next 3+ years.

I’ve had 1 credit card since April 2017, so my credit history is short but good credit score the entire time. If I don’t pay off this loan, would that help me with future financial decisions (buying a house, etc.)? Any tax-related benefits or disadvantages?",finance
personalfinance,"""Interest Rate is 2.421% during the Introductory Period and 0.995% thereafter."" Where are the REAL high-interest accounts?","EDIT: I am physically located in Silicon Valley (closest largest city is San Jose). Thanks in advance for the help.

I administer a trust, and have a life insurance check I need to deposit. Because of how assets in the trust are currently allocated, I cannot deposit into an existing trust account without exceeding the 250k FDIC insurance cap. In addition, the current accounts are all earning pathetic interest rates (think BofA level rates, losing money compared to inflation). 

Thus, I am looking for a high-yield savings account into which this check can be deposited - not forever, but at least until the taxes on the estate are paid, and distributions are made to some individuals pursuant to a(n uncontested) will. The money will likely be there for 2 years max but one year min, while the estate is settled. After that, the residual money will be more prudently invested. 

I'm loathe to use an online-only institution, as I would STRONGLY prefer to physically deliver this check to the institution for deposit. Enough mistakes have been made in this process thus far on the banking side that I do not trust the check not to be lost, and I do not want to deal with asking the insurance company to reissue in that event. 

I have been looking at online lists of ""great"" high yield savings accounts, but these lists are....somewhat dishonest? 

In some instances, the high-yield account is not really offering the advertised savings rate, but rather using it as a ""teaser"" rate for an introductory period (after which the rate drops to less than 1%). In other cases, the advertised rate is unavailable for larger deposits (e.g. they advertise 2-3%, but the fine print only offers that rate to balances less than $5-10k - buried in the fine print is the admission that a deposit of 50k or more earns, again, less than 1%)

Where can I ACTUALLY deposit this check where it will ACTUALLY earn a higher interest rate on an ongoing basis?",finance
personalfinance,Received a 1099-C for an underwater Reverse Mortgage,"Father-in-law passed away in 2017 with my wife as the executor (in CA in US).  He used an HECM Reverse Mortgage to pay off his conventional mortgage back in 2007 (before the housing crash).  Value was underwater at the time of his passing.  We turned over the house to the lender with a deed-in-lieu in 2018.  Lender sent us/estate a 1099-C for 2018 (Cancellation of Debt – debt discharge with Box 2 at $87K, box 4 saying “Reverse Mortgage”, box 5 is not checked, and box 6 is marked F for “by agreement”).  Our tax person says we owe taxes on that forgiven debt.  I don’t think that’s right.

I thought that there was never a penalty for underwater reverse mortgages.  Everyone just walks away in an underwater loan situation.  These loans are federally insured so that lender does not lose anything.  Debt wasn’t forgiven, it was paid for by FHA insurance policy he paid for in the loan origination fees.

Was this sent in error?

worldpolitics,Monte Carlo Mafia,"The House of Grimaldi rule over Monaco today and once ruled in Genoa as powerful bankers and politicians. Monaco is located right next to Italy and on the same coastline as Genoa. There are still Italian Grimaldi families called the Grimaldi di Niximas with Prince Enrico Grimaldi di Nixima, Princess Sandra Grimaldi di Nixima, Princess Caterina Grimaldi di Nixima, Andrea Grimaldi di Nixima, Princess Elvira Grimaldi di Nixima-Oetker, and Princess Beatrice Grimaldi di Serravalle. The Grimaldi di Nixima family are ruthless child murdering sadists. Nix refers to the Greek witch Nyx who is associated with the night. Princess Elvira married the billionaire Alfred Oetker whose father was a Nazi SS member. Monaco was a principality of Genoa and ruled by the Grimaldi family during the 13th century. Francois Grimaldi was the first ruler of Monaco and was nicknamed the ""Malicious One."" Today Monaco is a sovereign city state with an economy involved in casinos and operates as a haven for those trying to evade taxation. Several Scottish and British billionaires reside in Monaco like Jim McColl and Baron Irvine Laidlaw. There is no income tax in Monaco so many foreign businessmen including members of royal and noble lines operate from there to evade taxes and then conceal wealth in private bank accounts. Casinos are a popular industry in Monaco and have always gone hand in hand with organized crime which use casinos for laundering criminal profits. Casinos are the most effective tool for laundering large amounts of cash. This is even revealed in the movie Casino. This is why the Chicago Outfit set up in Las Vegas and the Five Families and Philly Mob set up in Atlantic City. Monte Carlo is a joint headquarters for the Sicilian and Russian mafias. The House of Grimaldi were the ones who established the first casinos in Monaco and are the primary owners of Monte Carlo Casino. The Grimaldis are still connected with the Genoese nobility with Prince Domenico Pallavicino as the Consulate General of Monaco in Genoa, Italy. The Pallavicini family are currently international bankers and nobles of Genoa, Milan, Vienna, and Rome.

Prince Albert II is the blood appointed head of state in Monaco and his net worth is estimated at over 1 billion however it is likely more like most members of high level royalty. They conceal their real wealth in private offshore accounts like in Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein. They also conceal their wealth in assets like corporate shares, precious metals, and land. Prince Albert II is also a Knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and runs his principality as a branch of Rome. The House of Grimaldi is intermarried with various French and Genoese noble families as well as German royals like the House of Hanover and House of Lorraine. Princess Stephanie of Monaco, Christian Louis Rainer de Massy, Baroness Elisabeth-Anne de Massy, and Baroness Christine Alix de Massy are members of the royal family of Monaco. They also work closely with the House of Doria of Genoa currently headed up by Prince Jonathan Doria-Pamphilj and the House of Savoy which had a Genoa branch. The House of Grimaldi work with white collar criminals running banks and businesses in the Black Sea region which work with mafias in the region owned by Black Nobility. The Lucchesi-Palli and Corsini families are part owners of mafias in Turkey which worked with their Italian and Corsican Mafias in the ""French Connection."" The Black Nobility of Rome are the primary owners of the Sicilian and Italian-American crime families and also own mafias in Eastern Europe and Russia. The Grimaldi di Nixima family of Sicily are also part owners and overseers of the Sicilian Mafia.

Like most Genovese nobility the House of Grimaldi is involved with banking. They were one of the families that established the Bank of Saint George in 1407. The Republic of Genoa expanded its territories into the Black Sea region and used its bank to manage these regions. The royal owned bank was known for using Jewish bankers to manage their assets and finances especially in the Black Sea region. The Ghisolfi clan intermarried with nobility around the Black Sea and this region was known as Gazaria taking its name from the more ancient Khazaria. The Ghisolfi clan managed these banks and used Gazarian agents as middle men that worked with Russia. Today Ghisolfi family owns the international chemical company Mossi Ghisolfi Group and M&amp;G Finanziaria with Vittorio Ghisolfi, Marco Ghisolfi, and Beppe Ghisolfi as a members. What people refer to as the ""Khazarian Mafia"" are the continuation of Genoese-Gazarian bankers today. There is a large amount of organized crime and criminal banking in Russia, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Crimea and these same groups are doing business in Israel and Europe. In the US the Russian Mafia in Brighton Beach, New York works under the Lucchese crime family which they pay tributes to and receive protection from with former Lucchese boss Anthony Casso ordering the assassination of Russian mobster Vladimir Reznikov who was threatening the Russian mafia boss and Lucchese associate Marat Balagula. Enrico Braggiotti is an Italian banker living in Monaco and was born in Turkey. Enrico Braggiotti has been investigated for banking corruption and bribery. Braggiotti was believed to be involved in a secret plot with the Bank of New York in taking over Irving Bank.

Enrico Braggiotti helped to funnel Black Sea mafia profits through Italian banks and then his connections with Monaco were used for transferring the wealth into Monaco to be laundered in casinos. Sergey Aksyonov is Prime Minister of Crimea and has numerous ties with organized crime and the mafia known as Salem. Aksyonov is politically backed by Vladimir Putin and part of the United Russia Party. The Russian gangster Felix Sater who has ties with Donald Trump is part of this Black Sea Mafia. Helly Nahmad is an art dealer that ran a criminal gambling operation out of his apartment at Trump Tower. The Nahmad family is from Monaco. The Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov's son Emin Agalarov set up a meeting with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Trump Jr, Kushner, and Paul Manafort. Aras Agalarov is a knight of the Italian Order of Merit. The House of Savoy owns the Genovese crime family and works closely with the Grimaldis with Prince Albert II a knight of the Savoy's Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. Prince Vittorio's wife Marina is from the Geneose Doria banking family. Vladimir Putin is a Knight of the House of Grimaldi's Order of Saint-Charles. Putin has met with Prince Albert II many times in the past 12 years and they are good friends. Putin has met with Prince Albert II in 2006, 2007, 2013, and 2016 which I can confirm. The Russian mob boss Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov said he met Putin in Monte Carlo. Tokhtakhunov is a criminal associate of the Corleonisi mafia clan of Sicily. Banco di San Giorgio is a more recent bank that used the same name because it is covertly owned by the Genoese families like the Grimaldis and Pallavicinis that owned the Bank of Saint George. Through a series of mergers Banca di San Giorgio merged with Banca Regionale Europea which absorbed into UBI Banca. Mediobanca is an Italian bank that owns the private bank Compagnie Monegasque de Banque in Monaco.

In a Federal court hearing, a lawyer for Banca Commerciale Italiana said yesterday that the banking company had entered into no secret talks with the Bank of New York to divide up Irving Bank.

It was only after Banca Commerciale decided to withdraw, and Mr. Braggiotti called to inform Mr. Rice of that decision, that Mr. Braggiotti said that if Irving and the Bank of New York ever did come to terms and had any interest in talking further with Banca Commerciale, he would be glad to listen.'

The preliminary judge Italo Ghitti signed the precautionary custody order against one of the major Italian bankers of recent years: Enrico Braggiotti, former president and managing director of the Italian commercial bank.

the judge Ghitti signed the decree: Enrico Braggiotti is officially a fugitive. ""What do you want it to be, it's a retired old man,"" minimizes one of the pm. Too bad that Braggiotti is technically a retiree but that he continues to hold a rather delicate task: he leads the Compagnie monegasque de banque, a subsidiary of the Commercial in Montecarlo.

personalfinance,Question about my savings bonds,"I recently received a bunch of US EE Bonds from my Grandmother and I have a few questions about how they work. 

[Bonds](https://i.imgur.com/ihToYJU.png)

I've read that they earn their assigned interest rate is good for 20 years and then the Treasury assigns a new rate for the next 20 years. Is the interest rate on the lookup the original rate or the current rate?

Also I know I would face income tax when cashing these bonds normally. I know there are a few exceptions though. My Grandmother purchased them and so her name is on the bonds as well. Could I cash them to pay off my wife's student loans and avoid paying taxes on the value? Are there any other ways to avoid the income tax?

Lastly I'm curious if there would be a better secure rate available to reinvest this money or just let it ride. 2% feels like a solid secure rate and 4% is definitely nice. I don't need access to this money currently but it is nice that I can liquidate it fairly easily without penalty currently.

Thank you",finance

worldpolitics,Radical Agenda-Emergent Reee,"Bipartisanship, it has been said, is a euphemism for double penetration. Whenever the stupid party and the evil party agree on a piece of legislation, you know something really terrible is about to occur.

After the longest government shutdown in the history of the republic, Trump learned not to play chicken with Democrats. More importantly, the Democrats fully realized that they had no reason to negotiate with the President. The Left doesn’t mind if the country is destroyed. Not only will they let the borders go unprotected, and the government unfunded, they’ll happily stop feeding their government dependent constituents, and support the riots which would predictably ensue. They don’t need enough power to govern, they just need enough power to obstruct, and with that they can get whatever they want, because Republicans would rather cave than destroy the country through inaction.

In response, Trump has declared a national emergency, and announced plans to take wall funding from other parts of the budget, which have already been allocated.

Democrats have pledged to sue, and some are plotting a bill to block the use of emergency powers. Nancy Pelosi boldly said that the next Democrat president, could use the precedent set by Trump’s use of emergency powers to take action hostile to the second amendment.

In short, we’ve been taken to the woodshed, and despite this massive victory for their party and ideology, the Democrats are still plotting their revenge.

The temptation here is obviously to condemn Trump as a failure and blackpill about his imminent defeat in 2020. The Republican Party had two years of congressional majorities and squandered them on tax cuts and prison reform, then gave a handful of vocal communists everything they wanted, just to keep the country from falling apart. Not the type of performance you expect from the author of “The Art of the Deal”.
And indeed, we ought to kiss our country goodbye. Trump’s presidency, one way or another, is going to mark the end of the United States as we know it. What has become painfully obvious to an increasing number of people is that Democrats and Republicans have less in common with one another than the United States has in common with Russia. These are not different political parties squabbling over policy, but different governments competing over territory.

This was not a legislative negotiation. This was Democrats handing Republicans a demand for unconditional surrender, and the Republicans acquiescing thereto.
They can be forgiven for that surrender, but the question becomes what to do next. If we’ve got to capitulate to radical communists who hate the country and want to destroy it, just to keep the charade going for another couple of months, alright, then let’s cope with that emergency, while plotting a course to avoid that outcome in the future. One third of a wall is not going to stop the demographic changes that are on track to grant Democrats a permanent majority in Washington.

If the Left is ready to destroy the country with a thin majority in the House, imagine what they’ll do with actual power? They absolutely have to be stopped, and that’s going to require greater emergency powers than shuffling $8 billion across a federal ledger. The Republicans need to use their powers like Democrats do, or there won’t be anything left of America to salvage.
For example, Andrew McCabe is running around giving interviews about how he used his position at the FBI to stage a coup against the President. Comey, Clapper, and Brennan all lied under oath to Congress. Communists have been rioting from coast to coast for years without any meaningful repercussions. What does the Justice Department do? Indict James Fields, RAM, and Roger Stone.

William Barr and Kirstjen Nielsen need to fire every Democrat in Homeland and Justice, and replace them all with partisan Republicans. They need to open investigations into the Clinton Foundation, and other Democrat power centers. They need to initiate anti-trust and campaign finance actions against the big tech companies, and enjoin every Left wing activist group that has collaborated with them on censorship, such as the SPLC. They need to stop going after so called “White supremacists” and restore order to our streets by indicting every public Antifa apologist for conspiracy against the United States.
We cannot get the wall in Trump’s first term, so if Trump wants a second term, he’s going to take other wins elsewhere. Lock up Clinton for violations of the espionage act. Lock up Brennan, Comey, and Clapper for perjury. Lock up McCabe for sedition. Bring federal charges against Tom Keenan and Tom Massey for initiating the riots in Charlottesville, and lean on them until they give up their co conspirators.

The Left gets everything they want because they have absolutely nothing to fear, and the Right gets taken to the cleaners because they are terrified of the Left. We cannot change the makeup of congress for the next two years, and it is surely too late to save America from demographic collapse, but this much can be changed.

Give these people something to be afraid of, Mr. President!",technology

personalfinance,BayArea - Secondary home Keep renting or Cash out profit and invest in Index,"\-- Throwaway account --

last year we moved up for our primary resident and kept our first property and rent it out. As current tenant's lease is ending, we are wondering if we should sell property and take the profit and invest in Index. We are still in 5 year period where we can claim 500K tax free.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Mortgage + Property tax + Insurance = $3200 

Rent = $3900

With monthly $250 expense budget Yearly cashflow is around $5000/ year 

Current Equity in home - $800K. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Reason to keep it rented.**

* Bay area home appreciation
* Lower interest rate - 3.375 with $400K left on mortgage
* Within 5 mile radius of future Google Transit village + New Adobe 4000 employee campus 
* Expected job growth in San Jose downtown in next 7-8 year is 30 - 40K Tech jobs. Double the current office space.
* Lower property tax - Prop 13
* Allow us to downsize if we need to in future and live in desirable neighborhood for $3200 in Bay area.

  
*Exit Amount Calculation*

|Number of Years|2 % Appreciation|3 % Appreciation|4% Appreciaton|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|5|1,103,128|1,148,128|1,223,128|
|10|1,365,231|1,525,231|1,699,231|
|15|1,691,486|1,965,486|2,281,486|

&amp;#x200B;

Exit price =  Total Price + Cashflow - Mortgage owed - Expenses

5 Year expense  = $250/Month + $10K

10 Year expense = $250/Month + $20K 

15 Year expense = $250/Month + $35K

&amp;#x200B;

**Reason To Sell:**

* Major equity/NW invested in same kind of Asset and in Same Market
* Higher mortgage on 2nd home. Offset some of that by putting more money in it. Thinking putting $200K to reduce monthly payments
* @ 3 % appreciation home price in 10 years will be $1.8M. Fear that Bay area Salary will keep up with that to support medium size home. Affordability will reduce demand.
* Take 500K tax free
* Feeling that we may have bought 2nd property at peak, take profit from first home at peak to offset that.
* Not leveraging higher equity in home.
* Take the nice run in home appreciation and tax benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the calculation both the investment may return similar results. In 10 Year horizon. 

?? Am I missing anything in my calculation. 

?? How would you calculate numbers for similar comparison.

personalfinance,APY help,"Hey guys I am new to this subreddit but I have learned so much from being here. Long time lurker, first time poster.

I recently inherited a little bit of money and I want to save it. I started looking at saving options and realized I know nothing about interest or APY. You guys immediately came to mind when I started reading these options. 

I basically have three options for a savings account with my bank. One is a 0.10% interest rate and APY. One fits me into a 0.20% interest rate and APY without the option of increasing my interest rate until I double the amount of money in the account, the other is a 0.35% interest rate and APY but I have to keep the entire amount in the account or I get a monthly service charge. 

I dont think I will have any problem keeping the savings in the bank but there is always the unknown variables. For now I guess I'd like a little explanation on what this would look like for 15k and could someone explain the difference between interest and APY for me please?

personalfinance,24 yrs old - 9K in savings but abysmal credit score...,"Decided I would finally start tackling one of my glaring flaws this year, financial literacy. I've been lurking through this subreddit for the last few months but am finally posting here for the first time to help navigate through a bit of a credit crisis I find myself in.

So the backdrop- 
I've ignorantly, albeit selfishly, had tunnel vision since I started working at 18 and strictly focused on maximizing cashflow and earning potential while sacrificing credit. I grew up with absolutely zero financial discipline other than watching my parents get hosed during the great recession, so my MO has been to have as much set aside for a rainy day as possible, while minimizing debt.

Now I'm in a stage of my life where I have finally have a steady salary (I started out in skilled labor as a welder, and have been in technical sales for the last 2 years), a savings account closing in on 10K, no significant debt*, but such a poor credit score I can't conceivably get a new car or apply for a mortgage without looking at horrendous interest. 

The last 2 years I was working in a high comission sales job in the energy business, and was able to squirrel away quite a bit of savings. I quit in November once I signed a contract of employment for an engineering firm, coasted off savings and a nice reimbursement for accrued PTO, and started working at the new gig in January. 

January of 2019 is also the first time in my life I've ever documented my expenses and budgeted (Shout out to this subreddit for providing ample material and resources for helping me out BIGLY with this step)

Currently I'm grossing $4,150/mo, and my total expenses are $2,500-$2,650/mo.
*this is including everything from rent to meals out with my girlfriend. 

I only have 1 credit card from capital one, with a credit limit of $300. The only thing I load up on it are my subscriptions for streaming services and the occasional Amazon purchase. I have no idea what APR I signed up with 6 months ago, and never really cared as I always pay off in full, and never really get more than $200 loaded on it each month. 

My FICO is between 529-540, depending on the agency. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why my score was plateaued here for the last 6 months, as I always made good on my bills, until I pulled my credit report for the very first time on Thursday. The only debt I have is $2,920, which I found out about for the first time also on the report this week through Capital One's credit service. 

The debt is made of mostly two student loans from the Dept. of Education.
For context, I attended a university for one semester right out of HS, before having to drop out to make a living (that's a whole other story...) in a high cost of living city. I dont recall filling out any paperwork, let alone receiving any funds directly, but obviously something was filled out when I was 17 by myself or a parent to where I have (2) 6 year old outstanding loans in my name for $1,112 and $1,611.
*the remaining $197 is from an emergency visit to the eye doctor from over a year ago that I never settled up on apparently and is now in collections. This I plan on squaring away asap on Monday...

I haven't ever made payments on the student loans- for the most part, I haven't even received correspondence from the Department of Education or Navient about the debt. I did get some mail at a previous address, but to be honest, I got a grant to go to a trade school years ago and I always chalked it up to spam related to that. 

Are the student loans something I can (1) negotiate down to make a lump payment, (2) pay off in full or (3) should I start to start making payments each month in an attempt to build credit? I dont even know what the interest rates are, tbh. 
I feel very fortunate to have enough tucked away in a savings account to take of this (although I am gutted at the notion of having to dip into it for this- it took several years to accumulate and I'm looking at it as almost of 1/3rd of it marked to get out of a hole I didnt know I was in) and really was hoping to get some guidance and/or direction on how to proceed. 

Are there any other steps I could be taking to proactively up my credit score?",finance
personalfinance,What to claim on w-4?,"Fan somebody tell me what I'm supposed to put on my w4 for the year? I got back money on my taxes this year and want to change that.

personalfinance,Trying to help my roommate out after a series of super unfortunate events and need some help.,"Alright so long story short on how we got to where we are now. Basically my roommate (roomie 1) and lifelong best friend worked for a large, multi billion dollar, international beverage company and ended up injuring his back. He wasn't technically let go (he's basically ""on leave"") so his application for disability and unemployment were denied and the company isn't providing worker's comp or even paying the medical bills (they just keep coming in the mail) from when they sent him to Concentra to get checked out. I'm pretty sure all of that is currently being taken care of as he's sought out legal help and has a lawyer working on the medical bills, wrongful rejection/denial of disability/unemployment/worker's comp as well as lost wages and damages due to the back injury. The pretrial was a few weeks ago but I can't remember what he told me about that. This has all just been a super slow process.

So this is the big problem now, he has 2 bulging discs and a herniated disc in his back which causes him severe pain if he's standing or walking for an hour or more at a time. He's also at risk of rupturing the disc if he doesn't follow the restrictions etc. He was placed on a 10 pound lifting restriction by the doctor before he lost his insurance. These two things make finding work extremely difficult for him, especially when almost all of the work and experience he has is on manual labor style jobs.

He's now roughly 4 months out since he last worked, drained the little savings he had and has wracked up quite a bit of credit card debt just on essentials , as well as becoming behind on stuff like the tags on his car, auto insurance, and auto payments.

I'm very familiar with all the standard steps like getting and doing whatever job you can and minimizing all expenses etc. We've done that. Roomie 1's portion of rent was being paid to Roomie 2 with magic cards (who would have thought a single magic card would be worth $500+). Roomie 2 is now just covering the rent for now. Utilities are all in my name so I just have been covering all portions of his utilities as well as misc things like extra grocery shopping to meal prep, the tags for his car, paying when we do stuff so he doesn't have to use the little income he has when we wanna hang out and do something.

His bills basically break down to about $750 a month right now.

Auto payment - $380

Insurance $175

Phone $85

Credit card min. Payment - $25

Gas depends on how much work is available for him.

His income is very hit or miss, some weeks he has a ton of work and makes a decent chunk then the next week he has zero work. He has accepted every odd job that won't cause him any further injury, most of these are under the table things from his friends and my family. I pulled a ton of strings and got him an interview for a decent paying, entry level contingent job (contingent status but hours are basically always available, especially on nights) at the hospital I work at.

These are the current problems. He had called his auto loan servicer to let them know about his financial hardship and how to not end up in hot water. They told him as long as he makes a small payment on the amount every month they would put a note on his account and consider that a good intention deal and he'd be fine for a few months. Fast forward a few weeks and he got a letter from the servicer saying his vehicle would be out for repossession due to a full payment not being posted in the past 65 days and if he needs to make a full payment in the next 5 days to prevent that and then to keep it from going back to repossession status he has to make 3 on time and full monthly payments in a row.

On top of that his auto loan still has 17,000 on it at an 11.6% interest rate. Long story on this, but basically this was the best he was able to get due to a short credit history but was well within his budget a year and a half ago when he was working.

So this is where I need help.

In the short term the goal is to lower the monthly payments (and hopefully interest rate as well) on the car by hopefully refinancing the loan as well as stopping the stupid fast accrual of interest on the credit cards. Hopefully then he'll be able to at least be able to get himself caught up on the bare minimum essentials like his car payment, auto insurance, tags, etc. Long term is using settlement money from the lawsuit to pay off his debts and then get some type of education so he's marketable for a job that fits the physical limitations he has.

Since his credit isn't all that great, and I was hoping to maximize the potential benefits, I was planning on making him an authorized user on one of my credit cards so he'd get my credit history (was like 640's last he checked) to pad his numbers. My score is 768, short history and I'm a bit of a casual churner. My understanding is that if I make him an authorized user everything on my credit report gets reported on his, which I'm assuming will include the auto loan and student loans I have, and his credit won't impact me in any way.

If I add him as an authorized user, obviously having the good credit bump helps, but will having the student and auto loans on there hurt him if he were to try to refinance his loan or apply for a new credit card? He doesn't have any family or anything that can help and I don't want to co-sign for the loan so this is the only real option.

When it comes to the actual auto loan refinancing, is there anything special or specific to check into or look out for to get him the lowest rates and payment?

He had started putting money away into a fidelity 401(k) that was matched by the employer. Is there a way he can withdraw all this money with minimal penalties (like only income tax or something?) to put towards some of these issues?

personalfinance,First time car buyer taken for a Ride,"Hey everyone, so I didn't read the Wiki, like a complete noob, and I just bought a new to me car. I ended up with all of the insurance  and maintenance plans as well as getting a terrible interest rate of 6.3%.

I'm planning on canceling all the insurance and maintenance tomorrow. Litterly the day after I got it and eating the $150 in paperwork fees.

As for fixing my interest rate. How do I do this before everything spirals out of control? I feel so foolish for getting dooped and I actually got sick thinking about what I did.

Do I simply just go to a bank or credit union to see if they want to refinance my car?

Can you help point out the error of our ways?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Family of 4, with 2 kids under 8.  Post-tax income just shy of $5600 a month, combined with the two adults, including FTB and rent assistance (which I hate but has been a godsend).

&amp;#x200B;

|Item|Monthly Cost|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rent|$1750|This is a good price for the area and is close to my eldest child's school and our workplaces.  Renting further out isn't a real option as the cost does not drop a lot but you start spending more on fuel.  As it is we are an hour away from the city.|
|Car repayment|$300|2 years left at this rate, reasonable interest rate.  It's not a new car, second hand with low repayments.|
|Car and Home/Content insurances|$120|RACV, combined with discounts for long-term RACV membership (parents signed me up when I was in nappies) and multi-policy.|
|Electricty, Gas, Water|$300-400|Depending on the month and usage, electricity higher in summer for cooling, gas higher in winter for heating.  We don't keep the house icy cold in summer, or toasty in winter (ie, use blankets and extra layers in winter, dress appropriately in summer and use portable fans and spray bottles)|
|Mobiles|$60|Two Sim-only plan mobiles with unlimited calling and text, plus international which my partner needs.  Looking at swapping this possibly once contract expires, thinking Belong as it includes an unlimited international option.  Partners family can't/wont use whatsapp / Signal or other data-using mobile apps for calls (elderly and techno phobic)|
|Internet|$79|Aussie Broadband.  Can drop to $69 plan, require the unlimited data option due to using a lot of streaming and for my work (out of hours, but I get paid for WFH).|
|Petrol and Tolls|$150|Can probably cut some here, tolls are a work expense but I can only claim on taxes (no direct reimbursement).  The convenience for driving to other sites (billable hours) probably outweighs the cost of not using.|
|Food|$600-800|Family of 4, with two growing (and I mean eat-you-out-of-house-and-home) kids.  We are trying to bulk buy and save food costs, eat a lot of pasta / noodles / rice.  Talking with other similar families, this is a reasonable/normal spend.  We don't smoke and drinking is limited to special occasions (eg, buy a slab of beer around one of our birthdays and it lasts a few weeks)|
|Childcare|$750-1000|This is after CCS.  Need 5 days as we are both working.|
|Credit Card Repayment|$1000|Trying to knock down the remaining $12k from initial $18 we had combined.  Not doing bad but slow going.  Reducing this under $1k payment a month doesn't seem to make a dent otherwise due to interest.|
|Emergency Fund|$430|Needed to dip into this recently, I have a mental thing about having three months of rent saved up at minimum.  Once we have the $5250 accrued we will be throwing this at the credit card instead.|
|Spotify|$12|Our only ""guilty"" pleasure, I use it when chained to my desk or driving long distances.|
|TOTAL|$5551-$6101|We obvsiously don't put as much on the CC or into emergency fund on the ""bad"" months.|

1. What would you recommend we do, to cut costs or change things?
2. Where are we going wrong?

Note that the above costs exclude stuff our extended families help out with (extracurricular activities for the kids like swimming lessons, gymnastics, and ballet) and exclude other costs like car servicing, rego, ambulance membership ($180 for 3 years)

personalfinance,"Preparing for graduation, uncertain employment following","I'm currently a graduate student finishing a master's in math in May, and while I have an assistanceship position now making not so great money, I have a sort of strange set of assets due to the generosity of my parents. I am unsure how immediately I can find a job, and whether it will necessarily be a lucrative one- I'm in Kentucky, which is not the best place for my career path, but has a relatively low cost of living, so I don't need to make a particularly large amount of money to get by (e.g. $70k is beyond my wildest dreams). If I have to work hourly at Walmart or something for a bit so be it, but my plan is to hopefully go straight from grad school to a salaried position. I have a thread going about that on /r/math that will hopefully help, because the career and coop center at my university wasn't too helpful. It's not totally hopeless, but it could end up being a couple months before I find anything, and I'm unsure what my starting pay will look like if I do find something.

Getting to that strange set of assets, I currently have a house and not a car, and I have never been in any form of debt in my life (got through school on a full ride), so my debt to income ratio is literally 0, but idk where that puts my credit. My parents bought a 2nd house for me to live in with a paying roommate (to help them with mortgage payments, and not have to pay for the house entirely on their own), and I am unsure what sort of progress they have made as far as paying it off. Upon graduation, they insist that I either begin paying rent, i.e. the mortgage (as far as I know about $800ish), or move away for work, which I'm generally reluctant to do given that situation. The idea is that eventually they either sign the house over to me, or I move away and they become landlords and begin charging the new tenants more so they come out ahead and have that as a strange sort of retirement investment. I'm reluctant to walk away from a partially paid-off house by moving for potentially better jobs, especially given cost of living will just rise along with my starting pay most places I've looked, but if my future income is uncertain, repairs and such could be a problem.

However, not having a car whatsoever is a huge problem, because unless I happen to work somewhere along the bus route (we have an awful public transit system), I'm pretty screwed there. If I literally dont spend a cent besides bills until I graduate, I'm looking at like $4k at most to put towards that. It's likely possible to get a used car for that, but in the face of uncertainty regarding my income level, in unsure that would be wise because I would likely be unable to pay the maintenance costs on it. On the other hand, if I take out a loan for a nicer one, I'm unsure what the interest rate would look like with no credit history, and thus cannot properly estimate what the payments would look like. Same with insurance.

Tl;dr I've been given the holy gift of a debt-free education and partly paid-off house, but no car, and an uncertain financial future following graduation. Any advice?",finance

\- I had about 7k in savings before but basically all of it went to Christmas this year and getting myself into this studio

\-Student loan debt of almost 16k (started at around 40k). Interest of 3.5 percent average.  I'm paid ahead, so technically I don't need to make another payment until 2021. Regardless, I'm making payments of about $320 a month. 

\-No credit card debt

\-Contributing 6 percent of income to 401k

I'm thinking of simply keeping 10k in my savings (BOA) and putting 10k into a Vanguard account and investing in the S&amp;P 500. I can't invest in individual stocks and bonds because my work doesn't allow it. We have insight into lots of sensitive info and the company doesn't want any insider trading scandals. I would continue to contribute my bonuses to this account.

I want to have 10k in cash on hand in case of an emergency, but I'm not sure if BOA is the best place to keep it. Some people on this reddit have recommended Alloy, but I really know nothing about that.

personalfinance,Should I go $400k in Debt for Dental School?,"Hi,

I am pre-dental and am having to bear the stress of deciding whether or not to pull out of the running for a dental school that I believe costs far too much. So this is my first cycle of applications, my stats are average to above average for just about every dental school. I applied to six schools and I interviewed at three, two in-state and one out-of-state. For my in-state schools, if all scholarship options are applied that I would have very decent chance of receiving, the tuition comes to around $115k for all four years (not including living expenses). This is more than ideal, but I did not receive an acceptance from either of them. I have a meeting with both schools in the next couple of weeks to talk about what I could have done better.

Now here comes my dilemma, I interviewed a couple of days ago at a school that would cost around $320k for tuition and let's say $80k for living expenses and other little fees along the way. I have no debt from undergrad and currently have a job paying around $40k a year that I actually really enjoy.  This school has a high acceptance rate for out-of-state students, so I am leaning on wanting to call them and ask them to remove me from consideration before they send me an acceptance. Pre-dental students on the internet see denying an acceptance as a problem, because it is thought that other schools can somehow see this. I understand that I should have asked these questions before applying to this school, but here we are and I'm conflicted. As an aside, my girlfriend is applying to med schools around our state this august, so staying close would be great in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't see how $400k makes sense to become a dentist when considering how high interest rates are. Dentists can make +$200k, but that's after a few years of establishing a practice. A more reasonable salary for a dentist out of school would be more like $130k (before taxes). I've also heard peak income is what should be calculated when considering a lost year of income, but I would much rather enjoy my 30's than to have a few extra bucks in my 60's. I don't want to live a lavish lifestyle anytime in my life, I just want to be comfortable and enjoy my years. I love my two in-state institutions, so should I just wait a year to hopefully get into these schools? I have a ton of additional experiences that would boost my application for this cycle.

last year we moved up for our primary resident and kept our first property and rent it out. As current tenant's lease is ending, we are wondering if we should sell property and take the profit and invest in Index. We are still in 5 year period where we can claim 500K tax free.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Mortgage + Property tax + Insurance = $3200

Rent = $3900

With monthly $250 expense budget Yearly cashflow is around $5000/ year

Current Equity in home - $800K.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reason to keep it rented.**

* Bay area home appreciation
* Lower interest rate - 3.375 with $400K left on mortgage
* Within 5 mile radius of future Google Transit village + New Adobe 4000 employee campus
* Expected job growth in San Jose downtown in next 7-8 year is 30 - 40K Tech jobs. Double the current office space.
* Lower property tax - Prop 13
* Allow us to downsize if we need to in future and live in desirable neighborhood for $3200 in Bay area.

5 Year expense  = $250/Month + $10K

10 Year expense = $250/Month + $20K

15 Year expense = $250/Month + $35K

&amp;#x200B;

**Reason To Sell:**

* Major equity/NW invested in same kind of Asset and in Same Market
* Higher mortgage on 2nd home. Offset some of that by putting more money in it. Thinking putting $200K to reduce monthly payments
* @ 3 % appreciation home price in 10 years will be $1.8M. Fear that Bay area Salary will keep up with that to support medium size home. Affordability will reduce demand.
* Take 500K tax free
* Feeling that we may have bought 2nd property at peak, take profit from first home at peak to offset that.
* Not leveraging higher equity in home.
* Take the nice run in home appreciation and tax benefit.

personalfinance,Graduate Student Loan Question,"I will be going back to graduate school in May and am looking at my loan options. I currently have ~$20,000 In debt from undergrad which is from government loans and am thinking I’ll have to take out around $85000 for tuition and living expenses for my two years of grad school. 

My credit score is over 800 and I have no other debt besides the current student loan, so would it be smarter for me to try to get private loans at a better interest rate? Or should I take out graduate plus loans through the government and then once I graduate and get a job, refinance with a private lender to get a better rate on all the debt? 

My degree will be in a well paying, high demand field where I’m expecting to make at least $90,000/year so I’m not too worried about needing the protections offered by federal loans, and I plan on paying them back as quickly as possible, hopefully in less than five years after graduation. 

TL;DR - I have a high credit score (&gt;800) with $20,000 in government student loans currently. I am estimating $85,000 for two years of grad school. Should I use apply for a government loan and refinance privately later, or go private now?",finance

To paint a picture of my situation, my dad's been unemployed for 2 years, and my mom's income is less than $20k/yr, plus her debt eats up most of it. We're living in a relative's house, and so the four of us -- including my sister -- share a small room with bunk beds. We have ZERO savings for college \*slap in the face\*, so if I want to get a higher education, it would all come down to scholarships/grants and loans. Unfortunately, the scholarships I qualify for don't cover the full cost of going to the ""nice"" universities, so it trickles down to loans as my last option. Yet another misfortune though: mom and dad's credit is in the gutter (due to a business endeavor gone south), so Parent Plus loan is a no-go with those interest rates. However, that leaves me with the option of taking subsidized and/or unsubsidized loans under my own name, but like most of my peers, I don't know much about money management and finance. However, I do know about the power of investing and compounding. I've been reading up on all the theory behind building wealth, managing your money and whatnot (love this subreddit, btw), but I'm under the impression that student loans make slaves of people, which is exactly the opposite of the life I want to give myself and my family, so I'm wondering whether I should take out any loans at all. I mean, I've also considered getting an A.A. at my community college, and possibly (or possibly not) doing a transfer program for my B.A. But I feel like I'm rambling now...

&amp;#x200B;

So to get to the point: considering the fact that my family is not a viable source of funding, but also weighing that I want to have a good college experience and reap all the benefits w/o becoming a slave of debt after I graduate, what are my best options in your best opinion? And also, like I said, I'm still inexperienced with managing my own money (I only have about $400 stored away in a checking account from when I used to work at Chick-Fil-A), but experienced or not, I'm completely enamored with the idea of becoming an investment tycoon and just be like ""fuck you, system!"" \*takes a sip of his martini\*. Of course, I don't wanna go gung-ho on this without something to fall back on, and also, I'm aware of the effort required. Regardless, how can I put this small amount of money in my checking account to work for me RIGHT NOW so I can get my first taste of investing and but also maybe produce me some passive income?

Please let me know if I'm off on any of this and what you think you would do in my situation.

I like the topics of finance and investing, (though I forgot to mention, I may also be into computer science) but I don't really have the money-managing experience to back up whatever knowledge I may have on finance. In your opinion, should I go to college (or more like how should I finance it without getting into crippling debt), and also, what sort of asset or financial instrument should I put the little money that I do have ($400 dollars) to make me some short-term money that I can re-invest?

2. Federal student loan $11,710 @ 4.200%. $127 minimum, I pay $250 for a  5 year timeline (4.5 yrs. left)
3. Vehicle. $26,500 @ 3.29%, $499 minimum. (worst decision I could've have made right out of school, i'm fully aware now and wish i considered personal finance just only 1 year ago.)

I just bought the vehicle. It's less than 1 year old. I have considered selling it, but I don't think I'll get what I still owe on it. 

Assuming I keep the vehicle and drive it into the ground, how should I attack the rest?

&amp;#x200B;

The Original plan was to have a timeline of 5 years to kill the loans. I'll still be able to save about 18% of my income (9% savings+ 6% 401k + 3% 401k company match)

&amp;#x200B;

However, Im considering altering my plan where I kill the the debt asap and abandon all saving. I'm thinking of paying the minimum on my 4.2% SL, and killing the 4.8% SL within 3 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or should focus more on saving for retirement as I am already 26 without any substantial retirement savings?

personalfinance,Is 60k in student loans reasonable for my situation?,"I was just accepted into UC Berkeley for their computer science program. I do not get any financial aid, so my parents will be paying about half of my cost of attendance. 

Before I go to college, I’ll have abt 12k in liquid assets and I plan on getting a credit card when I turn 18.

My parents have had me on their capital one card as an authorized user for about a year, and I’m wondering if that helps my credit in any way.

After graduating college, I would have about 30k in federal loans while the other 30k would be me paying back to my parents.

People in this sub usually say anything over 20k in student loans is ridiculous but I’m wondering if it’s financially responsible for me to take 60k out especially because it’s a great school that has pretty high starting salary averages for my major (100k)

personalfinance,Hoping to buy a home soon. Do we have to pay our student loans off first?,"My wife and I are looking to buy a house as soon as reasonably possible. Right now we thought that September 2020 was reasonable. After some preliminary searching we'd like to set our price point at the $325k range with \~10% down. We plan to have $50k (including e-fund) saved up by the end of the year. I understand that in home ownership the importance of an e-fund goes up and that there are closing costs, therefore I think we should probably have \~$70k saved before being truly ready to buy.

**Current Status:**

E-Fund: 13k (\~3mo.)

Monthly savings rate: $2600 this doesn't account for those 3 paycheck months

Rent: 1100/mo

Credit Scores: Me at 760 and Wife at 810

**Income:**

Net: $8k/mo combined again leaving out the 3 paycheck months

**Debt:** 

$13k on car @ $272/mo

$15.5k on private student loans (5.5%) @ $340/mo

$56k on federal student loans (5% avg.) @ $315/mo Most of these are on Extended Graduated Repayment so payments are low and will go up. I plan to have them payed off early.

I know that the general wisdom of this sub is that we should pay off the student loans first, however we have some personal extenuating circumstances that push us to move buying a home up on the list of priorities. 

Our question is: how much does DTI really factor into mortgage application? If we already meet the requirements is there anything to be gained by paying off the private student loans and reducing monthly debt obligations prior to applying? Is it better to use that 15k as a down payment asap or to pay off the loan? Again, our goal isn't minimize to minimize the student loan cost but to make a relatively good decision in buying a home.

personalfinance,I've read here it can make more sense to finance a vehicle instead of paying cash as you can make that extra money work instead of dumping it. But how exactly does one do that?,"I've been saving to buy a new car and have been reading about the details of financing, leasing, etc. Something I frequently have seen is financing can result in a better deal as the dealer can negotiate more on it *and* low interest rates can work in your favor. Several comments have said you can outpace those interest rates on your financing by making interest on that money elsewhere. However, I'm not really sure what's the best way to do that.

Of course, there's throwing it in a savings account, but if you've got a 2% financing rate and a 2.2% interest rate, how much are you really getting? The other thought I had were CDs, which have a bit higher interest rates, but you need to continuously withdraw money from it to pay your financing. Since there's early withdrawal fees and Ally at least doesn't allow partial withdrawals, this wouldn't make sense.

So, how exactly do you take advantage of this sort of thing? I'd love to maximize my money here. Thanks!",finance
worldpolitics,A Californian's View on Progressivism,"San Francisco is a “sanctuary city”, proud to be what it thinks of itself as America’s most Progressive-Socialist city. The city has:— many hundreds of formal/written/documented complaints weekly (more than 2600 in one recent January 2019 week) about human feces (or “shit” to our progressive enlightened friends) on the street, in parks, and in other all other public places; residents in the city, therefore, implemented a “POOP” or “Human Waste” Map, that tells visitors and residents which neighborhoods to avoid because of the overwhelming amount of human waste on the streets and sidewalks and other public places prevent walking and – realistically — breathing.

As if feces and urine everywhere are not bad enough, the city government is formal, by design, turning the city into one large, outdoor illegal drug market. The city distributes more than 8.5 million hypodermic syringes and needles yearly to its growing horde of drug addicts; so drug addicts in various states of violent withdrawal or near-death comas or states of aggression completely clog the city’s commuter train (BART) stations. Not to be all negative, the State and many cities in California have one BIG accomplishment for 2018: they have banned plastic straws. Yes, plastic straws. I guess they wanted to make sure there is enough plastic for the free hypodermic syringes they are giving out.

But filth is not the city’s only issue. The FBI in March of 2018 ranked San Francisco as the city with the highest crime rate in the country, besting the former crime-king, Memphis. For example, in 2017 the city’s residents were burdened with 62,000 car burglaries of locked cars in lighted areas or during daylight hours (residents put signs in their car windows begging people not to break their windows again or steal anything from their cars).

The city of San Diego, adjacent to the Mexican border, is itself recovering from a third Hepatitis A outbreak from human waste by again washing its downtown streets nightly – every night – with bleach; a $16,000,000 effort each time.

The State has the country’s highest income tax (and the highest capital gains tax in the entire WORLD, the whole GLOBE), sales tax, gasoline tax, unemployment tax, and workers compensation tax.

And, lucky us, we also have the only Cap and Trade tax in the country, a “secret tax” administered by a State of California Corporation formed and based 3000 miles away in Delaware.

Under the heading of criminal justice reform, the State has recently reduced 154 crimes, 36 of them violent crimes, in the State from felonies to mere misdemeanor status and released tens of thousands of violent-career inmates from prison early.
In August last Governor Moonbeam (Jerry Brown) signed bail reform into law outlawing money bail. Combined, these new laws have ballooned both the crime problem and the homelessness problem; which was already the most vicious and horrible in the nation.

Speaking of homelessness, since the government began focusing on solving the problem, the state’s homeless population has more than tripled; it is like a homeless manufacturing and marketing plan. Five years ago, L.A.’s homeless population was 42,000; last year’s count was 157,000.

Reform Network ranks California as the second worst “Judicial Hellhole” in the Country. CEO magazine has ranked California the worst state in the Country to do business in for the 28th straight year; almost three decades.
California’s public schools are among the worst in the country. National tests place California students 49th (reading) and 51st (math) in the nation and our seven territories and protectorates.

According to the Federal government, California’s Cost of living is 51% higher than the national average.

personalfinance,Looking for input on a career change at 28 and the financial repercussions of obtaining more student debt.,"I hope that I am posting to the correct subreddit, if not please feel free to redirect me to one that best suits my post.

I am a 28 year old female who is planning on going back to school to obtain an associates degree. I think it will help me earn more and give me better job security in the long run. My goal is to be able to support myself comfortably. I will try to give as many details as possible regarding where I am at financially.
I have worked a full time job since I graduated high school. I did attend college in my early twenties and have around 12 credit hours in good standing (GPA is 3.375). I had no idea what major to choose though, and ended up dropping out due to this. I have around $7,000 in federal student loans. I have been paying what I can on them and keeping the interest paid at minimum when I couldn't throw any extra money at them.

I am currently working as a banker making $13/hour full time. I have had some medical issues over the years and have luckily been able to pay off all of that debt recently. My plan is to begin going to school for my Associates in the Fall of 2020. I feel like I am in a good place to do so, and am wanting some feedback regarding this.

My bills monthly are as follows: Car payment: $306.61 Car Insurance: $78.51 Cell Phone: $32.10 Student Loans: $46.09 Medical: $300/ around every 2 months for allergy shot vials
I have the cheapest medical insurance plan that my employer offers. They pay for it so I don't have that cost. From what I can tell I can obtain a plan for around $100 while I go to school via healthcare.gov.

I am currently saving money so that I can continue to pay my bills because when I start school, I will be quitting my banking job because I doubt they will keep me on part-time. I have around $1300.00 in savings. The program I am wanting to be accepted into is the Medical Laboratory Tech one at a community college about 45 minutes away. I would like to work part time, but from the information I have gathered from the school, the program is very intense and they don't recommend it. I have used the FedLoan estimator for student aid, and it looks like I could be largely covered by pell grants for the cost of tuition. Total, the program will cost around $11,000 not including textbooks. I do plan on applying for as many scholarships as possible also.
I have researched the program and it is fully accredited. I wanted to look into something in the medical field because in my area, there are not a lot of jobs. Just making over minimum wage is considered decent. The job outlook for this profession appears to be very good overall, even in my area. The average wage for the profession is $22- $27 per hour. Obviously in my area I expect it to be on the lower end. I chose an associates because I don't want to drown in student loan debt and I feel that is as long as I could go without having a full time job.

My biggest concern is taking out additional student loans to cover my living costs while I am in school and not working enough or at all depending on what I can manage. Will it pay off and does it make financial sense? From what I can tell, the rates on the loans shouldn't be more than 4% that I could get, so as long as I get a job after graduating and start paying them off I feel like I should be okay. I would only plan to use the loans to pay bills after my savings was depleted. Most of the money would obviously be going to my car payment and insurance.

I really do appreciate any input anyone could provide, and if I left something important out, let me know. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,"Filing taxes with TurboTax, Credit Karma, and FreeTaxUSA for federal and state (California)","This year I decided to do my own tax filing and decided to use three filers to see which one was best. Overall, I'd say if used all three in tandem, you can actually learn a lot on how to self file in the future. I couldn't just use the simple free filers as I had a few forms that needs to be covered such as 1099-INT, 1099-Div, 1099-B, ESPP from work, HSA contributions, etc that were not part of the EZ File free form TurboTax offers.

Let's break them down.

**TurboTax**

This one is the simplest because TurboTax links to multiple brokerages and bank accounts to easily pull information over. TurboTax also assisted me in understanding how to calculate the adjusted basis cost for my ESPP so that I wouldn't get double taxed and understood how my HSA contributions was as my employer did not list my contributions in the W2 on Box 12. 

What fell short was that it made it too easy and it could have lost a few hundred bucks. When it imported my Vanguard information over, it took the summary of my 1099-B and entered that as an overall gain. However that was not the case. Credit Karma did not allow a summary entry and wanted me to enter everything itemized or I would not have caught it. The problem with just utilizing the 'Summary 1099-B' that TurboTax offered was that it doesn't determine what was short term vs long term as you're going to have to blanket it as one or the other. So if you do use TurboTax, confirm your 1099-B and make sure it's not using the summarized information or it could cause problems. Once I itemized each individual sell instead of using the summarized information, it worked out.

By the end of it all, TurboTax matched federal with FreeTaxUSA and Credit Karma. However, for state taxes for CA, it only matched FreeTaxUSA.

**FreeTaxUSA**

Simple to use and very meticulous. Requires a little more knowledge of adjustments especially with ESPP, but it does give you the option. It goes through EVERYTHING you could possibly deduct or get credit for. Similar to TurboTax, it allowed me to enter a summarized 1099-B, but after the fiasco with TurboTax, I decided to break it down individually. Cost a bit for state filing but there's coupon codes and eBates refunds for it. 

By the end, FreeTaxUSA matched federal with TurboTax and Credit Karma. However, for state taxes for CA, it only matched TurboTax

**Credit Karma**

Simple interface and allows both free Federal and State tax filing. However, this one requires a bit more knowledge and making sure the information is entered correctly. Unlike the other two, the 1099-B form does NOT offer summarized filing and is literally just a spreadsheet. For most, this isn't an issue as you would itemize everything instead of using the summarized information, but when it came for ESPP and trying to find the true adjusted cost basis, there was no assistance here whatsoever. 

Here's where utilizing three filers came into play. While the federal refund matched the other two filers, the state refund was much higher; about 2x higher. Credit Karma does allow you to print the actual tax forms at the end of the process to double check everything, but the interface itself did not assist in figuring out what went wrong. From the website's interface standpoint, the state information I entered matched exactly as FreeTaxUSA and TurboTax, but the return was still about 300$ over what the other two calculated. It was not until I pulled up the printable tax form was where I realized it did the California HSA taxation all wrong. California does not allow the exclusion of HSA contributions from state income, the amount is added back to the federal income for purposes of the state and then applies the deduction. Credit Karma did not do that and there was no way for me to fix it.

So overall, I'd say for my case, FreeTaxUSA works best for me; and especially for those in states where HSA contributions are not exempt. However if they are then Credit Karma works just fine. I would say to just double check to be safe. But after all this experience... holy hell filing taxes is quite easy for very basic stuff like this. I thought having multiple investment accounts would make it complicated, but even this was easy.",finance

worldpolitics,"TRUMP SIGNS IMMIGRATION BILL, THEN ROLLS IT UP AND STABS SUPPORTERS IN THE BACK WITH IT","The main promise of Donald Trump’s 2016’s presidential campaign, the gleaming white carnation on his tailored suit—“We’re going to build a wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it”—will never come true. On Friday, Trump made sure of it.

After a belligerent Friday morning press conference in which the president declared a state of emergency in order to allocate funds to build the wall, on Friday afternoon Trump signed an omnibus bill that ensured the wall would never be built. Not only that, the bill ensures the country will be flooded with more illegal aliens than ever.

Regarding the wall for which Trump had originally demanded $25 billion before backpedaling down to $5.6 billion, the bill doesn’t even deliver what the Democrats had agreed to, which was a puny $1.6 billion. It only allocates $1.375 billion—enough to build about 55 miles of bollard fencing rather than a concrete wall—and it limits construction strictly to the Rio Grande Valley section of the border. And even within that section, construction is prohibited on federal and state lands. Regarding the rest, it requires local authorities—which in South Texas are uniformly Democratic and largely controlled by Mexican drug cartels—to agree to the wall’s construction, which is like asking black people to agree that slavery benefited them. It will never happen.

Section 224(a) of the bill prohibits any illegal alien who is sponsoring an “unaccompanied” minor illegal…or who claims they may, you know, one day sponsor one…or who currently lives with an unaccompanied minor illegal…from being deported. This provides a massive incentive for illegal aliens currently bleeding the public coffers to call up minors from south of the border as little baby human shields against deportation.

The bill Trump signed also allocates a record $3.4 billion for refugee resettlement. It doubles the permissible number of unskilled seasonal workers who can apply for H-2B non-agricultural visas. It reduces the number of border detention beds by 18%. It adds $40 million to a program that moves asylum seekers from the border to the country’s interior, where they are almost always released.

personalfinance,Incoming college freshman on my own financially. I’m in desperate need of assistance!,"This August I’ll be starting college 2 states away from home with zero financial assistance from any family. I come from a single mother and nobody to be a safety net if things go south. Fortunately, through a scholarship, grant, and FAFSA, I’ve gotten my estimated annual tuition to around $12k per year for a total of 4 years, so we’re looking at an *estimated* $50k debt.

Now, the interest rate for the loans is 5.05% fixed (for the ‘18-‘19 year, it’s subject to change). Along with that, a 1.066% origination fee is deduced at disbursement of each installment of the loan. 

As for repayment, there’s a 6 month grace period and the repayment length ranges from 10 to 25 years with monthly payments (no less than $50 each payment).

For starters, I have little to no knowledge about how interest and fees work on such a large amounts of money, especially since the loans can be spread out over so much time. This isn’t something that they taught us in Financial Literacy at my high school, so any sort of explanation will be greatly appreciated.

Now that the big number questions are out of the way, I am also concerned about the petty cash and how I’ll survive on a day-to-day basis. 
As of now, I’m working about 20-25 hours a week at $10.75 an hour. I would work more, but school and extracurriculars get in the way of things. However, once school ends, I will be able to fit in plenty more hours. Maybe even close to 40 hours a week. 

What could I realistically live off of per week? Tuition along with room and board are all combined into the $50k total, so the only things I’d really have to worry about paying for are textbooks and gas. In theory, I’d hope to have a part-time job when I move, but that isn’t guaranteed and I’m not sure how many hours I’d get. I currently have a little under $1k saved and plan to work my ass off this summer to start with a somewhat comfortable amount. 

Does any of this sound even remotely close to a solid plan? I have little very knowledge with anything concerning finance, but I do have the capability of being extremely frugal after being raised by a single mother. I feel lost in the dark, especially with this multiple digit loan. I don’t want to be stuck in debt for the rest of my life, so I want to make sure I do this right. Any sort of feedback will be more than greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking time to read this.

I have a small mortgage loan with a balance of \~25k with a 6.49 interest rate for 30 years. I'm 9 years in. 

The original loan was something over 30k, and I was paying the minimum for a long time. As you can see, most of this went to interest. Now I'm in a position to pay more as needed. If I stick with minimum or even slightly higher payments, I'll have paid dramatically more than I ever borrowed.

What's the best way to pay this loan off? Should I refinance and get a lower interest rate (rates are much better today) or should I just pay extra to the principal?

personalfinance,To refinance and remove PMI -- or not?,"Hi all,

About two years ago I purchased a duplex for around $330k -- I live in half and rent out the other half, which covers approximately half of my monthly mortgage payment (\~$2500). In hindsight, I took out more loan than I would have liked at the time, and what I thought was a decent downpayment at the time turned out to be minimal because of the cost of this house vs. others I anticipated purchasing. Because of this I'm locked into PMI on an FHA loan for the life of the loan. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mortgage rate right now is 4.25%, which I'm not unhappy with. What does grind my gears is the PMI I pay, and because of the terms of the loan, the only option to lose it is to refinance. Last year this amounted to nearly $2500. The amount paid for PMI does help offset income from the property on taxes, though. Regardless, I'm in a much better financial position today vs. two years ago; I've paid down the mortgage to roughly $305k and I can pay down enough to not have PMI on the new refinance loan if I go that route. I do plan to hold onto this property for a number of years, even after I move out of my portion of the property. Refinance loans today through my current lender look like they're hovering around 4.5-4.6% APR. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there an easy way to compare the payment structure and long-term cost of refinancing and dropping PMI but having a higher interest rate, vs. keeping my current loan? To me at a cursory look, it just seems crazy to continue paying $2500 extra each year for a loan when it's not necessary, and my knee-jerk reaction is to think that, of course, the refinance at 4.6% is the better decision.

Should I try to pay off the loans in 1 year, and build a decent sized emergency fund ? Or should I wait 2 years to pay them off and have more money comfortably , interest rate should be 4.5%",finance
Bitcoin,"""Empirical evidence does not seem to warrant the claim that deflation impairs long-run growth"" - Jorg Guido Hulsmann","***DEFLATION - The Ethics of Money Production by Jorg Guido Hulsmann***

Still another variant of the same basic fallacy that we just discussed is the alleged need to fight deflation. The word “deflation” can be defined in various ways. According to the most widely accepted definition today, deflation is a sustained decrease of the price level. Older authors have often used the expression “deflation” to denote a decreasing money supply, and some contemporary authors use it to characterize a decrease of the inflation rate. All of these definitions are acceptable, depending on the purpose of the analysis. **None of them, however, lends itself to justifying an artificial increase of the money supply**. The harmful character of deflation is today one of the sacred dogmas of monetary policy. **The champions of the fight against deflation usually present six arguments to make their case**^14

1. One, in their eyes it is a matter of historical experience that deflation has negative repercussions on aggregate production and, therefore, on the standard of living. To explain this presumed historical record, they hold, 
1. Two, that deflation incites the market participants to postpone buying because they speculate on ever lower prices. Furthermore, they consider, 
1. Three, that a declining price level makes it more difficult to service debts contracted at a higher price level in the past. These difficulties threaten to entail, 
1. Four, a crisis within the banking industry and thus a dramatic curtailment of credit. 
1. Five, they claim that deflation in conjunction with “sticky prices” results in unemployment. And finally, 
1. Six, they consider that deflation might reduce nominal interest rates to such an extent that a monetary policy of “cheap money,” to stimulate employment and production, would no longer be possible, because the interest rate cannot be decreased below zero.

**However, theoretical and empirical evidence substantiating these claims is either weak or lacking altogether.**^15 

***First***, in historical fact, deflation has had no clear negative impact on aggregate production. Long-term decreases of the price level did not systematically correlate with lower growth rates than those that prevailed in comparable periods and/or countries with increasing price levels. Even if we focus on deflationary shocks emanating from the financial system, **empirical evidence does not seem to warrant the general claim that deflation impairs long-run growth**.^16 

***Second***, it is true that unexpectedly strong deflation can incite people to postpone purchase decisions. However, this does not by any sort of necessity slow down aggregate production. Notice that, in the presence of deflationary tendencies, purchase decisions in general, and consumption in particular, does not come to a halt. For one thing, human beings act under the “constraint of the stomach.” Even the most neurotic misers, who cherish saving a penny above anything else, must make a minimum of purchases just to survive the next day. And all others—that is, the great majority of the population— will by and large buy just as many consumers’ goods as they would have bought in a nondeflationary environment. Even though they expect prices to decline ever further, they will buy goods and services at some point because they prefer enjoying these goods and services sooner rather than later (economists call this “time preference”). In actual fact, then, consumption will slow down only marginally in a deflationary environment. **And this marginal reduction of consumer spending, far from impairing aggregate production, will rather tend to increase it**. The simple fact is that all resources that are not used for consumption are saved; that is, they are available for investment and thus help to extend production in those areas that previously were not profitable enough to warrant investment.

***Third***, it is correct that deflation—especially unanticipated deflation—makes it more difficult to service debts contracted at a higher price level in the past. In the case of a massive deflation shock, widespread bankruptcy might result. Such consequences are certainly deplorable from the standpoint of the individual entrepreneurs and capitalists who own the firms, factories, and other productive assets when the deflationary shock hits. However, from the aggregate (social) point of view, it does not matter who controls the existing resources. What matters from this overall point of view is that resources remain intact and be used. Now the important point is that deflation does not destroy these resources physically. It merely diminishes their monetary value, which is why their present owners go bankrupt. **Thus deflation by and large boils down to a redistribution of productive assets from old owners to new owners.** The net impact on production is likely to be zero.

***Fourth***, it is true that deflation more or less directly threatens the banking industry, because deflation makes it more difficult for bank customers to repay their debts and because widespread business failures are likely to have a direct negative impact on the liquidity of banks. However, for the same reasons that we just discussed, while this might be devastating for some banks, it is not so for society as a whole. **The crucial point is that bank credit does not create resources; it channels existing resources into other businesses than those which would have used them if these credits had not existed**. It follows that a curtailment of bank credit does not destroy any resources; it simply entails a different employment of human beings and of the available land, factories, streets, and so on. In the light of the preceding considerations it appears that the problems entailed by deflation are much less formidable than they are in the opinion of present-day monetary authorities. Deflation certainly has much disruptive potential. However, as will become even more obvious in the following chapters, it mainly threatens institutions that are responsible for inflationary increases of the money supply. It reduces the wealth of fractional-reserve banks, and their customers— debt-ridden governments, entrepreneurs, and consumers. But as we have argued, such destruction liberates the underlying physical resources for new employment. The destruction entailed by deflation is therefore often “creative destruction” in the Schumpeterian sense^18.

***Fifth***. In the past eighty years, the sticky-prices argument has played an important role in monetary debates. According to this argument, the manipulation of the money supply might be a suitable instrument to re-establish a lost equilibrium on certain markets, most notably on the labor market. Suppose that powerful labor unions push up nominal wage rates in all industries to such an extent that entrepreneurs can no longer profitably employ a great part of the workforce at these wages. The result is mass unemployment. But if it were possible to substantially increase the money supply, then the selling prices of the entrepreneurs might rise enough to allow for the reintegration of the unemployed workers into the division of labor. Now, the argument goes, under a gold or silver standard, this kind of policy is impossible for purely technical reasons because the money supply is inflexible. Only a paper money provides the technical wherewithal to implement pro-employment policies. Thus we have here a prima facie justification for suppressing the natural commodity monies and supporting a paper money standard.

This argument grew into prominence during the 1920s in Austria, Germany, the United Kingdom, and other countries. After World War II, it became something like a dogma of economic policy. But this does not alter the fact that it is sheer fallacy, and it is not even difficult to see the root of the fallacy. The argument is in fact premised on the notion that monetary policy makers can constantly outsmart the labor unions. The managers of the printing press can again and again surprise the labor-union leaders through another round of expansionist
monetary policy. Clearly, this is a silly assumption and in retrospect it is very astonishing that responsible men could ever have taken it seriously. The labor unions were not fooled. Faced with the reality of expansionist monetary policy, they eventually increased their wage demands to compensate for the declining purchasing power of money. **The result was stagflation—high unemployment plus inflation—a phenomenon that in the past thirty years has come to plague countries with strong labor unions such as France and Germany**.

***Sixth***. Another widespread fallacy is the idea that paper money could help to decrease the interest rate, thus promoting economic growth. If new paper tickets are printed and then first offered on the credit market, so the argument goes, the supply of credit is increased and as a consequence the price of credit—interest—declines. Cheap money is now available for businessmen all over the country. They will invest more than they otherwise would have invested, and therefore economic growth will be enhanced.

There are actually a good number of different fallacies involved in this argument, and it is impossible for us to deal with all of them here.^19 [...] In short, economic growth is diminished below the level it could otherwise have reached. To sum up, it is by no means sure that politically induced increases of the money supply will lead to a decrease of the interest rate below the level it would have reached in a free economy. The success of cheap-money policy is especially unlikely when the policy is not adopted on an ad-hoc basis, but turned into a guiding principle of economic policy. But the fundamental objection to this policy is that it is counterproductive even if it succeeds in decreasing the interest rate. **The consequence would be more waste and thus less growth**.

personalfinance,Best platform for investing in a Roth IRA?!,"Good morning [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance). I have a couple of questions in regards to IRAs. I have briefed myself on the basics of it but I was wondering if I could get some feedback from personal experiences.

I am 23 currently making a little over 50k a year. The only monthly fixed expenses I have include a phone bill, internet bill, and a couple of subscription services I pay for here and there. My car is paid off and my parents help with the insurance. I am currently attending college but I am paying that out of pocket and I have already set money aside for the upcoming semester. Also, no student debt.

I am leaning towards contributing to a Roth IRA but I am curious as to what you guys think would be the best route? I bank with BB&amp;T so that would be convenient for me to manage my finances but I have also researched Vanguard, Ally, and Fidelity. I am also taking advantage of my employers 401k and have that maxed out. My current investments in my 401k are VFIAX and LFIUX.

personalfinance,Rate of Return on Lump-Sum Mortgage Payment Toward Principal?,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to understanding the math behind allocating a one-time lump-sum payment toward my mortgage this year.

I'll preface this by saying:

1. We're getting little to no benefit from deducting our Mortgage interest from filing, since we're only slightly above the standard deduction this year by itemizing (26-27k range vs 24k std)
2. We already plan on maxing out 401ks, Roths, HSAs in 2019
3. In an ideal world, we would be selling our apartment by 2022-24

&amp;#x200B;

Mortgage details:

1. Purchased home 07/2017
2. Put about $150k down
3. Price of Apt (Co-op): $515k
4. Interest rate: 4.125%
5. Loan: $365k

&amp;#x200B;

**If we were to make a one time $100k payment in 03/2019 and sell by 07/2023 - about how much money would that payment have ended up saving us?**

&amp;#x200B;

Further Background: As we expand our family, we will be looking to eventually upgrade from a 1.5br apt --&gt; home, as such, we're hesitant to invest the money in the market (\~$100k), seeing as:

a) We'll need to access it for a purchase in a few years

b) While timing the market is generally a losing bet, a recession could be looming in the next few years.. (a lot of ""sources"" speculate Market returns to avg around \~ 5-5.5% in the next 10 years)

c) I'm pretty sure any money put toward our home will generate a greater return than say an Ally Online savings account @ 2.2%

&amp;#x200B;

My simple understanding is as follows:

We will lock in a REAL return of 4.125% if we put that money toward our mortgage --&gt; in other words, it would be the equivalent of a pre-tax market return of \~ 6%, considering our other option is investing this money into a brokerage account and our long term capital gains tax =

fed: 18.80% (15% + NIIT)

NY state: 6.58%

Local: 3.88% (we're from NYC\* and expect to maintain a combined income of \~ $300-400k annually, MFJ)

&amp;#x200B;

From the perspective of a pre-tax stock market return in the 6% range:

**Would we be saving about 6% annually?**

**In other words \~ $35,408 total return (before taxes), if we sell by 2023?**

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing anything obvious? It seems like it's a no-brainer putting this money toward the mortgage vs Online Savings or The Market (at this point).

&amp;#x200B;

All opinions welcome :)

personalfinance,I screwed up my taxes somewhere but I'm not sure exactly where. At what point do you hire a pro?,"Long story short, my income jumped fairly significantly this year (from about $85k to right at $100k).  Also I signed up for our companies ESPP and bought some stock.  Other than that, there were no major financial events in my life - no new house, no new kid, no new spouse, nada. I have some RSUs that I have always got that I sold as well.  I'm single w/no dependents.  Normally I get about $300-500 back from federal and state combined and call it a day.  I ran my taxes through FreeTaxUsa and it said I owed $1700 total.  This threw me so I doublechecked and ran them through TurboTax.  It said I owed $2200.  In a panic at this point I ran them through HR Block.  They claimed I owed $2700.  While I have the money sitting around in an emergency fund I'm at a complete loss as to how I got in this situation.  I went into my payroll site at work and changed my deductions from 5 to 3 which I'm hoping will defray the cost next year for sure.  

What I'm at a loss to explain is why the tax bill is so much higher ($2-3k depending on what numbers I run) than it was last year.   Is it because my overall income is $15k higher pushing me into a different tax bracket?  Is the ESPP income (buying stock at a 15% discount and selling it immediately) what did it?  Is it the tax code overhaul?  Is it something else I did wrong?  Is it worth calling in a CPA at this point?  I really don't want to pay someone $200-300 just to have them say, ""Yes, you owe $3k"".  That seems like rubbing salt in a wound to me.  I kind of just want to know what changed so drastically so maybe I can take steps this year to prevent it. 

Edit:  /u/TheCzar11 figured it out I think.  At the end of Jan my payroll department started withholding $280 instead of the $350 they were withholding before.  This meant I withheld $3500ish less than I did last year which makes the difference between a $600ish return and a $3000 tax bill.  Not happy with this explanation as it means I do indeed need to cut a check for $2-3k but it does make sense.",finance

personalfinance,Temporary PMI when Home Appraisal &gt;5.5% Loan Value?,"We are purchasing a house for $290k, but the appraisal came back at $306k. 

We were planning to pay 20% down to avoid PMI, but I'm debating paying 15% down instead and using the remaining $14.5k for renovations. 

The cost for PMI on this loan is $32.87/mo. 

Interest rate is 4.125-4.25% (depends on how much remaining seller-paid closing costs we have left to buy down the rate) for a conventional 30-year fixed mortgage. 

In theory (and unlikely), the lender could remove PMI the day after closing since we'd have &gt;20% equity in the home immediately, but they can't put anything in writing for a minimum duration of PMI.

Worst case, it should be about four years before PMI is required by law to be removed if we don't make any additional principal payments (78% of loan remaining). That's about $1,600 for an extra $15k loan, plus the additional interest on the higher financed amount.

Romney means Roman and both derive from the name Romulus who was considered a founder of Rome. Romulus was a founder and ancestor of the Kings of Alba just outside of Rome. The Colonna family claim to be the Julio-Claudian dynasty and they can be directly linked to the more recent Counts of Tusculum from Alban Hills. The Julia gens were from Alban Hills or Alba Longa. Saint Alban is known as a martyr in Britain during Roman rule around 300 AD and was an agent of the ruling families of Alban Hills. The Julia and Claudian families merged creating the name Julio-Claudian and often took the first name Julius. The Barons of Romney are a peerage in the United Kingdom in the county of Kent south of St. Albans. The head of the Romney peerage today is Julian Marsham the 8th Earl of Romney taking the name Julian similar to Julius. Julian's children are David Charles Marsham, Michael Julian Marsham, and Laura Clare Marsham. It was Henry Sydney the 1st Earl of Romney that invited the Dutch King William of Orange to take over the English Crown. The Romney nobles are landowners, conservative politicians, and members of the Royal Society. The British Peerage sent out family branches as agents into the United States to assist in maintaining control for the British Crown which works with Rome. This is why many towns in the United States are named after towns in the United Kingdom and why many powerful politicians and businessmen have the same last names as British Peers or other nobility. Romney is the name of a town in West Virginia established by the House of Burgesses. Mitt Romney established his Bain Capital in Boston. Boston is named after a district in Lincolnshire, United Kingdom. George Irby the 11th Baron Boston is the current noble of this district and he has political and business oversight in Boston, Massachusetts. Mitt's son Tagg Romney founded Solamere Capital a private investment firm. 

The Romney family are extremely powerful within the United States and are a founders of the Church of Latter Day Saints. The Matheson family is an influential Mormon bloodline involved in politics and law with Scott Matheson Jr. and Jim Matheson. The Huntsman family are another Mormon clan with Jon Huntsman Jr. as former Governor of Utah and the current Ambassador to Russia. They own the Huntsman Corporation which has assets estimated around 9 billion and the company is run by Peter R. Huntsman. The Pratt family are another influential Mormon family and intermarried with the Romney and Huntsman bloodlines. George W. Romney was the former Governor of Michigan and his son Scott Romney is a politician, Mormon Bishop and businessmen. The Romneys in Michigan are owners of the Highwaymen motorcycle gang which is headquartered in Michigan. Mitt Romney is a high level member of the Church of Mormon which is headed up by Church President Thomas Monson. Mitt Romney co-founded Bain Capital with Bill Bain which manages over 70 billion in assets. It was El Salvadorian and Latin American businessmen that used criminal profits in offshore accounts in Panama from gangs like MS13 and the Puerto Rican Mafia to invest in Bain Capital. Bain Capital finances MS13 and the Puerto Rican Mafia to carry out gang stalking for them. Prince Filippo Colonna the son of Prince Prospero Colonna di Paliano of Rome has worked for Bain and Company and Mitt Romney was its former CEO. Bane means curse and the Bane family are Scottish nobles. Mitt Romney is an arrogant tyrant that finances persecution or ""curses"" on others to build him self up. Joshua Bekenstein, John Connaughton, Jonathan Lavine, and Stephen Pagliuca are currently the top executives of Bain Capital. Harry Mason Reid is one of the most powerful Mormons as a former US Senator and wealthy businessmen. The motto of Utah is industry. The Mormon Bill Marriott is Chairman of Marriott International and worth about 2.2 billion as well as being a Mormon priest. His brother Richard Marriott is also worth about 2 billion. The Marriot family were London publishers and they are likely the ancestors of the American Marriott family. Richard Peery is a Mormon billionaire involved in real estate development. James Jannard is a Mormon worth about 3 billion who sold Oakley to Luxottica owned by Italian billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio and he is worth over 18 billion.

The founders of the Church of Latter Day Saints were Freemasons from New York including Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith who takes the name Hyrum from Hiram Abiff a character in Freemasonic legend as the architect of Solomon's Temple. Mormons call their utopia Zion and Mormons later founded Salt Lake City in Utah really named for the word utopia. Utah is the Mormon's Zion. The Colonna family used pillars or columns on their coat of arms. Colonna means column. Freemasons use pillars in their temples and there are columns at the Mormon Church in Washington DC. The Colonna family merged a family branch with the Barberini family. The Barberini family use bees on their coat of arms. Bees and beehives are the most common symbol used by the Church of Latter Day Saints and the beehive is also the emblem symbol for Utah. The initiated Mormons are Freemasons trained in deception and mind control. Willard Cleon Skousen was a co-founder of the Council for National Policy and he infiltrated the FBI for the Church of Mormon. His relative Joel Skousen works with Infowars and promotes apocalyptic themes. Infowars heavily promoted the Cliven Bundy psyop carried out by the Bundy family who are Mormons and Harry Reid to try and start a violent conflict with militias and federal agents. Infowars got a big upgrade soon after that. The wealthy Masonic-Mormons like Mitt Romney finance gang stalkers. The word Catholic means universal. The Mormon Church is secretly a branch of the Roman Catholic Church. Gary Herbert is a Mormon and the current Governor of Utah. The past 4 governors of Utah have been Mormons educated at Brigham Young. The Roman Empire follows the more ancient format of the Babylonian Empire and this is why the Conference Center for the Church of Latter Day Saints is designed just like the depictions of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Psalm 137 in the Old Testament states ""By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.""",finance
investing,Buying Gold and Mining Companies,"Hello all,

Please poke holes into my theory about the economy. The economy is fueled by low-interest rates and everything is consumed by borrowing as the country's saving rate is poor. This is evident by credit card debt increasing year after year. 

The Fed attempted to be hawkish by talking a strong game, but in the 4 quarter of last year after a small hike the market tanked and the Powell capitulated saying the Fed is more data dependent. Now, the market projects no rate hikes this year. And everytime the Fed meets and they don't rate hike gold will rise. The only asset class that is undervalued is mining companies and this is where I been parking my money as this is a play on the gold price. Now that Gold does not have to compete with higher interest rates gold will seem more appealing and the mining companies will benefit from this as their margins will be much better now that the price of gold is improving.  We will hit another recession again it's inevitable and when this happens what will the Fed do? They will rate cut again causing more inflation and gold does great in this environment. 

What other asset classes is undervalued in this economy? Everything is else is bid way up and It's hard to find value in this market. Yes, an argument can be made for emerging markets being undervalued as well, but in the US market what is cheap?  Nothing!!! Buying mining companies seem the smart play because they're cheap now.",finance

personalfinance,"I caught myself shopping for a new car (that I can't afford) because mine was ""worn out"".","I have a 2006 Honda Accord 4cyl that has 225,000 miles on it. I drive it to and from work every day (for 5 years) and it has been acting up on me lately. A tire leaks air, the brakes are bad, and I'm having troubles while accelerating. Not to mention my two toddlers have trashed the interior. I chalked it up to being time to buy an upgrade.


I started searching for cars online. I can get this 2016 for just $18,000! But I might as well go new for a lower interest rate. That's only $25,000 for a brand new car. I have about $2,000 budgeted for car repairs that I can add to trade-in value on my Accord and will come away with a super nice vehicle at a low monthly rate.


As I continued searching, I kept trying to fight reality. In actuality, I have the ability to fix every one of these issues, but my own laziness is attempting me to find the easy way out.


I got online and found new brake rotors and pads, air and oil filters, and spark plugs. I got my oil from a local mega-chain. In one day I plugged a tire (nail), changed my air filter, changed out the brakes, changed my oil, and changed my plugs. In total it may have cost me a hundred bucks and a weekend day. I also cleaned up all the trash and clothes, and vacuumed the car. I felt so accomplished when I was finished.


I swear, it feels like I'm driving a whole new car. Now looking back, it seems silly that I wanted to buy a new car just for convenience of not having to deal with preventative maintenance. Before you make a large purchase, take a step back and ask yourself if it's really necessary. I consider myself great with money but apparently very lazy as well haha.



Edit: Many posters have recommended other semi-DIY preventative maintenance jobs for older cars. Do these at your own risk. There should be plenty of instructional videos on YouTube. (In no particular order):

personalfinance,Need help understanding PF advice w/ Employer matched funds vs loan repayment,"So I'm in my first fleshed out job (salary, 401k, full benefits, 2 weeks vacation, etc.) out of college.  I have 3 months worth of all expenses in saving, and about 1k a month left over after everything is payed.  I have about 43k in private loans, so I searched ""loan repayment vs investment"", which brought up several results all saying getting rid of debt is a better ""return"" than investing.  However, the How to handle $ sticky says Employer matched are still better than debt repayment.

I guess I'm struggling to see how a 2% salary growth (50% of first 4) beats the 8.75%-10.5% interest rate of my loans unless a 401k return is much higher than I think it is.  

My company also offers a share purchase dollar for dollar match up to 3% of salary, which vests the next pay period (2 weeks) and is touted by several execs as ""free money"".  While I can see it would take the shares dropping to .49x of original price to lose money, even with a 9-10% growth historically, wouldn't my highest interest loans still cost me more than I would make?",finance
personalfinance,Wife doing grad school abroad,"Forgive me for the lengthy post—I could use some perspective on me and my wife's current situation.We both graduated from the same Graphic Design program with BFA's in 2017. Shortly after graduating, my wife applied to a Master's program at KABK in the Netherlands (also around the same time we got engaged). She eventually wants to teach design at the college level, so an MFA is required. The program is quite competitive with a class size around 10-15 students, so we weren't' sure she would be accepted. She ended up getting her acceptance notification in the spring of 2018

&amp;#x200B;

Things moved quickly after that. Our wedding was set for June 2018, and there was a lengthy list of tasks to complete before having to move abroad in July for the start of her program. Planning a wedding is no small feat, but we were also trying to figure out our savings, my visa, loans, and living arrangements. We fought constantly on whether or not it was possible in our timeframe (it wasn't). After many hard conversations between ourselves, friends, and family, she requested a year-long deferral that was eventually approved. It was great news since it gave us an extra year to save up and make arrangements, but as I expected, the year is passing by more quickly than I  hoped it would.

&amp;#x200B;

That brings us to now. We're both currently employed in our field with salaries of $33k and $38k—decent starting salaries for 23-year-old graphic designers, but nothing special. We don't currently have any debt, which is great, but we also don't have much in savings (probably around $10k combined). Both of our credit scores are upwards of 750. The cost of her tuition will only be $8k/year, but the school requires we also pay $10k upfront for cost-of-living expenses. They're supposed to give that money back to us after we open a Dutch bank account. I guess the reasoning is that they want to make sure we'll have enough to cover some of our rent, groceries, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So all in all, it looks like we'll be about $26k–$30k in debt by the time this is done. Her parents will be helping us with some of the costs, but we'll be paying them in return upon completion of the program (important to note that we can't get federal student loans because the school isn't recognized). We'll obviously have to leave our current jobs when moving abroad. This also means two years will go by with very little money being saved (or none at all).  Does grad school seem like a good investment to make in this instance? I want nothing more than for her to get closer to her career goals, but the idea of being in debt and not being able to prepare for our retirement early on concerns me. Is there anything we can do to prepare better? This might not be as big of a deal as I think it is—we just don't have experience with matters like this and don't want to make mistakes that could haunt us later on.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** My wife was accepted to a Master's program in the Netherlands last year but had to defer because we didn't have the funds to make it happen. We still don't have much money saved up, so we'll definitely take on debt. Is leaving our jobs and the ability to save money now worth it for potential career upgrades in the future? Are we hurting our chances of a flexible retirement by postponing our ability to save money? What should we be doing in the next 5-6 months to prepare?",finance
investing,Can someone good with figures tell me if this is as risk free as can be?,"- Ok, so I'm based in Ireland.

- Mortgage rates are currently 2.6% variable.

- Looking at a 2 bed apartment

- Loan of 180k

- Paying 3600 in rent a year 

- I am single.

My idea is that I buy an apartment. The spare room can be rented out I believe for at least 6000 a year (500 a month)

I have been doing the calculations and I believe that it's a sure fire way for me to make money on it. Even if house prices fell by 10% I'd still be in profit.

My idea is that I can have a tenant that is paying towards the mortgage. I would save money by not renting. 

I believe from my calculations I wouldn't just be saving on rent, I would be making money on it also. I have the file linked below. Please let me know what you think.

I have done the calculations on interest rates doubling and it's still feasible according to my figures. 

The only way I can see trouble (I wouldn't be making money on the house) is if house prices dropped by 10% or more and the interest rate doubled. 

BTW just in case law is different in the states, no capital gains tax on primary residence if sold and rental income for owner occupiers is tax free up to 14k a year.

personalfinance,"Trying to pay off all debt before the end of the year, but I owe a lot of money in taxes. In what order and size of payment should I pay all these down?","Back in April, I received a check for residuals for a commercial I did years ago (used to be an actor — don’t follow your dreams, people). While it was a nice windfall, the agency didn’t take out much federal tax and no state tax, so I knew I’d owe this year and put aside the appropriate amount of money (about $6,000) I paid down my credit card debt ($7,000) with the remainder and should have just invested or saved the rest in a separate account (about $3,000). Well, I didn’t.

I got a little into the “treat yo self” mentality after struggling for so long and ended up buying things I couldn’t really afford and being less ruthless with my budget, like purchasing a bed frame from CB2 or taking my friends up on an opportunity to an vacation with them to the Dominican Republic. Soon, I was back in the red and that amount saved for taxes dwindled to $1,000, and I knew I had messed up. Luckily, at the end of last year, I took a job where my income jumped from $87k to $113k, so I knew I could dig myself out of my debt relatively fast and even start saving towards a house. 

Tax season arrives and I do a pretty thorough itemized deduction. Then, I add that W-2 from that commercial and my taxes owed jumps to $4,200 federal and $1,900 state. I know it was gonna be bad, but it still hurt. 

So here’s a approximate breakdown of my debts and assets:

Debts

$6,100 - Taxes
$8,210 - Credit Card (18% interest with $11k limit) — started paying down $1,000 a month two months ago. Credit score currently at 710. 
$2,310 - Student Loan (11.5% interest)

Assets 

$1,000 - Savings
$1,500 - Current cash (getting paid on Friday - biweekly)
$800 - New 401k (currently contributing 15%)
$15,000 - Old 401k 
$8,400 - Rollover IRA
$240 - Really old 401k

Lifestyle background: No kids, not married. My workplace pays a significant amount for my benefits (i.e. insurance) I live in an expensive city, so my rent is high ($1,960 for a one-bedroom apartment that I share with my long-term boyfriend — he pays about $700 a month in rent, as he makes significantly less than I do), but I only pay for Internet and no other utilities. I cook at home often and don’t own a car. I workout at my office gym but pay a monthly subscription for Daily Burn for home workouts on weekends and holidays and Bodybuilding.com’s premium lifting guide. I’ve cut out coffee shop trips and try to stick to public transportation or walking as much as possible. My biggest monthly charges besides rent is my phone, which is $200 a month for paying down an iPhoneX I bought in June 2018 and unlimited data. 

So, after taking this into account, how do you guys think I should best tackle this? I know the IRS offers payment plans (as I have used them before), but states can be a bit trickier, so I may just have to eat that debt immediately. I’ve been considering ways to get around the high interest of the card, like getting a balance transfer card and paying it off quickly or a personal loan. Also, am I insane contributing so much to my 401k when there is debt to be paid? Should I reduce my contribution? Thanks in advance.

$70 for groceries

$150 for entertainment (drinks, eating out, movies, xbox live, Netflix etc)

$15 for gym

I haven't looked at insurance rates yet but I'm 30 with no tickets or accidents since I was 24. I would imagine it would be around $100-130 for full coverage.

worldpolitics,Banca D'Amerigo,"Amadeo Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in California which was later renamed the Bank of America. The Bank of America is still under the original charter of the Bank of Italy today. America was named after the Amerigo Vespucci a Florentine explorer financed by the Medici banking family. The BOfA is the second largest bank in the United States with assets estimated at 2.2 trillion. Amadeo Giannini was the son of Italian-Genoese immigrants and was financed by Genoese businessmen. Genoa was a powerful banking center in Europe for centuries. Wealthy banking families from Genoa include the Doria, Grimaldi, Spinola, Cattaneo-Della Volta, and Pallavicini families. Prince Andrea Cattaneo della Volta works in banking and the oil industry. The Pallavicini family are still bankers today with Prince Moroello Pallavicini and his brother Prince Sigieri Pallavicini and he has worked with Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, Prudential Financial and Lehman Brothers. The Pallavicinis own a investment firm today called Global Wealth Management. Merrill Lynch is a division of Bank of America. The Bank of Italy or now Bank of America made loans to the wine industry in California as well as to Walt Disney. Roy E Disney was a Vatican Knight of St Gregory. Giannini was a member of the Board of Directors for Columbus Savings &amp; Loan. The Doria family of Genoa financed Christopher Columbus. Amadeo Giannini also made loans to FIAT in Italy after WWII. John Elkann is Chairman for FIAT and married to Donna Lavinia Borromeo. Pierre Casiraghi is married to Beatrice Borromeo and his mother is Princess Caroline of Hanover and she is the daughter of Prince Rainier III of Monaco from the Genoese House of Grimaldi. The central bank of Italy is called the Bank of Italy. The Borromeo family were noble landowners, merchants, and bankers that did business in Venice and Florence. The first Director of the Italian Bank of Italy was Bonaldo Stringher who was from Venice. Luigi Einaudi was the third Director of the Bank of Italy and from Piedmont. The Borromeo family ruled right near Piedmont and still own islands in Lake Maggiore. Amadeo Giannini was really working for these north Italian bankers as a proxy to establish one of the largest banking institutions in the United States. The International Banking Act of 1978 was established right before the Bank of Italy or Bank of America went public on the Stock Exchange. Anne Finucane is the current vice-chairman of Bank of America. Brian Moynihan is the CEO of Bank of America and today they use this bank like a mafia to control other businesses through financial extortion. 

https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/giannini_hi.html

Amadeo Peter Giannini has been called ""America's banker."" His Italian father traveled home from the California gold fields, then brought a Genoese bride back to San Jose in mid-1869, via the brand-new transcontinental railroad. His mother was also an adventurous soul, leaving her family and homeland with a man she'd known for only six weeks. Their son Amadeo, born in San Jose in May, 1870, would take his own risks in the world of banking.

As a young man, Giannini succeeded in the wholesale produce business, but grew bored. Angered by the era's typical banking practices -- making loans to and servicing only wealthy clients -- he founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco in October 1904

After a disastrous earthquake and subsequent fires levelled much of the city in 1906, Giannini created new confidence. He set up a temporary bank immediately, collecting deposits, making loans, and proclaiming to all that San Francisco would rise from the ashes.

In 1928, Giannini put his banks into a giant holding company he called Transamerica Corporation, reflecting his new ambition. In 1930, he formed the Bank of America, which would eventually become the largest in the United States.

https://sites.google.com/site/kondabhaskarreddy/a-p-giannini-founder-of-bank-of-america

The International Banking Act of 1978 was the first legislation enacted in the U.S. to bring domestic branches of foreign banks operating in the U.S. into the framework of Federal banking regulation. Until then, foreign banks operating in the U.S. had been subject to various state laws with no unity nationally in how they were treated. This had given foreign banks both certain advantages and certain disadvantages compared to US banks. For example, foreign banks had the advantage of being able to branch interstate, but suffered in trying to attract retail deposits because they could not offer FDIC insurance.

My financial situation is good and I could definitely afford to pay an extra $50 a month for my loan.  I actually plan on paying an additional $200 monthly towards my loan regardless if I refinance.  

I am leaning hard to towards the 60 month refinance, but was looking for feedback to make sure that there is nothing wrong with refinancing 4 months into my loan.

Thanks for any and all advice!",finance
personalfinance,Trying to course correct the federal refund,"For the last two years, my wife and I have found ourselves owing federally.  Last year the state return managed to cover what we owed on the federal end.  This year, it did not.  

We each had brief secondary employers and made a total of $2082 from them, but the W2's showed neither took out federal taxes.  

I actually switched employers in the last year, so that has guided our thought process to her main employer not paying enough in (708 on 18451 made).  

Beyond that, we made 907 on debit interest and dividends.  Capital Gains netted $1535, stock sales made $89.  I have two Roths that I contribute monthly.

We have someone do the filing for us, so my hope is that there is not an error in the paperwork, but maybe something on the i9 to change?

Economics,What do people think of this economic philosophy I've created?,"This is part of a larger philosophical manifesto.

&amp;#x200B;

""An economic system that aligns with and harnesses the core nature of human existence and rejects destructiveness is needed for humanity to be on the path of building.   


This system would recognize the need for each individual to obtain power and would harness the individual will to obtain power, but it would involve rejecting excessiveness in extortion and hoarding. To combat excessive power seeking through hoarding, people in power must allow for the offloading of power in money and ownership to others that deserve it, along with consumers rejecting businesses run by excessive power-seekers. Power cannot be offloaded to those who do not deserve the power though. These are people who will relinquish all responsibility from themselves and will not work hard or work at all.   


All of this achieves a balance in the power spectrum, the key to building.   


The economic system I have created that strives for complete building is called Conscious Capitalism. It is beyond capitalism, and it is beyond any economic system ever devised in the history of mankind. It is beyond any system because it supersedes rigid structure and is based in personal choice, cooperation, and nuance. This economic system is individualism and collectivism intertwined in their strongest forms.   


Individuals must extract resources, create goods, and provide services for the continuation of the species. Individuals may either own the means of production and be compensated by consumers with money for what they provide, or individuals work for someone who owns the means of production as a means of production in exchange for money. The means of production are resources, equipment, and labor. The person who works for themself and provides only their labor has ownership of the means of production. If the person works for someone else it can be said that the employer owns the personâ€™s labor as a means of production and can direct the person as they please until the point where the worker chooses to leave.   


Ownership of resources and equipment is one thing; the individual must have the drive to turn those resources (knowledge may be a resource) and equipment into a good or service. Most of the drive comes from the compensation in money they will receive from consumers. An employee must also have the drive to work for someone else. Most of the drive to work for someone else comes from the compensation they receive from the employer. These drives are essential to action and creation. If a person does not have the drive or funds to start their own business, they must offer themselves as a means of production for someone else. As a means of production they simply have to complete their specific tasks and do not have to worry about running the entire organization or providing funds for it, but they do not get a share of the profits, they do not have any power, and the locus of power over their responsibilities and pay is with the owner. The owner is free to take advantage of the worker up to the point that the worker leaves the organization.   


When business owners hoard their power, the rest of the population is forced into a position of powerlessness in which they must offer themselves as only means of production because they do not have the access to resources or equipment, do not have the funds to acquire them, and it is difficult for them to create a business with little money because the established businesses use their power to increase productivity and out compete any newcomers. Those who are not the owners are driven into servitude and taken advantage of because the owner CAN take advantage of them, and because it is thought that they MUST in order to maximize profit. The imbalance created in hoarding is complete destructiveness. A life of servitude is a life that is not worth living. A person who feels that their life would be worth living if the system were different develops destructive tendencies because the system is so large and complex that a controlled deconstruction of the system is impossible for a lone person.   


Business owners must also be consumers, but since there is a small percentage of business owners and an extremely large percentage of people who are not, it can be said that the workers are also the consumers. Business owners may take advantage of the consumer, even more so when there is less competition in the field or if there is collusion in the field. Prices may be exorbitantly raised and profits do not go to the worker (consumer), it goes directly to the owners.   


Business owners, the controllers of operation, may abuse workers and they may also abuse the resources and the consumer. The owner may abuse the environment, abuse animals, and use practices that create a poor product, or even a harmful product. The consumer may be unaware of the treatment of workers, unaware of the abuse of resources, and unaware of the abuse they receive if the product they are given is deceptively poor or harmful. Businesses may be able to hide the destructiveness of the operation or product through advertising or by keeping their mouth shut. In most cases there are no repercussions for businesses that operate destructively.   


The best economy is one in which every individual is driven to contribute and build, and everyone enjoys their life. It is an economy that minimizes destructiveness and maximizes building.   


The individual may be in one of four roles in the economy, and in each of these roles they have the free will and choice to act either destructively or constructively. The owner, worker, consumer and government must work together in order to build.   


Conscious Capitalism and The Business Owner-   


It is up to the individual to create a business that is not destructive. The individual mind must understand that money maximization is not the goal. Building is the goal, and society as a whole must be included in this goal.   


In order to minimize destructiveness and maximize building, the business owner must take a small profit instead of seeking the maximization of profit for themself. The business owner should pay their workers their worth and should provide their services to consumers for a reasonable price, while keeping a small profit in compensation. With pure capitalism the owners of businesses instead desire to push wages down to the bare minimum amount required to keep an active labor force and price their services to consumers in a way to acquire the most profit possible. Pure capitalism rewards greed and excessive power-seeking. But as one individual obtains power at anotherâ€™s expense, the other person develops wrath or depression. An excessive power-seeker does not use their power to create more power in others, they hoard their power and wield it to obtain even more power. Yet if a business owner is not compensated for their risks in obtaining power and producing goods, they will become wrathful or depressed. A balance is needed.   


Individuals must desire and obtain power, but not too much power, and individuals who obtain power must disseminate the power to others. The dissemination of power must be done in an efficient manner that maintains productivity and does not interfere with the others' will to obtain power. Weakness is created if power is disseminated to those who do not deserve it or will squander it. The inefficient dissemination of power usually does not come from the business owners, but from the government seizing the power and distributing it to the masses. In order to disseminate power efficiently it must come from the owner directly to the worker, in the form of money, ownership and respect.   


If Conscious Capitalism is to work, the basis of the economy is the formation of respectful relationships. Without strong relationships, individuals are turned into interchangeable cogs and treated poorly. Without a respectful relationship with the world, people will neglect it and destroy it. The formation of relationships starts with the business owner. Workers must be treated with respect and not subjected to poor working conditions, or if they are, compensated fairly for them. A worker must be paid fairly, with sacrifice being made by the owner, and as you will see later, the consumer. Owners should strive to create a more enjoyable and fulfilling work experience. Workers should not be treated as cogs, performing simplified, degrading and monotonous tasks over and over. The worker should be involved in the creation of a product or service in an extensive role, and see the fruits of their labor. A more extensive role means more power is being granted to the person, so that person must step up to the challenge.   


The allocation of ownership is essential. Ownership means power and a share of the profits. Without the dissemination of ownership the imbalance of power becomes out of control. With regards to passing on a business, family is important, but always allocating ownership from one familial generation to the other is too simplistic. If a business remains a small entity that can be managed by a small family it makes sense to pass it on within the family. But if a business can support multiple families, then it is destructive to keep that business controlled by one family, reaping all of the profits.   


It is up to the business owner to not take advantage of consumers or the planet. Consumers may be swayed into buying destructive products. Advertisements influence these people into buying into their own ignorance. Destructive industries must be done away with.    


It is up to the business owner to keep their business on a small scale and not hoard all the power of the market or industry for themselves. A sacrifice must be made to allow other businesses to form. The focus should be on keeping a business local and if there is room for expansion an allocation of ownership to another person is necessary.   


Businesses must not operate for the sole sake of making money. This mentality creates a lot of the destructiveness within an economy. Businesses must be made in order to strengthen society and every individual within.   


When a business ceases to operate for the sole sake of making money, it may become less profitable and risk being out competed by businesses that do seek to maximize profit and cut cost, but we will see later how this is remedied with the choice of the consumer.   


Conscious Capitalism and The Worker-   


The worker must seek power and responsibility, and when allocated power the worker must wield that power with strength.   


In Conscious Capitalism the individual is responsible for obtaining their livelihood. A little help is provided by the government, which I will go into later. If an individual does not cultivate worth then they do not deserve power and money. Workers must seek to become entrepreneurial and must seek responsibility rather than shy away from it. If an individual does not want responsibility then they do not deserve any share of ownership and a cut of the profits.   


The individual must know his place in society and in the economy. People must be graceful and know their limitations, power placement, and limit their greed for power. People must know that contributing to the building and maintenance of society can be done in ways that are not as direct and are less fulfilling, but are still beneficial and necessary. People must find their piece in the puzzle of society and must seek work that contributes to building and truth seeking, no matter how far removed from it. People must know their place.   


The worker goes down the path of destruction if they become too greedy, jealous, or lazy.   


Conscious Capitalism and The Consumer-   


The consumer plays a major role in making Conscious Capitalism function. In the end, it is up to the conscious individual to choose to support either destructive businesses or businesses that strengthen society for all. A sacrifice must be made by the consumer in the form of paying a higher price in order to support businesses that do not operate destructively. In the end the payoff for supporting certain businesses (this is where nuance comes in) is far greater than the money saved in supporting a destructive business and economic system.   


A business that operates destructively exploits the worker, consumer, and Earth. The consumer may still feel it is necessary to play into the game of the exploitation of themselves because they believe there are no other options. The consumer may also be oblivious to their own exploitation. The consumer that does not care about the worker does not have any empathy, common sense, or understanding of what it takes to build society. The consumer who facilitates the exploitation of the worker is no better than the business owner that exploits. Consumers do not comprehend that they are also workers. It is in their best interest to support the actualization of other workers for the sake of the widespread benefits that come around to themselves.   


According to the doctrine of modern economics, with economies of scale, large corporations are able to cut costs and sell their products to consumers cheaper. Under the same doctrine, the consumer should buy the cheapest product and support the most efficient business to save money and in turn support a system that uses resources efficiently. Except common economics and economical thinking does not consider the larger picture. Unconscious consumers choose to support businesses in the component that is most visible, their ability to produce a product efficiently and cheaply. Yet this ability does not make the certain business the best choice. If a consumer supports the corporate economic structure, they are supporting their own indirect demise. They may get their goods cheaper, but they must also work for cheaper for the same corporations that control the economy. Large corporations are soulless- they have no concept of rejecting destructiveness and choosing building. Individuals become faceless cogs in the corporate machine and are treated that way.   


A strong overall economy is one in which the focus is on strengthening the smaller-scale economies of the communities within it by supporting small local businesses. This economy is also one in which money is not allocated to entities that extort and exploit. With a small-scale economy you have the opportunity to form relationships, keep a closer check on how the business operates, and trust in a local business run by people you can interact with. By supporting a small local business you are more likely to get a well-crafted product and you support the self-actualization of the workers and business owners who choose to operate in the way of building. By supporting the community economy, a person supports the communityâ€™s ability to be self-reliant, along with helping each individual in that community to become self-reliant. Self-reliance is incredibly important in the formation of a strong individual and for its practicality in strengthening communities against the turbulence of the larger world.   


Small businesses have a greater opportunity to allocate power to its workers more easily. Small businesses have a better opportunity to not extort the workers or consumers. Small businesses are less likely, by their nature or by their operation, to have less of an impact on the environment and on the aesthetic of the environment.   


With a small-scale local economy you keep the money local and in the hands of people you can trust and who do not exploit. By supporting large-scale corporations you give money to an entity that extracts money from one area and allocates excessive profits to people living elsewhere. There is less oversight in dealing with large corporations and less of an ability to influence their destructiveness. The destructiveness of a large corporation flourishes because each individual that contributes to the operation feels no accountability.   


The consumer must invest in small locally owned businesses. It is counterproductive to join into the corporate economic scheme by putting money into the status quo corporate stock market. The corporate status quo is status quo because it is pushed onto the masses and because it is the easiest and less risky way to make money. The individual must look at the origin of fast-money making and must look beyond quick profits. Special care must be made in choosing the right small local business to invest in because these businesses are less of a guaranteed money generator.   


In a system of capitalism, there cannot be an excessive artificial propping up of non-destructive businesses that do not operate effectively. There must be competition or else the use of resources is inefficient. The individual will to compete and produce efficiently must be preserved. It is also to the benefit of society that some industries simply will have to remain large-scale as well. In these industries there is less room for the self-actualization of workers and large-scale efficiency is highly practical. These businesses should be the last to be converted into smaller-scale counterparts, but there should still be focus in eliminating all destructiveness in operation and if necessary, scale. The conversion of industries to small-scale will not happen overnight.   


Conscious Capitalism and The Government-   


Individuals comprise and shape the government, which acts on the economy. The government is used to counteract the destructiveness of the economy. The use of the government to curb destructiveness is inefficient and even counterproductive.   


The government is inefficient in curbing human nature because it is up to the individual to choose for themself if they want to act destructively or not. Forcing someone to act a certain way grates against the individual and makes the individual desire to exercise their free will in defiance.   


Inequality and an imbalance of power is part of human nature and society. Pure socialism or communism rejects this nature and creates weakness and dependency. The concept of absolute allocation for equality may create weakness in the individual or society.   


The government should function as a limited cushion for individuals that need short-term help. Individuals that need help with providing for their sustenance should be provided with a very limited base sustenance, not salary, in order to keep a smoothly operating society while protecting against creating weak and dependent individuals. The government should partially tackle income inequality by instituting a modest scaled taxation with special emphasis on taxing the very rich.   


Government regulation of business operation should be minimized in areas that only function as red tape. In areas of regulation that truly reduce destructiveness the government should exercise nuance in keeping regulation against extreme destructiveness while instituting a slow minimization of regulation in other areas to make way for freedom as individuals awaken to the duality of human nature.   


As part of eliminating economic power inequalities, government employees, white collar or otherwise, should be paid one half, one third, or less of their current salaries and benefits depending on how exorbitant their salaries are. The government should not act as a corporation that extorts the population and allocates exorbitant salaries to workers of the government.   


A combination of efforts from consumers, workers, owners, and government is needed to eliminate usury and the corporate financial industry. A collective effort is also needed to balance the power spectrum in white-collar and blue-collar positions, in which power is heavily allocated to the white-collar side. A collective effort is needed in supporting masculine areas of work and in preserving masculinity in jobs rather than eliminating them with technology. Finally a collective effort is needed to reject the notion that the economy can function as a continual growth model.   


Usury is evil (wrathful and destructive) and must be eliminated. Very low interest rates are okay, but no interest is even better.   


People must not put their money into the corporate financial system and members of the corporate financial system must cease to operate. The corporate financial industry takes huge profits and allocates money to large corporations. The financial industry produces nothing of value, is full of greed and useless wastefulness, and actively destroys society. This is reflected in the personalities of those that comprise the industry- empty and soulless. People must stop giving money and power to Wall Street and the globalist corporate elite.   


Real work must be compensated, not paper-pushing uselessness. A hard physical labor position can be considered more fulfilling than the office life, but it is incorrect to say that because of this, office jockeys should be compensated more. A hard physical labor position and a white-collar office job are difficult in very different ways, one for subjecting the body (and mind) to physical hardship, the other subjecting the mind (and body) to spiritual hardship. A masculine man would need to be paid far more to get him to do an office job, but for the large percentage of people an office job is much more appealing than doing strenuous physical labor. Should an office full of women be paid more than a work yard full of men? Many office jobs are actually not that soul-crushing and are partially fulfilling anyways. Women seem to be able to thrive in cushy office environments, although I believe this is a negative adaptation and superficial for even them.   


Work should be compensated for its real value and for what it takes for people to want to do the job. Useless paper pushers should not be compensated far more than a blue-collar worker simply because it is less desirable of a job. It is a job that should be completely eradicated anyways. Less desirable does not mean compensated more than every other job, although it does play a factor. But in our society it does not seem that office jobs are compensated more for their undesirability but because people actually think they are of more value holistically. I say that a man should be paid justly for the true worth and amount of physical and mental work he does and I say men should be incentivized to work with their hands by offering good pay for physical work. Power to those who deserve power, not for the positions that have manipulated, maneuvered, and propagated to obtain their fraudulent standing.   


An effort must be made to supersede the inevitability of technology supplanting all work, and especially masculine areas of work. This must be done through all four roles in the economy. Similarly, the specialization of work must be done away with. Specialization leads to monotonous and simplified drudgery, not self-actualization or societal actualization. A person should seek to become competent in many areas of work and enjoy the satisfaction of the diversification and higher complexity of work. People should not strive to become a specialist in one task and should not have to rely on an army of specialists to complete all their tasks for them. I envision society being comprised of agrarian communities that are created and maintained by a close-knit group of people competent in many areas working for one another in mutual benefit, rather than isolated people pushing off tasks to unknown specialists in an industrialized wasteland.   


There needs to be a growing respect and support of the masculine worker and builder. Craftsmanship needs to be brought back and supported. A craftsman self-actualizes and is fulfilled by his work. The same goes for women that practice a craft. There is a sense of power and accomplishment in this kind of work. There must be a societal push on all fronts in bringing back small-scale craftsmanship, one area being that consumers must seek it out.   


Our technological corporate economic structure leads to the breakdown of the polar nature in man and woman. Our economic structure feminizes men and masculinizes women. An agrarian-like limited technological economic structure allows for women to work in feminine areas of home-work and land-work (homekeeping) and craftsmanship, and allows for men to work in masculine areas of home-work and land-work (husbandry) and craftsmanship.   


I will end the section on economics by saying that the idea of constant growth is impossible and destructive because we live on a planet of limited resources and many people. The common economic doctrine of continual economic growth must be discarded for an economy that is sustainable and on the path of building.""",finance

personalfinance,Trading in a vehicle only 15 months old?,"So my husband and I have a BIG whoops. We’re accidentally pregnant with a third kid after we decided we were done. In November 2017 I bought a brand new 2018 Honda CRV after selling my 2007 Jetta to my sister. I love this car and the room for two kids. The problem is with a third kid on the way, it’s not going to be a great situation. From everything I’ve read online it may be possible to fit 3 car seats, but we’re going to have to buy 3 new ones and it’s going to be a very, very tight fit. My oldest is on the small side and will probably be in a car seat for at least another 1-2 years and will then go to a booster, so there is really not a way around the car seat situation. 

Currently my car loan is 1.99% and I owe approximately $20k. It’s in great condition and has about 17k miles on it. My thought is we probably need a minivan for the space and comfort of the kids. I am debating on trading in our current CRV for a new or used van or buying new car seats to see how long we can tough it out. 

New car seat cost (necessary to be a slim design to fit and may still not work) = approx $900 - $1000

Used car option - would likely still owe money on CRV car loan, borrow at higher interest rate for used vehicle. Lower vehicle cost. 

New car option - would likely still owe money on loan for CRV. Would have a better interest rate with new car and safer options for newer model but higher vehicle cost. May last longer. 

What am I not considering here? Has anybody been in this situation? I’ve never had to think about selling a basically still newish car I still owe money on. I’m also trying to aggressively pay off debt and save...

TL;DR I need to decide whether to keep my CRV or buy a new/used van due to third kid on the way and what makes financial sense.",finance

Forex,The Forex Indicator Number One!,"Hello folk,

I wanted to share my biggest experience on how to trade the forex market. 

I got to know that the smart money is in the yield market. Everything what happens in world shows the yield market. And there is one rule for  currencies and their strength. 

“Currencies follow yields/ interest rate”

It’s simple and you have to repeat this sentence hundreds of times in your mind. Currencies follow yields, since the interest rate tells you how worth the money is. It’s the only measurement for money. That’s what the central banks tell you, how much worth is the currency. 

Now you might ask “You want me to wait for interest rate decisions of the central banks?” 
No! I’m telling you, read what the bond market is telling you. How is the 10years Treasury Yield moving? How is the shape of the Yield Curve and where is it going? It tells you about the economy conditions (in this case the USA) and most important the inflation. Every country has bonds they sell to get loan. In Europe you take an eye on Germany, France and Italy since they are the most strongest countries in Europe. 

“So you are telling me, checking the yield curve tells me about how much worth the money is, the economy conditions and most important the inflation?” Yes!!

“What is the Yield Curve and how to understand the spread between US 10y and Japan 10y yields?”

Well, this takes to much to explain. I can tell you this: Spread between 2 Yields from different countries tells you where the currency pair will go! 
You can learn about the Yield Curve a lot in the internet.

I can recommend you: Read everything you can find about yields, yield curve, yield market, yield predictions, economic influence in bond yields and all the working papers which you can find in the internet about the yield curve. And if you are really smart, make an excel sheet out of it and trade the currency market like a pro.

investing,ive been running a non-registered investment fund. what might happen to me?,"so i have a ""fund"" or whatever you want to call it. with about 100 investors.  i record all the money that goes in and out. so far about 2 million dollars has come in. ive paid out 200k to people who took out their money. and the actual money in the fund is about 25 million. so ive grown 2 million into 25 million. i did this in 3 years

so pretty much... i guess im ""really good at stocks"" (but i guess im also cheating because im not paying taxes and im reinvesting the IRS's money) . the reason the fund grew so fast is word of mouth because i was so good that everyone starting telling their friends about me and how much money they were making, and before i knew it my phone was blowing up with people telling me they wanted to invest. 

i kinda just have just been ""going with it"" for 3 years... ive kinda had the mindset of ""fuck it, yolo, im not a bad guy, so i believe the system will protect me if things start going down. because the system is designed to stop the bad guys and protect the good guys. im not scamming anyone. im not a bad guy. im a good guy. so ima just go with it and hustle and win, and deal with issues as they present itself""

so umm... yeah... im now 3 years into ths and... ive gotten no phone calls, no FBI investigators coming to me yet. i expected it to happen by now. and i planned to just tell them (when they come) ""yo. im a good guy. not a bad guy. all my investors have made money. this isnt a ponzi scheme. i simply didnt registor because the laws are all so confusing and shit that i said fuck it. thats the total truth. do whatever you have to do, i am not mad at you at all for you doing your job. you have to do your job, and if the feds try to send me to prison i plan to simply tell a jury of my peers that i didnt fraud or scam anyone, i told all my investors that im not registered so the government might come in and shut it down, and they all still said yes to investing because they know how much money everyone else was making, and all i did was make money for my investors, and if thats a crime, then fuck it, i guess im guilty""

anyway... so umm.. what do you guys think might happen to me?

im in too deep now to quit... im just going life on total yolo mode i guess... whatever happens happens... fuck it

ive been basically living like a hermit / monk and living on less than 2000 dollars a month, making sure i take as little money out for me as possible, so when i do go to court i can show the jury that i basically have been living in poverty for 3 years  working my ass off helping all of my clients make millions while i make nothing, so how am i a bad guy?

also i didnt pay any taxes because the tax laws are so confusing, and im not registered... so i didnt know what to do... so i just didnt even file any tax returns whatsoever. thats one reason why the fund has grown so much, because im just reinvesting money that probably should be going to the government. but i made sure not to take any of the money for myself (and im not counting the tax money as gains for my investors either. im giving my investors only a fraction of their gains to make sure theres way more than enough money to pay the IRS when the IRS comes for me). so all the moneys all there in the fund, i made sure to keep all the money there so when the IRS does come for the money i can say ""yep, its all here baby. heres your millions. i didnt take it. i reinvested it for you and i grew it into fuckloads more cash. so really you should be thanking me because i just made you tons of extra money. i was saving it to give it to you when you come for it because the tax laws are just way too complicated for me to understand or follow. so because im too stupid to even do that shit, i decided to just hold your money until you come for it"". and my thought process there is... when that day comes and i give millions to the IRS... im hoping the act of me giving them extra millions will make them not care or give a fuck (hopefully)...  

the way im viewing it is... ive heard that filing taxes wrong is illegal. but simply not filing isnt illegal. so the government can come for their money whenever they want and tell me what they think i owe them. and ill give it to them.. and fuck it i dont care... i view the system as so retardedly bloated that its almost impossible to follow all these bullshit regulation laws properly... so fuck it... ima just yolo life and tell the world to suck my dick. so i figured i may as well keep and grow all that IRS money in the fund so when they come for it and i give them all that cash... they probably will be happy at the end of the day",finance

personalfinance,"The story of a young, dumb couple 10k in debt. Long and detailed information inside in the hopes of getting as much help as possible. Thanks in advance.","We are a 24yo married couple in Canada. We don’t have kids have always hoped to have 2 kids before we turn 30. To be honest, one of the main reasons we haven’t started TTC is because of our financial situation.

We are both college-educated and employed with no student debt, and with a total, monthly after-deduction (tax, health insurance, etc) income of $4250. Also, my husband is in a part-time graduate program on top of working full-time, and the program is fully funded by his employer (he is in a good field with high earning potential down the road).

We are currently $10k in debt due to total irresponsibility on our part. We bought a house and had a big wedding and honeymoon last year and came up short in both despite years of careful saving. We deserve the lectures on this but you can’t tell me anything that would make me feel any worse than I already do. This keeps me up at night and makes me feel sick every time I think about it, which is about a dozen times a day. Please know that I understand that this is a massive problem.

The debt is all currently on a line of credit with an interest rate of 4.45% for 2.5 more years when it drastically increases. I am very grateful it is not on a high interest CC but we obviously need it paid off before the low interest period is up and hopefully much sooner.

We have no savings – retirement, emergency or otherwise. Husband has a few thousand dollars in some sort of pension at work but it can’t be accessed unless he leaves his job. We had been building up an emergency fund but it seemed better to allocate the money towards the debt pile so that's what we did.

I am looking for some help critiquing our budget and some guidance about how to move forward.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are our monthly fixed, recurring expenses:

**HOUSEHOLD COSTS** ($2335 total)

* Mortgage – 1240
* Property tax– 410 (this is normally 260 and will go back to this amount in the summer – long story but can explain if necessary)
* Home insurance – 72
* Home internet and security system – 135 (100 in internet, 35 in home security)
* Electricity bill – 180 (equal monthly payment plan through the power company – we already freeze nearly to death all winter so I don’t think there is much room for improvement here).
* Cell phone – 48
* Groceries – 250 (this isn’t really a fixed expense but I have historically spent too much on food considering it is just the two of us and I am trying to stick to this amount as an absolute maximum. Food is expensive where we live and we like to eat healthy but I am working on trimming this down).

Also, We had a major kitchen appliance die last year and bought a new one at a furniture store with no payments due until June. We plan to put this on our line of credit in June when it comes due.

&amp;#x200B;

**TRANSPORTATION COSTS** ($592 total)

* Car payment – 142 (5-year-old mid-range sedan with $7500 left owing – we were definitely taken for a ride on this (pun intended) but our previous paid-off cars died, and we don’t have access to public transit so we need a car with a cheap payment and rushed in. We share it and carpool to work together. We would love a cheap second car but we know our financial situation doesn’t allow for one.)
* Car insurance – 225 (this is the lowest rate we could find due to driving history, we’re hoping to see it decrease this year)
* Gas – 225 (long commutes and extra driving due to the shared car)

**PET CARE** ($245 total – I know this seems high to most but this is cut *WAY* down from what we used to spend on our two large breed dogs and this is the only thing besides the mortgage that is non-negotiable. These dogs are my life and caring for them is my joy and main hobby.)

* Dog sitting services – 88 (necessary due to work schedules)
* Pet health insurance – 75 (I couldn’t sleep before at night before we had this because I can’t put a price on our dogs’ lives and I knew a big vet bill would ruin us. This is a good plan with a good, reputable company that provides me huge peace of mind)
* Dog food – 90 (we used to buy high-end boutique brands but have gone with a mid-range brand of food and am not willing to spend less than this, and it would be hard to do because we have 2 large breed dogs that eat a lot).

&amp;#x200B;

And here are our monthly non-fixed expenses:

* **PERSONAL SPENDING/POCKET MONEY** – 325 total for both of us that covers misc toiletries, takeout, etc. I know this is really high but we have a lot of trouble with self-control in this area.
* **ENTERTAINMENT** – 50 (this would be a “treat” outing, something like going to a movie or something once a month)
* **GYM MEMBERSHIPS/FITNESS PROGRAMS** – 80 (this is in total for both of us and is important to our health – we are both overweight and finally found something that worked for us so I would be hesitant to cut this but it can probably be reduced)

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, some annual/subscription expenses averaged over a year for simplicity:

* Amazon Prime – 8/month
* Spotify – 10/month
* Premium health app subscription – 7/month

I am willing to cut all of those except Amazon Prime because I think that pays for itself for us. All 3 together are $25/month.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In total, our expenses add up to $3652. This means we should have \~$570 left to pay off our debts each month but each month we end up overspending (I guess) due to poor discipline. This puts us at paying off our debts in about 1.5-2 years but we just seem to get further in the hole each month.

My question is, where can we improve? Should we be saving or should we rely on the LOC for emergencies if need be? How will we ever be able to have kids????

Any tips or constructive criticism welcome (except regarding the dogs)….thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,"Royally screwed up taxes by missing W2, not sure what to do","So i filed with turbotax. Turbo tax normally imports my W2's from my employers. I was able to efile without a problem. However, after efiling, i realized that one of the w2's wasn't accounted for. Basically, my income was under reported by like 40k because that W2 was missing. Im honestly surprised this didn't get caught by turbotax but of course its on me for trying to rush through my taxes.  My tax refund was pretty substantial, but given my income is much higher than that was was in my filing maybe I owe money.  I only have standard deductions, I don't own property, I don't have an income other than w2, i don't have any investment income or other real deductions. 

I understand that there is a 1040x amended return that i need to file, and I also need to file an amendment to my state taxes. Luckily in New York, I can file the amendment online.

How screwed am I? I am likely to be audited now?  The federal refund is estimated to be processed in like 3 weeks, should I wait until then to mail in a 1040x form? Should I hire a CPA? Is there software or apps i can use to prepare the 1040x?",finance

personalfinance,Looking for tips to help spending impulse control,"So here's the deal.  Growing up, my parents made a lot of poor financial choices, and I was determined not the make the same mistakes, but I never actually learned HOW not to make the same mistakes.  I started off strong, but now as a 29 year-old, I'm in quiet a bit of debt due to impulse control.  Over the years I've learned quiet a bit about finances, and now I mostly know what decisions are smart, what steps I should take, etc, but my problem is I seem to have no impulse control.  If I have money, I spend it.  Whether it's money that's been in my savings, or credit that's become available on a credit card from a recent payment.  No matter what I try, it doesn't seem to help.  I've tried taping up my cards to make it difficult to use, but I eventually use them.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my current situation- 

\-I just had to get a newish car because my old one died, so I have a new $15k car loan.

\-I'm finishing up my degree and have had to take out federal student loans.  Because of the ways things worked out, I should be able to finish school with less than $20k in student loans

I'm less concerned about those since it doesn't necessarily affect my every day spending.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm much more concerned about my credit Cards-

Card #1 \~$4500 currently cut up, but due to a personal issue and not always being able to work as many hours as I need, this card info is saved on a profile for one small bill, so I occasionally still use it for that.

Card #2 $0 -  I JUST paid off the $1750 balance with my tax return.  I still physically have this card, and will be using it on a trip at the end of March, but I shouldn't need more than $700 and hope to be able to leave the rest unused and cut up the card after my trip

Card# 3 $1500- this card is cut up, but the mobile app allows access to all the info to use it (which is the same case as #2 as well)

Card #4 $400 - this card is cut up

Card #5- $300 - this card is cut up, but the billing statements includes the whole card/account number, so I still have access to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I could be making a lot more progress with paying down my debt and building a savings, if I didn't spend any ""extra"" money I have (even when it isn't extra, when I have it set aside for a specific purpose, but then I determine I get paid again before that purpose is needed, etc).  The biggest culprit is take out/eating out because 1. I have severe depression, and sometimes taking care of myself, like eating properly, is impossible  2. I HATE cooking  3. I SUCK at cooking.  It's just so much easier to get food on my way home, but of course that's expensive.  Even when I'm good and buy groceries to keep at home, I'll still just get take out.  Another culprit is just generally buying stuff.  It's not exactly worthless or useless stuff, but it's also not necessarily a necessity, or at least not an immediate one.

&amp;#x200B;

I try, I really really do.  I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips they've found useful.  I thought about trying to get a CD or something as a savings so that I COULDN'T spend it, but the ones offered at the two banks I have accounts with, with need at least either $250 or $500 which I don't generally have at one time.

personalfinance,Wage Penalty payment,"Last year I worked for an employer, who fired me and then decided not to ever pay me my final wages. I filed claims with the department of labor as well as California, which has a pretty heavy wage penalty.

My employer paid me my claim to the amount of $2082.00 once they realized they weren't going to win at the hearing.

They sent me a 1099 with this amount in box 7, nonemployee compensation. I did some googling and I believe that this should have been in box 3 as other income because this was for a wage settlement penalty payment and not as a payment for services.

More googling I found that the wage penalties shouldn't be federally taxed. (Something something they're damages? I don't know.) Putting the income in box 7 leads it to be federally taxed on TurboTax tax (as my refund drops).

How should I handle this? Put it in box 3 where I believe it should have rightfully been and let my shitty ex employer deal with it? Contact them and make them change it?

Clarity Update: $2082 is the claim (penalty) amount only. I emailed my former boss and he was spooked into paying me my final wages beforehand which were reported on my w2 from him already.

gaming,I'm going to go ahead and say this about the Nintendo switch,"I think it's the most revolutionary console since the NES.

When we first heard about the switch, we scoffed and said ""Nintendo won't last.""  Then we saw Doom on the switch, then we saw high end graphics.  To top it off the Switch has the best Mario and Zelda games on the device since the N64 days.

But here's why I think the switch is a revolutionary step forward.  The switch is not only a console, it's a handheld, a portable console, a device you can unhook two joycons with and play Mario kart at the park.

It seems that Nintendo showed us of what's to come for gaming.  In the next 10 years, graphics are going to reach their zenith, and the consoles that power them are going to get smaller.

Imagine a PS6 that's designed similar to the switch with photorealistic graphics that you're streaming to your smart tv in 2030.

There's also another deciding factor.  Game development is getting out of hand, with some staff at Rockstar working 100 hours a week.  That model of making Video games is not sustainable.

Now granted Rockstar at this point can get away with making one big open world game every console generation, the whole idea of the AAA market surviving in the form it's moving is not viable.

Nintendo reminded the whole entire industry who is the champ of gaming.  The idea that I can play Doom on the go is the reason why I think Nintendo is onto something when it comes to the future of gaming.",technology

personalfinance,Should I make car payments or pay off the loan entirely?,"Hey /r/personalfinance!

I recently bought a car which was much needed to get to work. I just graduated college, moved to a new city and got a new job (60k/yr), so I needed to buy a car to get to and from work.

At the time of purchase, I had just too little cash to buy the car outright, so I had to finance. The car costs $11,700 out the door. I was told by the car salesman that it would be best to start off with $2,500 down even though I told him I had more I could put down. He told me that it was better to do $2,500 because after a certain point, it is considered a personal loan (whatever that means). Being young and my first time at a dealership, I listened. The salesman also told me that there is no early payment penalty for finishing the loan early. 

I financed $9,200 at an 11.89% interest rate over 72 months. The first payment is not due until 4/4/19 (1.5 months from now). By the time the first payment is due, I will have enough money to fully pay off the car and cover my regular monthly expenses. 

I am wondering if it is better to pay off the car loan in full on the first payment, or to pay the first few months to build my credit? My credit is at a good score, but I have little history (as I'm so young). I lean towards paying off the car fully on the first payment so that I can avoid any interest payments (the first payments accrue the most interest). Also, I hate the concept of being in debt. Will paying it off immediately hurt my credit? Is it worth paying the interest to build credit? If I make all of the payments, I will be paying an extra $3,800 on the interest alone. I don't want to pay more than I have to, just to build credit. 

My second though would be to pay the loan over 3-4 months, each payment being 1/3 to 1/4 of the total loan. This way I pay only an extra $300-$400 (in interest) to potentially build my credit. 

Any thoughts or opinions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",finance

I have about $23k to pay in principle to get to 80% of home value to get rid of PMI. Interest rate is 4.5%. Student loans are 13k at 6.55%. I want to be a bit more aggressive with payments, and can do about $300-500 extra each month (on top of mortgage and student loan minimum)

A lot of what I read says to make extra house payments first. I'm on standard repayment for student loans. I would like to make a spreadsheet or something to figure out the numbers but I'm not sure what info I need.

personalfinance,Regarding 1098-T forms for students - I haven't gotten one,"I'm a junior at a university in the US. I still have not received my 1098-T form for the 2018 tax year (and my mom's been grilling me about it). I checked my online student portal and can pull up my 2016 and 2017 forms, but the 2018 form is not there. I went to my school's Bursar Office and asked about it this past Thursday and was told ""we'll be sending them out this week or so"".

But uhh... isn't there a federal deadline for sending out these forms? Or am I going crazy??? I can easily find ""2018 deadline for educational institutions sending form 1098-T to students: January 31st (postmarked)"" when I google, and similar for 2017, 2016, etc. However, I cannot find any results for the 2019 (or really for the 2018 tax year).

personalfinance,New SALT law impact on tax returns,"For those of you living high-tax states, how bad has the SALT hurt? A lot of reports are saying people in states like NY, CA etc are paying much much higher tax liability than they used too. Is it really supposed to be that bad, because from what I read it should only hurt people who are very wealthy.

I get the reason behind the salt deduction cap at 10k is because an unlimited deduction of salt on your federal income means the IRS misses out on collecting revenue from high earners; which is in effect removing a federal subsidy of people living and working in high-tax states.",finance
personalfinance,How to best save $250 a paycheck?,"I am a 20 year old in college and I have recently gotten a minimum wage job. I work part time and get about $400 for my biweekly pay check. I have recently decided to save 250 from each paycheck for the next two years which is when I graduate. I pretty much have my college payed for and no other outstanding debts to pay for. This 250 a paycheck is money I can just save. I am wondering what are some good options for saving my money. I have a Robinhood account but I am hesitant to be putting that much into my account.  I realize the higher risk of investing yeilds higher return but I'm not sure if this is the way to go or if I should look into opening a savings account with an online bank like Ally to get better interest rates while being safer. My goal is to save money for after college for a down payment on a house. I want to best use this opportunity while time is on my side any advice would be great. Thanks!

# Jamie Dimon and Bitcoin

JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon is well known for his hatred of Bitcoin and love for the blockchain. It is understandable that he does not really have any clue what Bitcoin was created for or where its inherent value comes from. In a clip from 2017 at the Institute of International Finance seen [HERE](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/13/jamie-dimon-says-people-who-buy-bitcoin-are-stupid.html).  Jamie Dimon was cautioning people saying bitcoin will one day hurt them, that bitcoin has no value, that blockchain is amazing and he loved it. Its really odd that a man would have such a hate for bitcoin and it was also clear that he did not understand the cash he values so highly loses 2-3% per year from inflation.

## Inflation of currencies

To put that last statement into perspective, the USD loses between 2-3 cents of inherent value each year. This means if you leave money in the bank the last 5 years your 1 USD from 5 years ago is now worth only $.90. Yes that actually is true and how inflation works, but with bitcoin if you had bought a dollar in 2013 at say around $100 BTC your 1% of the BTC today would be worth over 35USD today. This is because Bitcoin's price is based on supply and demand economics and it is deflationary.

Deflationary currencies unlike inflationary ones cannot print an unlimited supply which is actually what causes inflation. If you have 100 USD  in circulation and print off more that 100USD actually loses value. This is why so many people say things like the Federal Reserve needs to end. It is because the printing of the USD, has since its inception caused the currency to lose approximately 95% of its original value and decoupling from Gold made the inflation more like hyper inflation without anyone noticing.

When I was a child the same chocolate bar that now is 2 USD was $0.50 and I am only 33 years old. So in around 25 years the inflation has caused that chocolate bar to increase 4X in price. Now why is this an issue? Lets look at things like minimum wage, what we see is that has not even come close to rising as much as inflation. This actually causes the Rich-Poor gap to increase as it becomes hard and harder for the average citizens to survive. When we look at Jamie Dimon the reason he does not care is because he is the 1% or the 0.01% so to him inflation does not affect anything. People at that level of society can afford inflation, because they have money to invest.

📷

## Impact on the average family

Lets look at the normal family and how inflation affects them. First things cost more actually everything costs more: Education, Insurance, Food, Water, Heating, Electricity, Gas, and the list can go on and on. If your income does not match the inflation in society each year you are at a company you actually are making less. The average family used to have more of a nest egg to invest, but with the global financial crisis of 2008 most have not recovered and sorry to say it but the markets look ripe to drop hard again in 2019/2020.

If we do have another recession or worse a global financial crisis, we will see people start to flock towards bitcoin as the government will quantitatively ease and print off billions. Doing so will not really help long term and end up with more debt in society and honestly for many the struggle is real, especially those in the United States and we have seen this time and time again.

## JPM Coin and Stablecoins

To wrap this all into the JPM coin and stablecoins in general they are a short term solution. For now they let us store our value pegged to the USD, and potentially in JPM coins case let the banks transfer USD to each other. The Inherent problems around fiat currencies is that they are losing value constantly and are backed by nothing but a government. Stablecoins for now let us hold the USD value of our cryptocurrencies and are a good hedge in the volatile market. What we all need to understand here is Fiat currencies like Venezuelan Bolivars, and the Argentine Peso have been far more volatile and hyper inflation has hit them hard. The thing everyone is missing is when this eventually hits the USD and it already is showing it has on an economic scale what will everyone turn to?

With deflationary currencies the solution is already here. For example BTC has 21 million coins that will ever make it into circulation at the time of this article there are 17,542,112 BTC with approximately 4M lost forever. As demand for BTC grows as it has in Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina and Turkey it will be a greater store of value. It will actually increase in price as you cannot make more and this is why John McAfee, Tom Lee and Tim Draper amongst others have put such a huge value per coin in the future of $150,000 to 1 Million USD.

📷

We all need to realize is Stablecoins are not the future, they aren't the solution. When the USD does meet its fate of hyper inflation as other currencies have, we will see cryptos like Bitcoin be the the world standard. JPM and USDT won't matter when the USD is similar to Bolivars and Argentine Pesos and this is what the future looks like. We cannot put a time on when this will happen, but when it does it is likely Bitcoin will be seen as a world currency. Bitcoin will back all currencies someday and this is why stablecoins are just a bandaid solution for the short term.

Sorry JPM coin, USDT, USDC etc... You are only a for the short term, it is time to see why Deflationary Currencies are the future!

deeplearning,"How is the state/memory variable's length (h,a or s) in a RNN specified?","Hello everyone, 

We know that in RNN there is a state that is responsible for keeping track of the information concerning the fed sequence.

In notations, some write them as *a*, some write them as *s*, and some others write them as *h* .

How do we specify their length ? 

Are they bound to be 1 dimensional ? or can they have any arbitrary dimensions ? 

for example for text processing where the input sequnce is a sentence, I have seen they specify the a, as 100 for example and define it like this : 

`a = np.zeros(shape = (batch, length, number_of_time_steps)`

&amp;#x200B;

is it corroloated with the number of time steps? or any value can be used? 

in case we have images as input, or any image like input at every time step, Do we use a 2D *a* ? 

Is it any difference in GRU/LSTM or are they all the same in this regard ( by that I mean, GRU has this variable, but also it has another one usually called *c*  and LSTM also has similar situation) 

&amp;#x200B;

I would be grateful if anyone could explain this for me. 

Thanks in advance",technology

personalfinance,Should I payoff my car?,"I am financing a 2016 Hyundai Accent (4 year plan to payoff). I make the payments with no problem, I even put about 90 bucks on it so I can pay it off sooner. But it has come to the point where I just want to be done with it. 

Honestly I am kinda just drooling over the money I could keep for myself not having this bill.

So the payoff amount is $6800. I can do that and still have enough for rainy days. Are there any reasons that I am not considering that would compel me to not pay my car off?

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you all.

EDIT:
The payoff amount is now $6400 (if that matters to anyone).

With everyone asking me for the interest rate, I realized that I don't remember the exact number. My APR is 18.68% but I also saw that there is a Daily Interest Accrual. This sounds strange to me. I called and they said depending on the day I make my payment the amount owed varies (before the due date of course). Is this normal?

personalfinance,"Rent-to-Own Family Home, Specific Situation","Hello,

I have a situation that is kind of niche so it's hard for me to figure out my options. 

I am about 6-months in to a 10-year rent-to-own lease on my home. It is a cheap home that I've been fixing up, a $15,000 note. I make payments every month, and the terms of the lease state that when the 10-year term is up, I will be allowed to buy the house. The account will be credited with enough money to cover the cost of the home. In summary, when the 10 years is up, I'm given the house. My rent payments are like equity.

The reason that it's like this is because the home is owned by my grandmother's estate. She originally bought the house for my sister, but she did not take very good care of it and ended up moving out a few months in without making payments. But I digress.

I jumped on the opportunity for a cheap house close to my parents and have been renovating it since. The only thing I'm worried about is the rent-to-own. Since it's a family agreement I really have my doubts that I'll be getting screwed anywhere, it still just makes me feel weird that I'm sinking a lot of money into this house and it's not technically mine.

Should I just ride out the 10 years, or should I try to get a loan to convert this to a traditional mortgage? It does have an interest rate, 2%, which is only because the estate (or the bank, or some entity I don't remember) had a minimum amount required. The house was basically a gift for my sister. 

I was concerned that because of the low cost of the house I may not even get a loan to buy it out. I'm not sure if this is the right path because I'm basically paying the hassle (and probably higher interest rates, although fairly negligible) just for a difference contract on my house.

I can provide more specifics if necessary. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,To pay off or not to payoff...,"My wife and I are of differing opinions on the subject of paying off my vehicle. Our payment on my 2016 Escalade is $608 per month. We have about 4 1/2 years left on the loan. 

The reason she is against paying it off is our interest rate is 1.9 percent so the actual cost of the loan is minimal. I am just of the mindset that you shouldn’t carry the debt if you don’t have to. 

She believes that at this interest rate the money is better off in a savings account. 

What is the consensus here? I’m honestly just curious as to which mindset most people have in this situation. I know the money works out close to the same either way.",finance
personalfinance,Concerned about taxes after not adjusting withholding last year,"Hi all,

The results of this tax season have been all over the place. Some who got minor refunds got screwed at filing to pay huge tax bills instead. Others saw a minor drop while still others saw huge increases. I'm not sure what the pattern is, so I'm concerned that our usual refund of $4000+ is in jeopardy. Any idea where I might find myself before I head into my tax preparer? I'd like to just be aware and consider changing my withholding if it's too harsh. Some numbers:

&amp;#x200B;

Income increased about $8k last year, but I make under $100k. 

I claim 4 exemptions on my w4, but overall tend to claim 5 on my return (me and my spouse, plus three children). 

No additional withholding beyond this. 

Federal tax withheld was about $1400 less than last year. 

Itemizations last year were around $14k, so it's likely I'll be taking the standard $24k deduction this year.",finance
personalfinance,What is the best investment strategy for me?,"Hey everyone! Thanks so much for being an informative and supportive community. First post here. I am 32 years old. I am a Canadian citizen, I live in the United States, and I am in the Optional Practical Training phase of an F1 visa right now (completed my PhD \~2 years ago, F1 visa expires in December 2019). My wife and I were married last spring and we started the green card application in October 2018.

I'm happy with the financial progress I've made since I graduated. I've paid off some debt, bought some toys, and now I'd like to create a plan and prepare for the future. What I'm really looking for is advice on the best options available to me given my immigration status and plans to continue to live and work here once the green card process is complete. My wife recently graduated and is starting a small business with a partner. Her income will be relatively low and unpredictable for the foreseeable future, so we'd like to come up with a plan using just my income for now.

**Income is as follows:**

Employer 1: $10,000 per month salary plus health insurance, 2+ years employed at this rate, 1099-MISC, stable income, 90% confident I'll work with this client through the end of 2019.

Employer 2: Approx. $7,500 per month, contract work, have worked with employer for 3 months, 50% confident I'll work with this client through this summer, 30% confident I'll work with this client through the end of 2019.

**Cash and assets are as follows:**

\- $41,500 in a checking account.

\- $3,800 in cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP).

\- 1 physical oz of gold (value of \~$1,300).

\- 1x April 18, 2019 SPY $262 call (value of \~$1,760; TD Ameritrade).

\- 0.3 acres of land in a city; appraised at $30,000; tax is about $350 per year.

\- Car (value of \~$20,000)

**Debt is as follows**:

\- $7,500 student loan, 6% interest rate, $200 monthly payments.

\- $18,500 car loan, 0.9% interest rate, $550 monthly payments.

\- No other debts, all credit cards, etc paid off.

**Bills are as follows**:

\- About $4,000/month in rent ($1,500), car payment, insurance, utilities, cell phone, subscriptions, food, and entertainment.

\- About $5,000/month in estimated tax payments.

I'm open to considering all strategies, including incorporating as some kind of entity (like an LLC, can I do that if I'm on an F1 visa?) or contributing to a Roth IRA (can/should I do that on an F1 visa)? Anything is appreciated. Thanks in advance :)",finance
personalfinance,Recommendation for what to fill out for W4?,"As I started doing my taxes recently, I realized I left allowance and withhold amount for my W4 for my new job at 0, which left me having to pay a hefty amount for the federal tax to make up for it.

personalfinance,When married but filing separately how important is it for the lower earner to file max deductions,"This has been a point of contention for 2 years with my future ex wife. Together we made over 100k this year. She works at a hospital and gets over time on occasion. I work a salaried position at $19/hr.  

She gets paid biweekly and I get paid weekly. She claims max deduction and then claims a dependent at the end of the year and gets a crazy refund. I claim 1 because my check is the one that keeps the wheels turning on our weekly expenses. Since her check goes mostly to monthly expenses. 

I figure in the end the ledger gets balanced. I owe less than $700 at the end of the year as opposed to giving the fed a free loan. Which would come out of her refund which is padded by max deductions and the dependant. 

Am I really losing money by not paying extra during the year? Or is it a wash at the end? 

At this point I owe for last year and she won't help. Even tho I have no personal savings because my check goes directly towards weekly expenses and into the monthly budget.",finance

personalfinance,Trying to understand why average tax returns are lower this year,"Just read this article: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/19/i-owe-how-much-americans-are-shocked-by-the-impact-of-trumps-tax-law.html

With the new tax law in place, the majority of people's effective tax rates will decrease.  Despite that fact, the average size of tax payers tax returns are lower this year.  Myself included, as I actually owe taxes for the first time.

I understand I've been getting larger take-home pay throughout the year, which I actually prefer, and my taxes owed is not a huge number, but I'm still curious.

Were the tax withholding schedules provided by the US government not good estimates?  It seems like payroll has been withholding less, comparative to previous years, but i.  Obviously the first year in a new tax code makes it very difficult to put together an accurate tax withholding schedule, but I just wanted to see if others agree that this is why tax returns have been lower.

Disclaimer: I completely understand tax returns aren't just free paychecks from the government, it's the government returning your overpaid tax, which you theoretically should have had all along.  Regardless, having an unexpected bill is never fun. 

Disclaimer #2: I know we still have a ways to go before tax season is over and official stats like the ones mentioned in the article can really be used, but many people like myself did not adjust our W4 exemptions, but we still swung from getting a ~$2k return (state + federal) to owing $2k in taxes (state + federal).",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off the rest of my car?,"I owe about $10200 left on my car. I've been paying $279 a month at a 2% interest rate. I have enough money in my accounts to pay it all off now, but it'll leave me with $7000 left. The only other debt I have is my student loan which I have about $28000 left at 6% with my monthly at $367. 

I really want to buy a condo or a house in the next 4-8 years and was wondering if I should just keep the auto loan and save the money to go towards a downpayment for a condo/house. Unfortunately, I live in Hawaii so a 2 bedroom condo is like $500k+ and houses are around $800k+. 

The hit on my credit score from paying off a loan is also unappealing. I'm at 772 so it probably will still be decent if I do take a hit, but that 800 is so cloooose. I know, unnecessary, but it's a silly goal of mine. Not super important.",finance
personalfinance,Paying insurance monthly or a one-time payment for 6months on a credit card,"I know I shouldn't carry a balance on my cards and I normally don't. I use them for rewards points and such. I mainly just have a math question as I'm not sure what would be cheaper overall, paying my insurance monthly or getting a discount by paying in full on my credit card and carrying over part of the cost for a month and how my interest charges would be calculated for that time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly would be a starting payment of $207.38 and five payments of $205.38 or $1234.28 for the six months.

A one-time payment would be $1204.25, saving me $30.03. I'd pay $700 this month so I'd only be paying interest on the remaining \~500

According to my Chase Freedom Unlimited card I have 17.24% variable interest rate calculated using the Daily Balance Method. If I understand this correctly I'd be paying 30 days worth of interest at 0.004723... per day. Over 30 days carrying 504.25 I'd have to pay $7.14 in interest which would be a net positive correct?

personalfinance,What's the best way to handle taxes when it comes to selling individual stocks?,"To make a long story short, for the first time this year I sold some individual stocks I was holding. These were all from a previous company I worked for. Some of them were purchased through an ESPP program and others were granted to be as part of a bonus. The company did well and the stock jumped up so I decided to cash out a portion of these stocks at a couple points throughout 2018. 

Most of these transactions were long term but I did screw up and one of them was a short term holding transaction. Of course I knew I'd owe taxes on them so I squirreled away most of the money and decided to deal with it come tax season. 

Welp...it's tax season! And I owe about 3000 bucks to the federal government. I can cover this cost and obviously it's too late to do anything about 2018, but I was wondering if there is a better way to deal with this in the future. Can I pay these taxes upfront at the point I sell them? Is it best to just calculate the taxes I'll owe the following April and make sure I set that amount aside until I do my taxes for the year? 

I ask because I still hold stock with this company and I'll most likely be selling more of it in the coming months.",finance
personalfinance,Selling new vehicle for older to consolidate debt??,"Looking into selling/trading in my current vehicle to get an older model to save money, lower my debt, and allocate money to other debt with higher interest (student loans, credit card).

I currently own a 2016 Tacoma Offroad 4 door w/ manual transmission, \~61k miles.  I currently owe $22,832.48 at a 3.74% interest rate, minimum payments are $400/month.  KBB trade-in value is $23,911-$26,178 (avg $25,045), private party value is $26,667-$29,182 (avg. $27,925).

What do I need to consider?,"I know traditionally cosigning on vehicles is frowned upon by this sub, but we are in a steady 6-year relationship planning our wedding. She is not going to bail on the loan (barring disaster). My Credit Score is 815 while hers is hovering around 600, so I want to be involved so that we can get a lower interest rate, but I also want her to be involved so that she can work on building her credit.

Some details:  Both of our cars are paid off; 2009 Kia Rio and 2011 Mercury Mariner Hybrid. I have always abided by ""drive it till the wheels fall off,"" but the Kia Rio is literally falling apart. We can't quite afford to pay cash outright for a vehicle right now, but we are looking at financing a 2014 Nissan Rogue for about 10k.  We will likely get $500-1000 on her trade-in (not much, but I just want them to take it off our hands), and we will likely put $1k down.

Also, I guess our other option would be for me to finance the car entirely on my credit and have her pay me. I really would rather her put it in her name, at least partially.  I'm just not familiar with co-signing on loans and wanted to know if there is anything I should consider.

EDIT: I just want to be clear. We are in this together in a long-term relationship and trust each other entirely. I really am not looking at whether or not we SHOULD do this, more about HOW to do this. What is the best FINANCIAL decision.",finance
personalfinance,What is considered a good interest rate on a personal loan?,"A few years ago I was in bad credit card debt. My credit score wasn’t too bad at the time, around 650, but I wanted to get ahold of my finances before it got really bad. I consolidated a few credit cards totaling around $5,000 into one single personal loan that was giving me 11% APR, and consolidated two other cards totaling $9,000 onto one card with a balance transfer, which was offering me 8% APR on the lifetime of the transferred balance. The interest rate on the cards was all between 20-24% APR before I consolidated them, so I definitely saved some money by doing that. 

Now, I have finished paying off the personal loan, and along with a few other financial moves, my credit score has risen a good amount, to 731. 

I can continue paying off the larger debt that is currently on the 8% balance transfer card, but I was curious if anyone knows if I would be better off getting another personal loan for that? Do you think I could get an interest rate below 8% or should I just be happy with what I have and knock down this debt as fast as possible?",finance

personalfinance,Advice: Sell or keep vacation rental,"Hello PF! My wife and I could use your opinions. We are leaning one way but would like your opinions :)

A few years ago, my wife and I bought a small studio in a west-coast ski town. The purpose was for that we could use it a few weekends each winter and summer. We really planned on using it when we had kids because its a the base of beginner ski hill and there are a lot of great summer camps for kids. We could afford all the expenses but ultimately hoped that listing it on Airbnb would cover most/all expenses (property tax/HOAs/etc)

Anyways, both my wife and I had some injuries that prevented us from doing anything outdoors (and using the property for the intended purpose). Also, my parents liked the studio's location so much that they bought there own (bigger and nicer) property 1 mile from our place. Their place is open for us to use anytime. Therefore, our place has turned into a full time vacation rental.
The Airbnb revenue is split: 50% winter (Thanksgiving-Easter), 40% summer (Memorial day-Labor Day), 5% spring (Easter-Memorial Day), 5% fall (Labor Day - Thanksgiving)

I probably spend 1-2 hours a week managing the place on Airbnb. Last year, we made $3k more than every expense. We bought the place for about $85k (no mortgage), it could probably sell for $110k.....

so PF: should we keep it or sell it?

About our finances:
We bought a house to live in last year and have a decent mortgage. Our budget includes all expenses and putting money away each month for future vacations and a car (different accounts). We both fund our 401k a little more than our company matches. We have a 3-4 month emergency fund. We are increasing this by renting a room in our house

What we could do with the proceeds:
1) immediately make our emergency fund to 6 months
2) planning on refinancing our mortgage (interest rates are lower than last year). May pay off some of the mortgage
3) use it as as a down payment for a condo close to where we live and rent it
4) invest it

TL;DR: We own a property worth $110k. We wanted to use it and then put it on Airbnb when we were not using it. We don't personally use it anymore. After expenses, it made an extra $3k last year. Should we keep or sell it?",finance

Although I have no work experience, I am incredibly motivated to being the best at whatever task I am given and in turn, doing my part in making whatever business I am working for the best it can be as well. My goal in any job I have is to keep customers coming back and being proud to do their business at my location. I have no problem starting off smaller, however I am looking to pursue a career in the finance field along with a finance degree and would like to find a job with a highly respected company such as those I have listed. Should I continue trying at these more lucrative conpanies, or should I aim for less desired companies to start out with?",finance

Edit:  

Thanks for all the advice guys, I see a lot of comments regarding the IRA account earning 2.2%, so I figured I'd a few more details. It's a Roth IRA through Ally Bank which was advertised to earn 2.2%, you can read more about it [here](https://www.ally.com/bank/ira/online-savings-account/). Digging deeper, it looks like it's actually just another saving accounts with IRA benefits. Luckily I'm not too deep into it financially, so I can move to a better strategy.

This update promotes:

\-Teamwork:, they lowered the Critical Strike cap to 50%. Now it's actually going to need you and your team to cooperate because your damage was basically nerfed for over 50%.

\-Autofill: Now, autofill in Neverwinter was a mess. The tank class GF (Now called Fighter) had a way to play it DPS. So people with DPS GF were put into random queues as tanks and the party had 0 Tanks, 4 DPS and 1 Support. And if that support happened to be a troll DPS OP, the party couldn't do anything. Now, every paragon path has a distinct role, so trying to get autofilled as a Tank with a DPS build no longer works, because you can't play DPS on a Tank Paragon Path.

\-New players: With the new caps and removal of Power Points, every new player will be able to slot the new ability in the moment they get it, rather than waiting levels for it to actually be good.

\-Will to continue playing: It's not my place to say it, but the already-maxed out players may finally experience minor struggle in end-game dungeons and trials. With your DPS halved, you'll struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for the personal opinion, I am very happy with these changes. Going out with my true feelings, I'll say that there are almost no more good game developers out there, kind of like in Arc Games. But they had the courage, to indirectly tell us ""We've screwed up, we're reworking the problems."" They know the game is going to have problems and they're trying to fix it. They know they screwed up and they dare to say it. They dared to say their product was, kind of shit.",technology

personalfinance,"Signed contract at Car dealership for used car. Contract terms have been modified, what can I do?","Hi everyone, 

Crossposting from r/LegalAdviceCanada in order to get more exposure.

I live in Quebec and am currently purchasing a used car in Ontario.

A  few weeks ago I went to a car dealership in Ontario to test-drive a  used car. It drove perfectly and I was very pleased with it. I went back  to the dealership and decided to pursue the purchase and start the  process. I sat down with a car salesman and started dealing the price.  He waived the Administration fees (499$) and the ""obligatory"" care  package (399$). Unfortunately the manager would not budge on the asking  price. So I accepted the price and asked to lower the interest rate for  the financing. They lowered it by 0.5%. Cool... not much, but cool.

I  then walked into the finance managers office in order to get financial  paperwork started. I signed a few documents including the price and term  agreement for the financing and gave a 500$ deposit. Then they asked If  I was going to be trading-in my old car or putting a down payment, I  said maybe, depending on the price they would offer for my used car.  Unfortunately I did not have my car with me at the time and couldn't  have them check the VIN to give me a price. So I waited until the next  morning to send this info. Nonetheless the salesman was Out of Office  that Friday... Damn it.

The  following Monday I get an email from the finance manager saying that he  wasn't able to lock down the requested financing term with the bank and  that he needed to modify the contract. I said that I agreed over  e-mails (never signed the new contract), but was still waiting on the  response for the trade-in value of my car. A few moments later, I get an  email from the salesman saying that they could only offer an amount  that was much lower than what I expected. I never gave him a response  and decided I would think things through.

Now  at this point I'm already a little pissed that they had to modify the  original contract, but still went on with my day. Whatever.

Fast  forward to today, and then I get a new e-mail from the salesman saying  that the car needs winter tires for the Quebec Safety inspection. I had  not planned for this. I am caught off guard and begin to stress a lot  over this. I do a bit of research and find out that I can use my old  winter tires from my old car for this new car (same bolt pattern, but  different tire size). So I get back to the salesman and tell him this,  but then he says that I'll have to pay fees for wheel balancing and  installation. I flip out. I'm pissed. I tell him I can change the tires  myself in less than 10 minutes and that I don't need their services. (I  personally despise garages and dealerships and do all my mechanical work  myself.)

So, now I'm pissed, anxious and displeased by the entirety of this car purchase and just want to pull-out.

What  are my options? Can I break the contract that I signed? Will I get my  500$ deposit back? I'm scared and confused and really don't know what to  do.

Thanks.",finance

Last year I filed my taxes and it turns out I owed about $2000 federal/state combined. I thought it was because of my job transition (FT job started out as PT), so I expected to get something out of my return this year... I just put in both my W2s and it turns out I owe over $3000 this year! 

I don't understand why I owe so much money and why it isn't being taken out during the year in small increments. Last year I consented to a payment plan for the IRS. Do I have to do this every year? Why is my income being taxed so much? Am I filing wrong, or are my employers doing something wrong?

I make $115k/year and have great job security. I have $110k in my 401k, which has been high volatility the past year (about even over the last 18 months). 

Should I take out a $50k loan from my 401k (paid back over 2-3 years @ 6.5% interest which goes back into the 401k) and pay off my student loans? The origination fee is about $100 and the quarterly maintenance shouldn't be too bad I hope. I figure it would be realizing a 5% gain as I'd be paying the interest back to myself instead of a loan company. The only issue would be if I lost my job as I'd have to pay back the loan within 30 days. I have no savings other than a three month emergency fund.

All of her profits went back to those same moneylenders as she had to borrow at interest rates of 10% a day. Lack of access to capital and financial services has locked hundreds of millions of the most vulnerable in poverty. Many have touted microcredit as an intervention that can pull these people out of poverty, but it is unclear how effective it is in fighting poverty. Today's podcast will be exploring the effect of microcredit on global poverty, focusing on the success of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, the microcredit financial crisis of India, and an examination of the empirical evidence on microcredit.

Muhammad Yunnus, winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, began his career as banker to the poor in the village of [Jobra](https://www.economist.com/media/globalexecutive/banker_to_the_poor_yunus_e.pdf), Bangadesh. He was inspired by the story of Sufiya Begum to make small loans to [42 women](https://www.economist.com/media/globalexecutive/banker_to_the_poor_yunus_e.pdf). To his surprise, all 42 women paid back their loans. Banks showed little interest in adopting Muhammad Yunus's idea, so in [1983 ](http://grameen%20bank%2C%20microcredit%20and%20millennium%20development%20goals/)Muhammad Yunus created the Grameen Bank. The Grameen Bank's model centered on organizing groups of poor women. Each individual in a group is mandated to save small amounts of money everyday, and receives financial coaching from Grameen Bank employees. Average loans are [small ](http://www.grameen.com/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/GB-2015_33.pdf)around $170, and generally intended for small business creation. While loans are made to individual members, liability for loans are share at the village level among groups of groups. The microlending relies upon social pressure by group members and the fact most members have few borrowing choices beyond microcredit to ensure extremely high levels of [repayment](https://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/reswkpap/pdf/rwp10-11.pdf), Microcredit has grown at a spectacular rate in Bangladesh. [Approximately ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314243671_Microfinance_Market_in_Bangladesh)25 million Bangladeshis, about one seventh of the population, borrow $5 billion from microredit financial institutes every year, and microcredit has been credited for [one tenth](http://www.ifpri.org/blog/how-microfinance-has-reduced-rural-poverty-bangladesh) of poverty reduction in rural Bangladesh.

The initial  success of micro-credit in Bangladesh led to it's rapid expansion. However, as is the case in Andhra Pradesh, India, the result was overexpansion. Vikram Akula, a long time admirer of  the Grameen Bank,  founded SKS Microcredit in 1995, quickly turning it into one of the regions largest microcredit lenders. Akula argued that microcredit needed to attract private, [profit seeking](http://www.informaticsjournals.com/index.php/jbt/article/viewFile/21237/17453) capital if it was to reach all of the poor. Vikram Akula worked to attract venture capitalists such as Seqouia Capital, the venture capital firm behind Google and Apple. The company's expansion accelerated in 2009, as the company moved towards an IPO. SKS added 100 branch banks, trained 1,000 workers and added 400,000 borrowers in just work. Loan officers were given incentives such as expensive watches and cash bonuses for signing up as many people as fast as possible. Unsurprisingly the quality of loans dropped rapidly, and SKS loan officers had to resort to drastic tactics to [coerce ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203918304577242602296683134)repayments. SKS officers threatened borrowers with violence. Scores of suicides by desperate borrowers have been documented. The public turned against SKS bank, and it's employees were attacked if they attempted to collect loans. Eventually, the government of Andhra Pradesh stepped in, dramatically increasing regulations on microcredit and effectively shutting the for profit microcredit industry down.

Given Bangladesh and Andhra Pradesh's opposite experiences with microcredit, it is incredibly difficult to say if microcredit has a positive impact on fighting poverty. The original research on microcredit was highly promising. Studies consistently found [large ](https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/jef/vol9/iss1/2/)positive impacts on income, especially for [poor  women](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/19162/multi0page.pdf?sequence=1). However, these studies were observational rather than experimental. While economists try to control for education, income and other observable variables in their analyses,  it is impossible to control for everything. As a result, developmental economics is coming to use experimental methods such as randomized control trials to understand what works. In 2005, researchers created a microcredit experiment in [Hyderabad](https://economics.mit.edu/files/5993). They partnered with a local microcredit lender to open branches in 52 neighborhoods, and selected 52 other neighborhoods to act as a control and collected a series of survey over the next three years. The researchers found that although households in neighborhoods with a new microcredit branch borrowed substantially more and invested more in small businesses than control neighborhoods, the impact on poverty were modest. RCTs in [Ethiopia   ,](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.721.1455&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) [Bosnia ](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18538.pdf) ,[Morocco](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C15&amp;q=rct+microcredit+morocco&amp;btnG=)  and other places have consistently found disappointing results.

The best empirical evidence suggests that microcredit does not live up to the high hopes of the Grameen Bank, nor does it usually result in impoverishment as among many who borrowed from SKS Bank. It is instead a tool in the fight against global poverty that is useful in some circumstances. The development experience with micro-credit makes it clear that we can only identify the most effective anti-poverty strategies with rigorous analysis.

I had previously looked up CDs, but you have to leave the money for a certain amount of time if not, you get penalized, so I decided CDs weren't good for me.  Recently though, I came here and read about a High Yield Savings Account.  I looked that up and also found out about a Money Market Savings Account.  I was interested right away as I saw the interest rates were better than normal savings accounts.  I even saw some of the accounts let you withdrawal up to 6 times per month with no penalty.  I was wondering though, are there limits to the withdrawals or could I pull out all of the money if I did come across that good deal on a house?  I'm also trying to understand the differences of these type of savings accounts.  Which of these accounts might be better for me and my situation?  Or are there other types of savings accoints that might be better for me?  Sorry if these are stupid questions but I really would appreciate the help.  Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Debt calculator for daily and weekly payments?,"Hello! I’m looking for a debt calculator (or excel equation) I can use to see the difference it would make to split my monthly payments up into weakly or even daily intervals. I’m interested in both the time it would take to pay off the loan and the total amount that will have been paid to the lender.  

Situation specific info: 
I have a student loan with $47k in principal and $5,300 in fees (deferred in school) with a 6% interest rate. Looking at my monthly payment of $340, $260 of that is going to that months accrued interest and only $90 to fees, meaning I haven’t even touched the principal! Using online calculators it’s shown I’ll save $6k over the life of the loan to make bi weekly payments so why not just make weekly or even daily ones? I made a payment yesterday (proceeded) and today it shows $9 of interest. I figure if I split my monthly payment up into $90/ week or even $17 payments every week day I’d save a bunch in interest.  

Edit: I forgot to mention this loan has a graduated repayment plan",finance

personalfinance,"Warning: If you payed off interest in student loans (1098E), you will have to pay for eFiling this year","Apparently they moved the fields for student loan interest from the normal form to Schedule 1. idk the specifics tbh, idk what happened to the old form either.

What I do know if that because I am paying off my debt, all these online companies get to charge me $40 per filing because I need to include this stupid Schedule 1 thing. Since I work in another state, that means I have federal filing and 2 states, so it comes out to about $120 total.

Just wanted to let people know, so hopefully it's not as much of a surprise as it was for me. None of the sites I have checked (TurboTax and TaxAct) list out student loan debt as an item that will bump you out of the free tier, which seems like a scam, but everything with tax filing is a scam, so whatever.

personalfinance,Will I owe the IRS for Federal Income taxes from previous years?,"Hello all, I am currently in a very stressful situation regarding my taxes and could use some help. Before I get into the specifics, I should let you know that I am a College student living as a single dependent with my parents. When I started my job when I was 15, my mother filled out my W-4 and wrote me down as exempt from federal income tax. This was not a problem until 2016, when I ended up making MORE than the standard deduction. When I approached my boss at the time, he said this was not an issue and that I would not have to pay. I took his word for it. Today, I learned that my grandmother, who my family has gone to for taxes my entire life, has never filed a single tax return for me (even though I made more than the standard deduction the past two years). Because of this, I have decided to take matters into my own hands and am attempting to figure out how to do this on my own. However, I need help figuring out the following questions:

1. In 2016 I made $6,700.50. As a single dependent, I believe the standard deduction was $6,300. This was not filed. I did not pay Federal Income Tax this entire year. Will I owe? If yes, How do I figure out how much? Will I owe extra?
2. In 2017 I made $9,410.75. Again, As a single dependent, I believe the standard deduction this year was $6,350. This was also not filed. Federal Income tax began to be paid in October of this year (after I yet again approached my boss and this time demanded he change it). Will I owe for the rest of the year, and will I owe extra? This was not filed because my grandmother said it ""was not worth it"". 
3. What qualifies someone to be exempt from paying federal income tax? I am a student dependent being claimed by my parents, if that helps.
4. If familiar, I need help understanding the AOTC. My parents told me they receive the credit, even though my understanding is that the credit is to help pay for tuition and college expenses. I pay for all of my own tuition, textbooks, school supplies, etc.. I do live with my parents, which is why they claim the credit goes to them. Does this sound correct?

I have not received anything from the IRS saying I owe any sort of taxes or anything, which confuses me. If I owed taxes from multiple years, would they have attempted to contact me? Any sort of information anyone could provide for me would be greatly appreciated! I am a little stressed that I may owe more money than I can currently afford.

EDIT: For anyone in the same boat as me, there was a resolution I reached that nobody mentioned. You can fill out a form if you have a clean record with the IRS that asks them to forgive the penalties and interest. After speaking to three different people, I finally came across a guy that said they basically give everyone one free get out of jail free card, so to go ahead and fill it out.",finance

A little about me, I am 23 F and I graduated back in 2017. Along with grace period and then I also applied to income based repayment (IBR) my monthly payment due has been $0. This is because I was out of a job for a while due to moving back home because I couldn't afford living in the city anymore. I got a decent part time job back in November and also currently looking to getting a 2nd job (fingers crossed). I also use swagbucks in my spare time and past few months have claimed around $100.

I currently have around $1000 in my main bank account and over $5000 in my ally savings account.

It won't even come to that as I will get another job eventually. So I just want to make it clear that I won't default, but please don't just say ""just pay it all now"". I handled my previous loan well (federal one) and have never paid any interest on my credit cards. I've never defaulted on a payment.

personalfinance,Leaving the USA forever - 401k Withdrawal from Fidelity,"Hey there,

Long story short I will soon be leaving the USA forever and returning to my home country, the UK.

I am 100% certain that I will be cashing out my 401k and transferring it to an account in the UK. Main reason being I don't want these funds locked away in a foreign account for 30 years in a country that I can no longer work in etc etc. Sticky situation!

I understand there is a 10% penalty for early withdrawal, will Fidelity automatically withhold an additional 20% for Federal Taxes? 

I would prefer to take the remaining 90% with no taxes withheld and square up with IRS in Jan/Feb 2020 once all tax credits have been taken into account. I also understand the effect foreign earned income has on some tax credits such as EIC and Child Tax Credit, I will be strategic in this sense to ensure I qualify.

personalfinance,"Dealing with $100K in Undergrad Loans, then Taking out Loans for Grad School","I'm not sure what the most relevant information is so I will try to paint the whole picture. To be short I want to refinance undergraduate loans and am not sure how to do this, and am unsure of how graduate loans work. Details:


I live with my long-term girlfriend; we graduated with our bachelors' degrees in 2017. I am in the early stages of a graduate program making $40K / year gross with no student loans. She works in healthcare making $50K / year gross and wants to return to school to become a PA. On our current timelines, she would return to school in Spring/Summer 2020 and graduate approximately 2 years later in Summer 2022 (no income from her during school), after which she should work making ~100K / year gross. I will likely be in school at about 40 K salary until 2023. 


Our current financial situation is as follows: We have ~ $20K saved and are saving at a rate of ~ $2.5 K / month. We will continue to save at this rate until she starts school in ~ 12 months. We have one car which we own, and own a condo with a $260K mortgage (30 yr fixed, 4.75%) valued around $330K that we purchased in July 2018. We have no debt besides my girlfriend's $30K federal loans (~4% interest rate) and one single $76K private loan. The private loan is variable and was at 6.25% until last month where it rose to 6.75%. Her student loans combine to be about $820 per month, presently (~ $520 from private, $300 from federal). My credit score, according to Credit Karma and other credit card services, is ~ 780, my girlfriends is ~ 730. 


Going into a period where we will be living off of my salary alone, I am very uncomfortable with her having a variable rate loan that can in principle rise up to the teens in interest rate. I want to refinance the loan to a fixed rate at least, and it would be very helpful from a budgeting standpoint if we could have the loan payments defer while she is back in school. From what I can tell from the current loan provider this is not the case.


So here are some specific questions:

- I have received advertisements from Citizens Bank, SoFi, Laurel Road, etc. but do not know how to compare them against each other, or where to start on refinancing in general. Is it similar to going through banks to get a mortgage - you kind of shop around and submit all your information in short time window so the impact on your credit score is minimized? What other criteria should one use to select an institution to refinance with other than whoever offers the lowest interest rate?

- I have no student loans and the industry seems predatory to me, is there any shady practices I need to be aware of? Specifically, how do I proceed about refinancing the student loans and is it OK to do right now given our future plans of her being back in school (with no job) in about a year from now? 

- Is it OK to mention to the refinancing organizations that she intends to go back to school, or should do we need to keep that a secret from them?


Finally, I have no idea how getting graduate loans works. Will we have a problem given she has undergraduate loans and a mortgage, and has a boyfriend that she lives with that has an income? I haven't been able to find a good resource that explains the process and options of grad loans, I would love to read one if someone has one",finance

In 2018, I had 3 jobs totaling 46,000. Claimed 2 at my main job, 0 at rest. Ended up with a federal refund 197 and state refund 307. So around $500. 

In 2019, I have one job at a nonprofit agency around 35,000 a year, still claiming 2. I have no plans to get a second job. 

I only have student loan interest I can claim as a deduction. No dependents and ineligible for EIC because of my income. 

Reasoning to claim 2 was to get more in paycheck. I don't care about size of refund clearly. Just don't want to end up owing next year after reading about all these changes and not having 3 jobs over the course of a year. 

I tried a calculator with IRS and turbotax and just got ridiculously confused. It seems like 2 is more of a risk but I'm afraid claiming 0 will cut my take home pay significantly. 

Any advice would be great!! Thanks. 

Edit:
Bracket info: 
 12% $9,526 to $38,700

22% $38,701 to $82,500 
Tax owed: $4,453.50 plus 22% of the amount over $38,700

personalfinance,Snowball or Avalanche...which is best?,"Hi. My husband and I are starting the adventure of paying off our student loans and cars. In total we'll be paying off $50,500 in the next year. I've been using the site [unbury.us](https://unbury.us) to map out our payoff, but am having a hard time choosing between paying off snowball or avalanche style. Our loans are listed below. If we do snowball, we pay $174 more in interest total....but every loan will be paid off by the end of December except for the biggest (it would be paid off by May of 2020....February if we go into our savings to wipe it out/use tax return).

For those who have aggressively tackled your debt, which method works best for you and why? I love the idea of seeing progress quickly and not having so many loans to worry about. However, the biggest loan we have is a private student loan....so if something were to happen to us in terms of employment then we wouldn't be able to claim forbearance like we would my federal student loan. Whereas if we do the avalanche method, one of the last two loans will be a federal student loan and the other will be a super low interest car payment.

Any advice is appreciated! :)

stocks,Buy now? Spy?,"Wanted to put my thoughts on paper and see how others felt.  Spy has had a ton of volatility the last few months, went down to the low 230s and has now bounced all the way back up to high 270s.  

Politically things in the US are heating up.  It seems like each week one of trumps campaign managers are getting indicted.  Additionally the trade war with China and possibly Europe.  

These are leaving some huge ifs in the market right now.   With spy at 278 it is only 5-6% from all time highs.  I just don’t see the risk / reward in buying right now when the potential downside is probably 2-5x the upside.  I’m not saying to short the market, but I find the intense buying in the 270s interesting.  I see stocks hitting all time highs, but overall it just seems like a very risky time to buy something at an all time high.  Even buying spy 5% from ATH seems like a bad investment right now.

Also it seems like the fed not increasing rates has a lot of people feeling bullish.  Why does this have so much impact ? 

Posting this because maybe there is a lot of potential upside that I am just not seeing.  Maybe someone can convince me otherwise...",finance

investing,Why banks loan money ?,"I've been wondering about this for a while...

If the historical market return is about 7%, why banks loan money at a low interest rate (example : 3% mortage) instead of just investing in the stock market ? Is it just a way for them to diversify and manage risk ? Is it legally impossible for banks to invest too much in the stock market with their clients money ? What am I missing ?

Thanks !",finance
MachineLearning,[P] A Python to Scala transpiler using neural machine translation (NMT),"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to learn more about neural machine translation (NMT) so I created a small project to translate programming expression in the Python language into Scala. Details in [this blog post](https://medium.com/@matthagy/a-python-to-scala-transpiler-using-neural-machine-translation-nmt-90d4d02afa70). [The code is on GitHub](https://github.com/matthagy/nmt_python_scala_transpiler).

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize challenges in dealing with the recursive structure of complex, nested expressions. Is anyone aware of NMT methods that are designed to capture such recursive patterns? Currently, I'm using a LMST fed into an attention decoder.

&amp;#x200B;

At present, the methods can only translate 56.5% of expressions correctly. Any ideas for how I could improve performance? Here are some I have:

* Train the model for longer (currently trained for about 90 epochs in \~8 hours on a GPU)
* Increase the size of the training data. Currently using 320,000 observations.
* Increase the size of the LSTM layer
* Increase the size of the attention decoder layer
* Experiment with different NMT network architectures

Thanks for any help! I'd also appreciate any critique of the work and blog post. Trying to get better at NMT methods and writing.",technology
stocks,US Stocks slipping in early morning trading on weak news flow ahead of release of US Federal Reserve minutes,"US Stocks

* US stocks index futures are drifting lower this morning on a quiet Wednesday morning with front-month Dow Jones minis –0.10%, S&amp;P 500 minis –0.06%, and Nasdaq 100 minis +0.01%.
* Strategists at SunTrust Private Wealth Management argue that the recent gains in US stocks suggest that further gains lie ahead.  As of yesterday's close, 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 were above their 50-day moving average. 
* In spite of December’s weak retail sales, Wall Street analysts continue to be positive about earnings for the US consumer discretionary sector going forward.  Over the past few weeks, the Consensus outlook for consumer discretionary earnings growth has actually increased. 
* According to Investors Intelligence (II), stocks newsletters has turned positive, currently, sitting at 51.9%, the first time the reading has broken above 50% since late October.  II typically begins to worry about too much newsletter optimism AFTER the rate breaks above 50%. 
* While the S&amp;P 500 is on pace for its best 2 month run since 2010, US treasury yields continue to hover close to their recent lows.  Worries about a deceleration in global growth has fueled demand for US government bonds.  The divergence in stocks and bonds raises concerns about whether the recent rally in US stocks is over-extended.
* US trade officials are purportedly asking their Chinese counterparts to agree to keeping the value of the Chinese Renminbi stable as part of their trade negotiations.  The goal would be to neutralize any attempt by Beijing official to devalue the Yuan to counter US tariffs, etc. 
* The VIX is little changed this morning and is currently at 15.15 after closing at 14.88 yesterday
* Eli Lilly (LLY) OTM Calls &amp; Puts, EEM April 18 OTM Puts and S&amp;P 500 Minis (XSP) April 18 OTM Puts are some of the most heavily traded options in the US pre-market this morning. 
* US 10-Year Treasury Bonds are higher with yields down -0.18 basis points to 2.6321%
* The US Treasury 2s-10s Spread has narrowed 0.17 basis points to 0.15%
* WTI Crude is currently up 0.9% to USD$56.09/bbl with the Brent-WTI spread down USD$-1.73 to USD$9.33/bbl
* Gold is currently up 0.21% to USD$1343.8/oz -- current prices levels for Gold put it at a 10-month high 
* Palladium prices are rallying to record highs, currently sitting at USD$1,500/oz, as a supply shortage is causing car manufacturers to race to collect the precious metal used to manage car emission controls.  Palladium prices have more than tripled since the beginning of CY2016.  The supply shortage is so acute that automakers are actually leasing the metals from ETFs holder of palladium to meet their demands.

Apparently I owe NJ ~$2000?","Hi all, I've gotten a lot of good advice here from reading comments on others' posts, so I hope someone can point me in the right direction here. Please let me know if additional information is needed.

So, I live in NJ but work in NY. Taxes are taken out for NY and they have a reciprocity agreement with NJ (or something like that). Box 1 in my w2 is close to $60,000. 

On my federal w4, I elected to take 2 allowances, and according to H&amp;R Block's software I'll be getting a refund of $80. Perfect.

In my state w4s, I chose 0 allowances for both NY and NJ.

It seems that NY will refund me $200, whereas I owe NJ almost $2000. 

For some reason, in Box 16 of the w2, my NJ wages are $2000 more than NY wages, but the amount owed to NJ is close to $2000 either way.

My questions:

- What could possibly causing this, if it is accurate?

- Could I be entering some information wrong, hence these numbers?

- And if it is accurate, what should I do to avoid this in the future?

Thank you!!!

personalfinance,Fund HSA now for 2018 COBRA payments?,"All of 2018 I paid COBRA payments to pay health care premiums. I was enrolled in a High Deductible Health Care plan.

I am realizing now that COBRA payments can be paid from an HSA. I am also realizing that I can fund my 2018 HSA this year, providing I do so before April 15.

My COBRA premiums were $12000 for the year. I currently have $4500 in my HSA (edit - HSA established prior to 2018)

So what I am thinking of doing is to add $7750 to HSA for 2018 ( I am over 55, wife is not). This will put enough money in my HSA to pay all the 2018 premiums.

If I do this, I will be making the $7750 non-taxable; my combined Fed &amp; State marginal tax rate is 17.75%. This means I’ll save $1376.

Does this make sense? Am I interpreting the rules correctly?

Would I move the $7750 into the HSA, and then immediately withdraw it to pay myself back?

Would I need a tax form from my HSA company?

personalfinance,Need Feedback on this Real Estate Plan,"Basically, I'm wondering if it makes financial sense to keep my current residence as a rental for 2-3 years after I buy a new house to take advantage of the tax benefits.

&amp;#x200B;

Personal Finance Situation:

&amp;#x200B;

30 years old, family of 4 (2 kids), household income of 150k/year.

Gross Income is \~110k salary, \~40k in annual RSU grants.

130k equity in current home (current appraised value minus remaining balance).

\- 1500/mo payments on 15 year mortgage, which includes escrow for property tax and insurance

\- Property tax \~2400, Insurance \~1200 per year

\- 140k principle remaining, currently appraised at 270k

\- Mortgage interest rate 3.375%

90k in individual taxable investment account (non-retirement).

45k in cash (emergency/savings)

90k in 401k (maxing annually)

26k in one Traditional IRA (phased out)

5.5k in another Traditional IRA (maxing annually)

33k in inherited Roth IRA (can be cashed out without penalty)

5k in HSA (contributing \~4500/year, 2k of which is contributed by employer)

\~70k in RSU's of company stock vesting over 3 years, with annual grants of 35-50k.

2 cars paid off, worth 35k total.

No debt besides mortgage.

Total monthly expenses are around 4k, while net income after deductions is around 7.5k.

Credit score 820.

&amp;#x200B;

Plan:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to buy a house for a purchase price of \~550k.  I'd like to put 25% down for an optimal rate, requiring 137.5k.  I'd prefer not to take gains on my taxable investments, so I'm considering a max HELOC for 90% of my current equity, in the amount of 117k.  The remaining \~20k I can get from a mix of emergency savings and inherited Roth, or a source that can give me an interest free loan with the expectation of repayment after sale of current residence in 2-3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I expect to get about $1700+/month from rent of my current residence.  I'm not concerned about finding a renter, the market in my area is extremely hot.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea to rent current residence for 2-3 years is to take advantage of the capital gain exclusion, since I've lived in the home for 5 years.  I would be able to deduct depreciation and expenses (considering property management company) from rental income, which could likely exceed rental income and reduce MAGI.  I expect building is worth \~160k, which I think means I can deduct \~6k worth of depreciation each year.  My current mortgage rate is favorable, and with a 15 year mortgage I'm building equity at a good rate.

&amp;#x200B;

I've historically been pretty conservative with my finances, and feel like I have a decent grasp on the financial aspects of this situation, but I've not been a landlord before.  Is this a good plan, or do I have anything incorrect here?  Anything I'm not thinking of?  Being that I have the cushion of my taxable investment account and inherited IRA, I feel ok about being able to dip into that should the need arise to make a major repair in the rental, which would then be deducted at tax time.

Traditional IRA balance: $26k (Should I convert to Roth?)

401k balance: $14k (contributing at 7%, company matches up to 50% of first 5%)

Car Loan for 2016 Rav4: $287/mo (will pay off in approximately 12 months 2.19% APR)

Credit Score: Hovering at 800+

Credit Card is paid off monthly.

Student Loans :$295/mo (balance is around $16k. will pay off in about 5 years - about 5.5% interest rate) **Note:** Company I currently work for will contribute $100 a month for 5 years to student loans upon working at company for at least 6 months for a maximum total of $6,000. This is about $1,000 less than what I would be paying on interest overall on my student loans. (\~$7,000)

Current Fixed Expenses/Month (This includes rent, electricity, internet, phone, water) \~$1500. After food and miscellaneous/entertainment items, I can maybe overall save about $750 a month.

Current liquid cash on hand in savings/checking/emergency fund \~$6k.

stocks,Ladybaybee recommended picks for 2019-02-20,"[Link to imgur showing a screenshot of picks](https://imgur.com/a/NSVzesC)

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this  stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(90d)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past 3 months. The column “Tx(90d)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last 3 months. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past 90 days, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on. 

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

HOW I USE THIS:
 For the time being I am trying to keep things on the safe side. So I tend to go for the stocks that have success rate of 1.0, and more than 1 in Tx(90d), The Growth(90d) and Factor tell me how hot are the agents that are in charge of analyzing this stock are. Beyond this point, I also go for stocks with State equal to ready_to_buy because I make this to mean that the upwards tendency is just about to start so it has more potential to grow. State ready_to_sell isn't bad either, it just means that the system had detected the upward trend in previous days and it still thinks that the trend will continue this way. The system doesn't actually tell me how long the upwards tendency will be. I run the models everyday at noon NY time, so the programs just tells me: ""I think you should buy this TODAY"" or ""I think you should sell it TODAY"" Just as an added heuristic, I tend to sell all my stocks on Fridays because I don't like the uncertainty that weekends and long weekends bring, but that is just a personal opinion.

**OPINION ABOUT TODAY**:
Looks like the market is still feeling contracted, and not abundant in opportunities. Makes sense that GOLD would rise up although with it's track record I would recommend being very careful about trading these stocks.",finance

I was expecting a year or two but it came out to about 4! We would pay her loans off with the minimum payment in 5!

I am just a little discouraged and needed a place to vent... Thanks for reading my post, and any advice or help would be appreciated if you got it!

Edit: A lot of people think we should try the avalanche instead of snowball. When you do this how do you break ties with loans at the same interest rate? Do you pay the larger one or smaller first?",finance
CryptoCurrency,BitMax - Margin POV,"The coin market has been pretty slow for the past month. Most days, BTC doesn’t even move 1%. With such little movement, there’s just a few opportunities to scalp small profits but absolutely zero room for major trades. In times like this, margin becomes a trader’s best friend. 

I’m sure most traders have been using margin for the past month to make ends meet, and most of that volume has been going to BitMEX. Considering the volume of shorts has been on the rise, BitMEX isn’t the best option since BTC is the key currency. On top of that, I’ve become a bit fed up with BitMEX’s need for pre-mature liquidations in order to support its insurance fund. That fund gets bigger. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. BitMEX seems to be less a margin exchange and more like the best insurance operation in history given the rate of growth its insurance fund has seen. But what’s my option? I’m not going to Deribit; there’s no volume. 

OKEx isn’t exactly a good option either. They failed to manage their own [market risk](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2163199/blowout-worlds-second-largest-digital-exchange-exposes-soft)s and had to take huge profits from traders. Since I have been short for a while, I had to fork out some of my profits and that really pissed me off. Plus, just 2 months after that, they pulled off the [most disgraceful stunt](https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/11/19/bitcoin-cash-futures-closed/) in the history of crypto exchanges by closing user contracts prematurely without any warning; positions that were in a loss but nowhere close to their liquidation point were suddenly closed, leaving traders at huge losses. So, that just leaves us with BitMEX. 

Except, there’s one new margin option and it just started so I can’t be too certain on how good or bad it is. 

BitMax (How quaint? It rhymes with BitMEX) just opened its doors a few months ago, and it started off as a spot exchange. However, a day ago, they allowed traders to use margin. The max margin is only 6x and while that’s nowhere near the 100x on MEX, you shouldn’t be using 100x leverage anyways. I don’t care how good your trades have been, literally everyone I know who has used 100x has gotten burned really quick. 

Anyways, so far, I really like the trading interface since they converted common spot trading interfaces into a margin one. Most people will have an easy time using it, but there’s another drawback. Since, it only just launched, I can only spot margin pairs for BTC, ETH and XRP. The good thing, though, is that all 3 of these coins are available for margin trading on USDT pairs. Since I am still bearish, this is a good option for me. When my short profits roll in, my gains will be in USDT rather than BTC, which would be worth less than when I had entered the position. Of course, for those of you who are still bullish, there’s BTC margin pairs too. 

I really hope the volume picks up. The UI is nice, they have Tether pairs, and the exchange’s track record on their spot exchange is quite good in terms of service. If volume starts improving, BitMax could definitely be a top alternative to MEX.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Please Help Me Plan,"Hey guys. I posted about a week ago but have some updates &amp; need some more advice. So I will be graduating in May with $62,500 in student loans. I have means to get that down to about $10 - $15k before my payments begin in January of 2020. My girlfriend and I are going to be moving to a nearby city and will be paying anywhere between $1,300 &amp; $1,700 for rent. She will be graduating in May as well with about the same amount of loans as I have. She unfortunately does not have any means to bring that amount down before payments begin and still has to do a Masters degree. Also, about half of her loans are private and have a 6 - 7% interest rate. I am getting really worried about her loans and how much I should help her. She will begin substitute teaching hopefully while doing her Masters and maybe some tutoring if possible. I don't think she will make any more than $25-30k a year until she becomes a full time teacher. I will be making $70k gross. Using some online estimated payment calculators, almost all of her income will be going towards her student loan payments which really concerns me. What are your recommendations for tackling her student loans? I assume I will have to foot our rent, groceries, utilities, etc until she gets out from under her loans a bit. Should I be as worried as I am? Also, If I do have residual income and a emergency savings and whatnot, should I help her with her payments? The amount of interest alone that she would pay by making minimum payments I feel would really impede any future plans of maybe one day getting a house or things like that.

investing,Stocks seesaw after Federal Reserve notes increasing risks to the economy,"&gt;Stocks gyrated on Wednesday as Wall Street tried to interpret a release from the Federal Reserve which summarized its crucial meeting last month where the central bank indicated it would be patient on future rate hikes.  
&gt;  
&gt;As of 2:30 p.m. ET, the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.DJI) traded 21 points higher and briefly rose nearly 100 points. The [S&amp;P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.SPX)hovered just above the flatline, while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.IXIC) was down 0.1 percent. The three indexes reached their session highs right after the minutes were released.  
&gt;  
&gt;[The Fed meeting minutes](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/20/the-fed-just-released-minutes-from-its-market-moving-meeting.html) highlighted downside risks to the economy from its January meeting, including ""the possibilities of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in China and Europe, a rapid waning of fiscal policy stimulus, or a further tightening of financial market conditions.""  
&gt;  
&gt;However, some equity investors may be encouraged by language in the minutes regarding its hotly debated balance sheet normalization. Bulls want the Fed to stop reducing its balance sheet, arguing that practice is a de facto tightening of monetary conditions. The central bank did hint in the minutes that it may end its balance-sheet normalization this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Almost all participants thought that it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the Federal Reserve's asset holdings later this year,"" the minutes stated. 'Such an announcement would provide more certainty about the process for completing the normalization of the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. dollar hit its session low after the minutes were released, but later recovered to trade around breakeven. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), considered the best gauge of fear in the market, was down 3.2 percent at 14.4.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Jan. 30, the Fed it will be ""patient"" in tightening monetary policy moving forward and kept interest rates unchanged.  
&gt;  
&gt;Stocks have been on a tear lately in part because of the Fed's perceived pause on rate hikes. The Dow and Nasdaq are riding an eight-week winning streak, while the S&amp;P 500 is up seven of the past eight weeks. Since the Fed's meeting in January, the major indexes are all up more than 4 percent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Investors are also watching out for developments on U.S.-China trade talks as officials launched a new round of negotiations on Tuesday. A follow-up session of higher-level talks is expected later in the week, as both sides look to resolve the long-running trade war before an early March deadline.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We think part of the recovery in share prices is with the suggestion that we've seen progress in \[trade\] talks,"" said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""To sustain this, we need to actually see policy and not just progress.""  
&gt;  
&gt;President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) has suggested he might extend the deadline for a deal, telling reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday that March 1 was not a ""magical date."" An extension to the current deadline would prevent an immediate increase in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We expect some sort of conditional deal to be reached; however, uncertainty regarding the bilateral negotiations is likely to persist, particularly because at the core of the discussion there are structural issues such as intellectual property protection,"" said Vincent Mortier, group deputy CIO at Amundi Asset Management, in a note.  
&gt;  
&gt;CVS Health shares fell more than 7 percent after issuing a [weaker-than-expected earnings forecast for 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/20/cvs-health-q4-2018-earnings.html). The company's guidance comes after closing a $70 billion deal to acquire health insurer Aetna in November.

personalfinance,Please explain my BOA checking account closure,"I will preface by saying that BOA is a shit bank and Im curious over what prompted this situation.  

&amp;#x200B;

I opened a checking account last year to facilitate paying off BOA credit cards and moving money to Merril Edge to maintain their highest customer service tier for better cash back on their credit cards.   I noticed when I logged in last night on their app that all my BOA accounts were missing and also when I logged from a computer browser. I thought this was pretty odd and thought it may be a computer glitch. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I logged in again this morning, same deal and after calling around I ultimately got a robotic script from a CS representative that my checking account was being closed with no explanation offered.  The only transaction I can think of that prompted this was a balance transfer check from PenFed that I tried to cash recently through their mobile app.  The bank placed a hold for two weeks which I thought was excessive but whatever to allay their fraud concerns.  

&amp;#x200B;

Is this what happens when you try to deposit a BT check at a crap big bank like BOA?  Ive never done one before but this would have been quite a hassle if I actually used their account for my checking needs.  BTW their special CS phone line for Platinum Honors tiers is a joke and the same stupid phone tree and excessive wait times.",finance

personalfinance,Parents in the hole $36k. I came up with a plan. Any advice?,"My parents finally revealed their personal fiances to me a few weeks ago, and after the initial shock wore off, I gathered as much data as I could and came up with the best plan I could think up. I'm hoping for some input to see if we're on the right track. Here's the basic data:

* Both in Mid 60s. Always rented, never owned a home. No advanced degrees, so no student debt.
* Dad is on disability. Fixed income. Lots of health issues and prescriptions, but its all mostly covered with medicare.
* Mom is working full time. She pushes herself and is working on borrowed time by ignoring some major health issues, and makes it worse by chain smoking. Major health issues and expenditures are all but inevitable.
   * Mom is notoriously bad with money and spending. Borders on hoarding depending on state of mental health.
* Mom is getting laid off this summer with a decent severance package of $10k-$15k. They will then move back near me in the summer.
   * Estimated moving cost $5000
   * Future job for my Mom uncertain
* They own two nearly identical SUVs:
   * 2014, 36k miles. Bought new for $25k. Current balance on 9% loan about $4000. Monthly payment over $400
   * 2015, 18k miles. Bought new for $25k. Current balance on 12% loan about $10000. Monthly payment over $400
* They have 11 credit cards between the two of them with varying limits ($500-$6500) and interest rates (17%-29%) taken out over the years. Total credit card debt is $18000. Combined monthly payments over $600.
   * Some are store cards with ""rewards."" This is the trap my mom falls for.
* About 2 years ago they secretly took out a personal loan from a bank to pay off their credit cards. $12000, 13% APR
   * Needless to say, they did not do this, and there is still a balance of about $4000. Monthly payment over $600
* I don't know their credit scores, but at their age they wont be  buying a new house or car, so I think the only near-term impact will be running credit when applying for apartments this Spring.
* I don't know their income. My best estimate is about $4000/mo
* Their cash on hand/liquid assets are as follows
   * $4000 in personal savings
   * $4000 tax return
   * $2000 bonus from work
   * Estimated $12000 severance due this summer
   * KBB value of both SUVs is about $9000
   * Random trinkets, baubles, and technology they could liquidate through Craigslist, eBay, etc.

My basic plan is as follows:

1. Use the $4000 tax return to pay off the personal loan ASAP.
2. Pay off 2014 SUV with bonus/savings. Sell to dealer. No trade-in.
3. Use profit from 2014 SUV to pay off/down 2015 SUV. This becomes sole mode of transportation.
4. 1-3 eliminate half of their debt, and reduce their combined monthly debt payments by 3/4, or about $1500/mo.
5. Use reclaimed $1500/mo to prepare for summer move and make payments on credit cards based on severity.
6. Use majority of severance to pay off remaining credit cards in summer.
7. Close most credit card accounts after pay off, particularly high interest and store cards. Leave a few accounts open for emergencies.

If my plan is executed, as aggressive as it is, they could go into 2020 with:

* moved across country out of pocket
* little or no credit card debt, save 2 cards with $0 balances
* owning their one and only car
* no personal loan debt
* Mom is hopefully working towards retirement

gaming,A solution to micro-transactions and premium passes,"This has probably been suggested before but I want to share my idea on this. I'm in NZ so all currency is NZD. TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to play GTA Online a lot. When I say a lot, I'm not a 10+ hours a day person. I'm a uni student so would only play after I got home and had dinner. So maybe 4 hours a day tops, and not every day. I played lots of other games too. When I say a lot, I mean fairly regularly, enough to have gathered some possessions and got a pretty decent understanding of the game. Overall I've probably spent 250 hours in-game (not sure if that includes loading screens). So maybe a lot for a casual gamer? Idk you be the judge. I consider myself someone with a normal level of patience and time. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, the cost of items in-game is so prohibitive to those with a job or standard levels of patience, that if you want anything decent you're forced to fork out a fairly decent (minimum $20) amount of real-life money, on top of what you've already paid to enjoy the game. Sounds like standard micro-transaction B.S. right? Right. Now I know there's the git-gud crew reading this getting ready to tell me all of the ways I could have earned $10M in a day, but save it, seriously. Either you have literally 20 hours of a day to play that mind-numbing crap or you didn't realise you'd actually been at your PlayStation for two weeks. Either way, no normal person can be expected to do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Games have costed around $100 for as long as I can remember (which is probably around when Jak and Daxter released on PS2). They still cost around the same, but have loads more go into making them, updating them, and creating new content. Not to mention the depth of some systems, balancing, sheer world-size, and so on. They reduce the amount of content in the game to bring you this well established price point, and then release the rest of it behind a paywall in the form of a premium version or micro-transactions. I'm sure you're all familiar.

&amp;#x200B;

This is such absolute B.S. The publishers are literally lying to your face when they say you have a full game here with your $100 purchase, because it's not, it's only the foundation. Battlefield 4 to me is worth the \~$180 I'd pay with the premium pass, **2 years after release.** Just say it to my face. Tell me the game is $180 dollars now and all the DLC will be free. I'm fine with this. It creates a better customer-company relationship in that I don't feel cheated or abused by receiving half a product when I thought I'd bought it all. If the new standard of game price is $180 then so be it. I can respect that $100 now is not what it was 18 years ago, nor are video games. But I would rather have a finished product that had some damn effort go into it.

&amp;#x200B;

So you buy the base game, and the pub/devs (I'm not sure who, I'll just say devs) gets paid for their ongoing support through micro-transactions or premium/season pass. The people who have the time and patience to sink into earning in-game items can do so, while the rest of us have to pay or miss out. This means that a portion of the players are paying the devs for new content and updates while the hardcore people who have the time and patience to spare get it for free. **There is a serious flaw here.** This skyrockets the price each paying player must pay to support ongoing content, because they are a small portion of people paying for not only their own play-time, but the people who don't pay as well. This is absolutely not fair. If games are subscription based and everyone is forced to pay an ongoing cost for the continuous support and content, then the development costs are spread evenly across the player-base. Per player costs can drop to reasonable levels (I'm happy to pay $10 - $20 a month) and no one is getting ripped off. No mandatory micro-transactions because you get in-game currency with your subscription, free DLC because the devs are already being paid for their work. This will also help fix the problem of planned obsolescence with games, because instead of making a new FIFA or AC that's basically identical, new content can just be added to the main one and it's already paid for by ALL those who will be using it. I'm taking this idea from ESO because it *works,* and no one is complaining.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise this is a long way to say games as a service, but I really feel like as a community we should be pushing for this. Publishers are making too much money from us to back down, and if we don't buy their games we won't have anything to play. Games as a service is a middle ground where everyone is happy, no one is getting overpaid, and everyone is contributing to the ongoing development costs that modern games require. I'm just so fed up with potentially decent games and developers being ruined by greedy corporations trying to pump out as many games as possible with as much incentive to micro-spend as possible. It's seriously destroying my love for video games and I'm over it.

&amp;#x200B;

So to conclude. Charge more for games if it's a game with a finite lifespan (like Battlefield 4), or charge a subscription if it's continuous (like ESO or GTAO). Games cost more to make, I get it. But stop abusing the people who pay you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to anyone who actually read this far. While I hope it is, I don't care if my voice isn't heard. I really just felt like ranting about this because it's been bugging me for a while. Good day to you all. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: People who don't have time to grind away at a game for in-game items end up paying for the ongoing developer costs that should be paid by all users. If the costs were split evenly across the player-base they would be far less per person and would be a comfortable rate for everyone (think ESO). Secondly, because games take longer to make and more effort goes into them, increase the base cost of the game instead of selling it split into paid DLC.",technology

Fast forward to now; neither parents have the liquid amount needed for my sisters student loan. I really don’t want to give her all my savings, because not only will everything be cleaned out, but I still don’t have enough stashed away to cover the excess needed.  
Not to mention if I dont sign I’m basically taking her education away from her. We’ve had unstable parents as it is. I ‘d like her to at least have one person to look to for stability.  
But I also don’t want to sign all her student loans, completely tank my credit, and screw my self over. 
Am I over  thinking this? Always found this sub to be super helpful so...advice would be very welcome. 

Edit: i myself have 19,000 out in student loan debt and around 2000 in personal debt...not sure if that helps",finance
worldpolitics,Does a Sheriff Really Have The Right To Choose Which Laws To Enforce? By Sheriff Richard Mack (Ret),"Does a Sheriff Really Have The Right To Choose Which Laws To Enforce? 

By Sheriff Richard Mack (Ret)

I have received several media inquiries regarding the sheriffs in Washington and New Mexico who are valiantly standing against their states' attempts to promote Gun Control. Invariably, these well-intended reporters ask how it is that our nation's sheriffs can choose which laws to enforce. The answer is an easy one: because that is precisely what they promised to do. But in the case of Washington, the people voted by referendum to support more gun control by 58%. So the sheriffs there have the duty to go along with ""the will of the people."" Right?

WRONG! Perhaps in a Democracy this would be true, but America IS NOT a Democracy. Despite all the brainwashing of the last 150 years claiming that the USA is a Democracy, the truth of the matter is that we are absolutely, unequivocally, a Constitutional Republic. The difference being that in a Democracy the majority rules. In our Constitutional Republic, the Constitution rules, and is unquestionably and unambiguously, the Supreme Law of the Land.

Therefore, the law in Article 6 of the U.S. Constitution that requires that ""all legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers... shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution,"" says exactly what the sheriff is required to do. Incidentally, the sheriff takes the same oath to the Constitution as Justices of the Supreme Court and the President.

So, all three branches of government, at all levels - cities, counties, states and federal - have differing assignments but the same purpose: to secure and protect the rights of the people. This is the proper pole of government and is the paramount duty of the sheriff, city council, county commission, state legislature, congress, POTUS, and every judge in this country. Our sworn duty is to support the Constitution and thus, defend the unalienable rights of the people we work for.

Martin Luther King said, ""I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.""

""All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are null and void."" Marbury vs. Madison

Dr. King was absolutely correct and so was SCOTUS in this landmark case of 1803. No sheriff has any obligation to enforce any law contrary to the Constitution. Our ultimate goal in America is L I B E R T Y. When laws become the ""tool of the tyrant"" or when laws become the evil they were intended to punish, then it becomes the duty of all sheriffs and peace officers in every state to oppose them, not enforce them. Could there ever be any worse tyranny than the blind enforcement of unconstitutional laws?

To secure liberty, we must stand against all officers of government when they are wrong and contrary to Constitution. We must even do this when the people themselves go against the rights that are guaranteed in the Constitution. (Again, this exemplifies the difference between a democracy and a constitutional republic.)

We should also be looking at history for these some of these answers. Not a single Black Code should have ever been enforced. No Jim Crow laws should have ever been enforced and certainly, the idiotic ruling in Plessy v Ferguson that established the ""Separate but Equal"" doctrine should have never seen the light of day, yet this ruling perpetuated segregation for another 55 years! The Supreme Court was wrong and every state and every sheriff should have opposed such nonsense. And no, Rosa Parks should have never been arrested for failing to give her seat to a white man. But she was. The history lesson here is that we never enforce such laws today that clearly violate the rights of the people.

The CSPOA absolutely applauds and stands with the sheriffs in Washington and New Mexico and the county commissioners of Quay County, NM who made their county a ""Second Amendment Sanctuary."" These are true American heroes and they are clearly on solid legal and historical ground.

""It is impossible to introduce into society a greater change and a greater evil than this: the conversion of the law into an instrument of plunder."" Frederick Bastiat

Let us carry the torch of liberty today in every aspect of government, that every citizen and public official may understand that programs and statutes could never become superior to the principles our country was based on. What is the solution to all societal ills, taxation, immigration, poverty, politics, crime, corruption, climate change, national debt, etc.?

Liberty is still the answer.


The Constitutional Sheriffs Movement
Is On The March
By Rick Dalton

Sheriffs around the nation are doing their sworn duty to intervene and protect the rights of their constituents.
Unconstitutional gun control laws are introduced in many state legislatures and in the federal Congress on a regular basis. This year is no exception. When this happens, Constitutional Sheriffs and other law enforcement officers stand up and oppose them. Again, this year is no exception.

In Washington state, as reported by the Wall Street Journal:

More than a dozen county sheriffs in Washington state are refusing to enforce a sweeping gun-control measure that passed with the support of 59% of the state's voters in November.

The new law raises the age for buying semiautomatic rifles to 21 from 18, stiffens background checks for purchases of semiautomatic rifles, and imposes new criminal penalties for the unsafe storage of firearms.

It is the most wide-reaching gun control law passed anywhere in the U.S. since a 19-year-old gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., with a semiautomatic rifle one year ago this week, killing 17 people.

At least 16 elected sheriffs, primarily from rural, conservative counties that voted against the measure, say they won't enforce the law because they believe it is unconstitutional. Most have been vague about which parts they won't impose.

The gun-control law is being challenged in court by the Second Amendment Foundation and the National Rifle Association, who argue that some of the new regulations deny people their constitutional right to bear arms. The recently filed suit is currently pending.


Sheriff Brad Manke
Stevens County, WA
""I'm morally opposed to any law that's really against our Second Amendment rights,"" said Brad Manke, sheriff of Stevens County in northeast Washington, where Initiative 1639 received only 27% support. ""It's difficult to have laws forced upon you.""

Sheriffs in the rest of Washington's 39 counties, as well as the vast majority of the state's 200-plus police chiefs, haven't publicly stated that they plan to defy the new law.

Whether it's criminalizing private gun sales, taking guns away by SWAT actions from people who others say ""might"" hurt somebody with a gun, or holding you responsible for a neighbor who might steal your gun from you and shoot somebody, it's the same ""common sense"" violations of human rights of the average citizen by force to attempt to stop bad guys and crazies from gun violence. As always, it's the gun that is the target, not the bad actor. And these gun laws are introduced around the nation in many states in the hopes that they will slip past our Constitutional protectors.

CSPOA is proud of Sheriff Manke and hundreds of others who are standing in the gap by interposing in these cases to stop the destruction of liberty.

In another example of the Constitutional Sheriff Movement's strong force for limited government, as reported by the Ruidoso News:

New gun control laws being considered by the New Mexico Legislature are opposed by most law enforcement officials in Lincoln County, and many in the state. ""I'm worn out. My brain is fried dealing with Santa Fe,"" Sheriff Robert Shepperd said Friday. ""I have been going every week or twice a week to testify before committees.""

""Twenty-eight of New Mexico's 33 sheriffs oppose House Bill 8 covering universal background checks,"" he said. On Friday the New Mexico House of Representatives passed House Bill 8, on a 41-25 vote.

""Any type of sale, transfer or transaction of firearms whether to a stranger or your son, your daughter, has to go through a licensed firearm dealer for a background check on the individual,"" Shepperd said. ""We're opposed to any more restrictive gun measures at all. This is just a step closer to full gun registration.""

* Income = \~60,000/year (takehome = \~3200/month)
* Outstanding federal student loans = \~200,000 (and growing I think because of interest capitalization maybe?)
* Consolidated private loans = \~25,000 (down from 45K about a year ago)

* Cell phone = 50/month
* Private loan payment = 900/month
* Federal Loan payment (in income-based repayment plan w/25 year forgiveness)= 300/month

I got married a couple years ago to someone that is doing well financially. Based on my spouse's tax-reported income, I got kicked out of my repayment plan.

Below are the options I was giving by the retirement company. 

-Request a Lump Sum Distribution: Lump sum payment of your vested account balance paid directly to you. If you select a lump sum distribution, a 20% mandatory federal tax withholding will apply. If you receive the payment before age 591⁄2, you will be subject to a 10% 72(t) early withdrawal penalty State taxes and penalties may also apply.

-Request a direct rollover to another 401(k) plan: A direct rollover of your retirement benefit allows you to continue to postpone taxation of your retirement account balance until it is paid directly to you. A qualified employer retirement plan is not legally required to accept a rollover. Please ensure that your current employer’s qualified plan will accept rollovers and, if so, the types of distributions it accepts, possible different tax treatments of subsequent distributions, and any required documents that need to be completed.

-Direct rollover to a traditional IRA: A rollover to an IRA allows you to continue to postpone taxation of the benefit until it is paid to you. Your payment cannot be rolled over to a SIMPLE IRA, or a Coverdell Education Savings Account (formerly known as an Education IRA).

My company has not yet chosen another company for our 401k nor do I see that happening anytime soon. Is there a way for me to get the funds and invest myself? Or would that incur penalties?",finance

From what I understand, since REITs also rely heavily on leverage to generate profits, would it be advisable to leverage to invest in REITs even if interest rates are rising/uncertain? This would cause me to be heavily exposed and vulnerable to rising interest rates both from my own leverage and the REITs' leverage as well.

personalfinance,Advice needed... use tax return to wipe out Credit Card debt or save for rent money? (Moving to Boston for a 6 month internship),"**TL;DR:** What would be the better thing for me to do?

I currently have: -$2900 CC/Line of Credit Debt, ~$2900 cash, 1 Line of Credit+1 Credit Card totaling $4,000 available when nothing is charged to them, fairly low interest rates (Paying them down would reduce all of my debt, aside from Student Debt, to zero), and am going to have to pay at least 1 month's rent to move to Boston for 6 months.

* Wipe out all of my debt, live off my CC/LOC and probably withdraw funds from them to front moving costs later

* Pay debt down to a lower level (e.g. throw $1000-$1500 at the debt, place remaining tax refund money into savings)

* Make a very small payment on the debt ($500), keep up on my payments for the next few months (Which total out to maybe $50/mo after paying both of them), keep ~$2400 saved to ensure I have enough money to move.

If you have any other suggestions I'd be willing to hear those as well :) (Am trying to get enough enough in school to pick up a part time job if I can)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Background info:**

So I'm a college student, with a $30/hour internship lined up to start this summer that will last until the end of the year.

Currently though... I'm sitting on ~$2900 of Credit Card debt. 

I filed my taxes and will be getting back a little over $2900 back total from Federal+State. I live at home so my living expenses are fairly cheap right now, I shouldn't accrue much more debt until summer if I pay this down. However I know I'm going to need upfront costs for moving into my apartment for this internship.

I'm going to be living in Boston, where I imagine a ""best case rent scenario"" would be finding 3 roommates and splitting rent so we pay ~$500/mo each plus some utility costs... however I'm afraid of a worst case scenario where I will have to live on my own and pay an atrocious rent over $1200 or something. I'm not very familiar with the COL in Boston.

I don't have an income currently due to the workload I have at school. So this is the first real money I've had in months and will be the only money I have (outside of my Credit Cards) until I go to Boston. If I can manage to pick up a part-time job between now and the summer I will, but this is my current situation.

personalfinance,Received tax refund even though owed for 2017 still,"Throwaway because my ex knows my username. Made the mistake of getting married to someone who had a significant amount of debt and didn't handle it properly.

When we filed married jointly in 2017 we owed $2400 in fed taxes. I set up a monthly payment plan that came out of my bank account. Husband and I split up in July and as part of the divorce agreement I said I would pay the rest of the taxes as a) they were coming out of my account anyway and b) I didn't trust him to do it.

In November he filed for bankruptcy and included the taxes on his list o' debts, however he noted that he owed $0 toward them according to court documents that I accessed. This filing, however, disrupted the autodebit from my account so I went to the IRS website and paid manually once I was able to figure out what was going on.

His debt was discharged in February but I know that it doesn't wipe out taxes. However, I filed for 2018 taxes as head of household and today got my full refund -- I assumed the refund would have gone toward the owed taxes from 2017 but it didn't.

Do I need to just turn around and dump this refund manually back to the IRS, or am I supposed to keep making payments? I don't want to get into some sort of trouble for receiving money that I shouldn't have, if I wasn't supposed to.

Thanks for any suggestions anyone can give me!

EDIT: Thanks for suggestions - I spoke with the IRS and will not be going to tax jail! Hooray!",finance

personalfinance,Bank Direct Deposited wrong amount for both my Federal and State Taxes.,"I filed my taxes with TaxAct this year and was approved to receive $1871.00 (Fed) and $567.00 (State, RI). My return is very simple as I don't have student loans or a mortgage or anything like that. I file 0 and have generally received refunds consistent with the numbers above in the past. I used direct deposit to receive the money and noticed that both of the refunded amounts are lower than what was quoted (with the TaxAct fees already taken into consideration). My question is, does this mean that I made an error in filing my taxes and they adjusted the refunds, or could there be a legitimate error on their end and I should figure out who to contact to dispute/resolve. I received $150.00 less than what was quoted for Fed and $482.00 less for State. Do I call the bank that made the deposit? Maybe start with the support team for TaxAct? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  
Edit: I contacted TaxAct's support and they gave me the number for the IRS. I'm going to try calling them on my lunch break.",finance

personalfinance,Just a Payment Processor,"A 3D printer was purchased from 3dprintersbay.com for over $1,000. The printer arrived defective; after a month of troubleshooting, test printing, and going back and forth with the merchant; they finally relented and allow for a return via an escalated claim under PayPal’s “Purchase Protection”...I’ll explain why there’re quotes around that term.

In order for me, the buyer to get the $1,000+ refund on the defective product shipped to me, I have to return it to the merchant. So far so good, I return the item as if I bought it from a local U.S. store and I get my money back. Sounds perfectly fair to me. But here’s the rub, the return address for the printer? It’s not the address provided on 3dprintersbay.com...nope, it’s an address in China.

The return shipping can’t be that much right? But it is friends! The cheapest quote was $786.60 from DHL; $866 via FedEx, and $814.38 via UPS.

So in order for me to get the refund from PayPal under its “Purchase Protection”, I have to spend roughly $800, or 80% of the product’s value to ship a faulty product back to the merchant that was suppose to be located in the United States. Say I spend the $800 and return it and get $200 back. PayPal has essentially allowed me to be scammed by this merchant out of $800.

I called PayPal and spoke with a supervisor who essentially told me there is nothing they can do other than to provide up to $30 for the return shipping…on a $800 return shipping charge. L O L They’re just a payment processor and that it’s between me and the merchant to come to an “understanding” and resolves the issue. I asked what’s the point of “Purchase Protection“ then? He responded and say that they send a message to the merchant and ask them for a response. In plain terms, they send emails between the merchant and buyer. Isn’t what I did, by myself for the past month with this particular merchant? Am I then providing my own purchase protection? I should really use that as a marketing gimmick!

The best thing the supervisor provided was PayPal’s legal department’s mailing address so I can then write a letter of explanation, and hope that someone will make an effort to research the situation and provide some sort of guidance? Perhaps even allow this poor old sod to sue PayPal in small claims court. Or in the most likely outcome, send a canned letter stating how it is PayPal policy, they’re just a payment processor, and that I’m just shit out luck…but we’ve got you to send the money to the merchant, and we’re so proud and good at that, so everything is a-ok!

Oh yes, I did look up the address (N Forest Rd E  
 Deerwood, MN 56444) after the fact, and the address listed on their website? It’s a USPS location... When I called the Minnesota Secretary of State to ask information about this business, they told me there is no such business in the state of Minnesota and that they’re essentially using a dummy address and are conducting business without a license; directed me to contact the BBB to file a complaint.

I called PayPal back with this new information I found to be extremely important. What was I told? Here’s $500, it’s the best we can do.

So PayPal allows a website that uses false information, happily provide its service as the payment gateway for this merchant, tells me that my $1,000+ purchase has “Purchase Protection” while in fact it couldn’t and wouldn’t do a damn thing to get all of my money back.

For a company that actively markets its Purchase Protection for buyers, and prides itself on offering secure payments, they really could give a rats ass about what happens to your hard-earned money after the fact.

personalfinance,Issue with credit score coming back as 0?,"UPDATE EDIT: we found out what the problem was. Apparently someone tried to open a line of credit or something in California (so across the entire country from us), and it was flagged as suspicious and the attempt was blocked but in the mean time they placed his account on hold or froze it, whatever the correct terminology is. I'm not sure what we have to do now, aside from him getting in touch with them confirming it wasn't him.. should we be concerned about his identity being stolen or anything? I'm so clueless about this stuff. Not good, I know. 

I hope this is the right place to post this. For reference we live in the US (Pennsylvania).

I was in and accident recently and my vehicle was totaled. We took the insurance money and decided to get a new vehicle. My credit score has always been just ""ok,"" in the mid-600's. My husband's score is not great, in the upper 500's but it's all medical bills. Literally the only thing weighing his down are medical bills. We pulled together a decent amount for a down payment and went up yesterday after work to apply as co-applicators. That way my credit score could be used and his income could be used. Anyway, long story short they ran our credit and mine came back as expected, but they said his came back as a zero. They said the only thing he had listed were nine medical bills. We ended up getting approved but his score being a zero is really bothering us. I was under the assumption that the lowest a score can be is 300. Do car dealerships use a different model or something? I'm about to have him pull up credit karma and check but I was told they aren't always accurate. I'm worried we're paying a higher interest rate because of his credit being zero. Any insight is really appreciated or if this isn't the right place to ask, is someone could point me in the right direction I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!

Also, I did read through the wiki and saw that FICO has different breakdowns, one specifically for Auto. what is the difference between a regular fico score and one specifically for Auto? I did not see anything at all about a score being able to be zero anywhere. Also I should mention that aside from the bad medical bill credit, he totally paid off a loan that was in his name last year, and is in very good standing with another loan right now so why isn't that showing up?",finance

personalfinance,"A question of priorities, or what would you do?","I have an auto loan that I've been paying on. I pay much more than the minimum payment on it and all of the extra goes to principal. The downside is that the interest rate is \~10%. I've posted in here before about refinancing it and decided that since I'm paying so much, that the refi won't be worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

* The auto loan is the only interest generating debt that I have.
* I'm current renting an apartment but working towards a goal of buying a house one day so I have a fund in YNAB for that
* I also have a 401k that I'm getting my employer match
* I also have a Roth IRA that I contribute to, but not much since I have the auto loan.
* My safety net is around 80% funded for \~6 months

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where the ""what would you do"" comes in:

As stated before, I currently pay a lot more on the car than is required as I am trying to pay that down. However, I *feel* like I should also put extra money into other funds, like the house fund, or my retirement/safety net funds.

&amp;#x200B;

Logically, I *know* that it makes sense to put more money into the auto loan since the interest on that is greater than what my current return is from the investments, and it's much better than the money that is sitting in my checking account making 0 interest at all.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, my car payment is $327.

* I've slated $1500 for next month's payment (last month was $1350)
* I slated $400 to my house fund (currently sitting at $1000)
* I slated $200 to my IRA
* put the rest into emergency fund.

While I'm fine with having the emergency fund funded, I'm not sure if I should take the other $600-1200 and just put it into my car payment or not. What would you do?",finance

* 26 paychecks per year
* Each paycheck is $1,923.08
* Each paycheck has $103.23 in Federal taxes
* Single, 2 allowances

Each allowance in 2019 is worth $4,200 and formula for non-taxed is $3,800 + $4,200 * allowances = $12,200. 

So $50,000 - 12,200 = $37,800, thus;

* $9,700 at 10% = $970
* $28,100 at 12% = $3,372

Total owed is $4,342. With only $103.23 per check being withheld, that's $2,683.98 in Federal taxes. Should I not be using the 2 allowances? The [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes) led me to believe that for a single person, that should be fine.",finance
personalfinance,529 Plan Penalties vs. Capital Gains tax,"I have been looking into avenues to save for my child. 

&amp;#x200B;

The 529 plan comes up a lot in my research and I see its benefits. However, one of my concerns is what my child ends up not going to college; I see there is a 10% penalty in addition to income taxes if 529 funds are not used for qualifying expenses. Obviously, I want my child to go to college, but in the event that does not happen, I still would like to have something saved up for them to start their adult life. 

&amp;#x200B;

So then I thought about stocks and this is where I get confused. The starting process seems easy enough: open a Vanguard account, set up a 90/10 stock/bond buying into an index fund, contribute an initial amount with yearly deposits and watch it grow over the next 18 years. However, what happens when I want to withdraw from it to give my child the funds? (Assuming they want/need the money and don't want to let it sit and continue to grow.) I keep seeing things about capital gains tax and I can't get a good grasp on what that is or how it works. Is that, along with income tax, something that would have to be paid when withdrawing?

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I could do a standard savings account, but it seems to make more sense to give the money an opportunity to grow beyond a 2% interest rate. (Assuming an online bank like Ally.)

I appreciate anyone's thoughts and opinions on this. I just want my daughter to have a good start to her adult life whether she goes to college or decides to do something else.",finance

personalfinance,Some tips for Turbotax that will save you a call to customer support,"When you call turbotax product support, there's a good chance that you're going to get answered by me (i work for them.) There's also a good chance I'm going to hear the same things that I've heard a billion times, but it's not entirely your fault. Here's some things that you should probably know before you get started. A lot of this is probably obvious, but hopefully it will help someone.

- You will almost *always* pay at least $40, even if you use the free version. The prices advertised on the products and pricing page don't make it readily apparent that those are *fed only* prices, and that the state return is an additional $39.99. Unless you're not doing a state return, add $40 to those prices on the product page that what youre really gonna be paying.

The Free Edition has a cutoff date for free state filing, which is **March 15th**. You will have to pay for your state if you're using the Free Edition after that date. Also if you're doing anything except the *simplest* W2, it's going to prompt you to upgrade to Deluxe. So don't expect to go all out with your credits and deductions on the Free Version. 

The only surefire way to pay $0 is to use Turbotax Freedom, if you qualify for it. Yes, *Turbotax Freedom* is different from the Turbotax Free Version.

- TurboTax Online charges you for tax prep, there are no fees for filing. Do not call for a refund if your return gets rejected, cause you're going to get some bad news...

- There is an *additional* $39 fee to have your TT fees taken out of your return. Someone people get this mixed up with the base TT Deluxe fee, but it's not. It's stacked *on top*. Do yourself a favor, just pay the TT fees straight up

- Free users have their return locked up around October, so they'll no longer be able to access their previous return if they used the free version *until* they pay for the current year's version. If you use any higher version than the Free version, your taxes will be unlocked forever. Just to recap..

**PLUS Upgrade, Deluxe, Premier, or Self Employed:** Your returns are available forever

**Free Version, no plus upgrade:** You have until **October 15** to access your return. Thats around the time the new TT will be released, and then you'll have to pay for one of the above to unlock them.

-  *Please* pay attention to your payment summary. I can't tell you how many people look at the payment summary, see exactly *what* and *how much* they're paying for, proceed to enter their credit card info, then immediately call us because they think they were charged too much. Stop. Clear and start over so you can downgrade to a cheaper TT, or call us so we can give you a service code to make it cheaper. Because after you pay, you're registering a *legal document being sent to the government* and won't be able to do either of those. It's harder to get Online fees refunded after the fact. Look at what you're paying for and make sure you're good with the price.

- We have no idea when your refund is going to hit, all we can tell you is if it's accepted or rejected. If you ask, we're going to tell you something that can be summed up as ""idk call the IRS lol""

That's all I got for now. I'm indifferent to whether you like TT or not but use this info to your advantage.",finance
personalfinance,Need help making a decision on a car purchase,"I have a 16 Chrysler 200 I bought new (yes I know, first mistake.) that has about 38000 miles on it. I take care of it, regular oil changes, tire rotations and such. It’s been a good car.

Now I work at a dealership and these things can be junk, I didn’t really consider this when I bought it, but now I’m starting to worry. Nothing is wrong right now, I’ll stress that.

So we got a WRX in the other day and it’s really nice, clean car. Its got about 50k miles on it, doesn’t need anything really, I’m driven it, and the shop has looked at it, it’s a fine car.

Now I’m considering buying it but don’t wanna make the same mistakes I made before.

 I’m about 8500 upside down on the 200, but on the flip side I could buy the 15 WRX for 17,500 which is well under book. We have it online for around 22k.

My credit has also gone up considerably, my old interest rate is 16-17% and my payment is 500. I’ve gone up almost 200 points since I’m at 670, and 680 on my credit karma.

I’ve told myself if I buy the Subaru I won’t buy it without an aftermarket warranty, which will cost me around 2k.

With the little math I’ve done to try and crunch my payment, I wind back up at 500.
Lowering my payment isn’t the issue, i can afford the payment I just don’t want to make a mistake, can someone from an outside view give me their 2 cents?

I do like the WRX for its style and look, but also they seem much more reliable. It’s AWD and I live in a state with a lot of snow. My car is not AWD.

Also my basic warranty for my car is up, I only have the power train left, and if I bought the WRX I would get an aftermarket warranty that would take me out 4 more years and 50k more miles.
The 200 does not hold its value well but I think it’s lost the biggest chunk of its value already.
The Subaru should hold it well.
Much better than the 200 already....

I have about $100,000 in a Marcus high interest savings account and usually contribute about $2000 a month to this account. My rate on this account is 2.25%. What are folks opinions about continuing to contribute to this account and just pay off the loan in one big payment ten or twelve years down the road, which should be possible along with company stock that will be vesting?

The interest rate is pitiful though (0.2%) so I've been considering moving the bulk of my current savings to somewhere it can stay relatively liquid but bring in some money. By relatively liquid, I mean I plan to use whatever investment vehicle for an eventual down-payment on a house AND/OR a place to keep money in the event I want to throw a large chunk at the market if we end up in a recession/bear market (buying the big dips).

I'd still have my local checking/savings account for paychecks and purchases (I have two credit cards with them and paying them off is easy through a single account).

The other option is to use investment vehicles through a Fidelity account (CDs? treasuries? Money market?).

The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(90d)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past 3 months. The column “Tx(90d)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last 3 months. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past 90 days, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

HOW I USE THIS: For the time being I am trying to keep things on the safe side. So I tend to go for the stocks that have success rate of 1.0, and more than 1 in Tx(90d), The Growth(90d) and Factor tell me how hot are the agents that are in charge of analyzing this stock are. Beyond this point, I also go for stocks with State equal to ready_to_buy because I make this to mean that the upwards tendency is just about to start so it has more potential to grow. State ready_to_sell isn't bad either, it just means that the system had detected the upward trend in previous days and it still thinks that the trend will continue this way. The system doesn't actually tell me how long the upwards tendency will be. I run the models everyday at noon NY time, so the programs just tells me: ""I think you should buy this TODAY"" or ""I think you should sell it TODAY"" Just as an added heuristic, I tend to sell all my stocks on Fridays because I don't like the uncertainty that weekends and long weekends bring, but that is just a personal opinion.",finance

personalfinance,Better to pay less on loans to put more in savings for the long-term?,"I am a recent graduate with around $45,000 in student loans. I am trying to figure out if it would be better to opt for the 25-year repayment plan rather than the 10-year so that more monthly income can be dedicated to investing and savings.

&amp;#x200B;

The 10-year would have a monthly cost of around $474 a month (end value of $59,640) and the Extended Fixed plan would be $252 a month (end value of $75,610). Or the Extended Graduated which would transition from $167 a month to $436 over the course of 25 years (ending with $82,685).

&amp;#x200B;

My thinking is this: would my savings and investing earn more compound interest before retirement if I went for the lower monthly student loan payment plans and divested the saved 250-to-300ish dollars to a savings/investing account? Or would it be better to put all into debt (I already have decent emergency fund saved) for the first ten years and then be able to save larger amounts until I retire?

&amp;#x200B;

Granted, I would pay more in loans but would the potential earnings for my savings be worth it?

I currently have about $35K of CC debt spread across multiple cards:

$11K with a 16% interest rate

$13K with 20%

$4K with 15%

$7K with 29%

I also have school loans:

$10K consolidated public loan with a fixed 5% interest rate

$9K private loan with 9.5%

Typical recurring expenses like rent, utilities, etc., add up to about $1200.

Income: $56K/year

Savings: $3K

Life Insurance: $3K (IUL, which I’m told I’m able to this money out if needed?)

Multiple 401Ks from past jobs add up to \~$30K

&amp;#x200B;

I’m a single woman in my mid-30s living in California. The majority of my income goes towards food and paying back my credit cards. I tend to be a bit frivolous with my other purchases, but I’ve scaled back a lot in recent months. However, I live in a tiny studio without a real kitchen, so I still spend a lot on eating out. I did get a promotion at work with a small pay bump.

One goal I have is that I would eventually like to move out of my current place and into a 1 bedroom. I would like to avoid living in a small studio again (though I don’t need much space) and I’m not interested in living with roommates again. (shudder) It looks like a place in a decent area in the lower price range would still be about $1300-1500. My car is paid off, but it’s not going to last too much longer. I’ll likely need to start looking for a replacement by the end of the year. 

I’m not behind on any payments. So far, things have been fine if I continue to pay my minimum but I worry that my higher balances will never go down because of interest charges and fees. For example, I looked at one statement recently and found that while I made a $200 payment, I was charged $130 in interest fees. 

This is a bummer to admit, but I went through a really rough, long period of my life from my early-20s until now where I didn’t care about responsibilities nor even value my own life. I didn’t care how much I spent, even when I was fully aware that I didn’t have the cash to pay it back. I didn’t make extravagant purchases, but I regularly spent more than I could afford. This is the reason for the majority of my credit card debt.

While it’s still a daily struggle, I want to be here now and I want to be better. I’m curious to get some help now on how I can better manage my finances moving forward. I’ve considered debt consolidation and bankruptcy but I haven’t looked too closely because the information is so overwhelming. I’m not sure if I could qualify or if it’s necessary. My credit score is average, but it would be amazing to wipe out those debts. Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Need advice for future planning and life insurance .,"My wife and I (mid 30's) have 2 kids (under 3 and thinking of having a third) and she makes 100k and I make 50k. We have a house that we owe 240k on. She has 150k in student loans and I have 5k left in student loans. We have 40-50k in various savings and checking accounts at any given time. We live in Washington state. She works in Washington, I work in Oregon.

I auto deposit into my works 401k. My wife has Traditional IRA's that I made for her with Vanguard. Because she's not interested in doing a 401k with her work because they don't match.

I have not started college funds for our kids yet and feel like it is something I should do, considering both of our parents were unable to.

I have also been wondering about life insurance and what kind we should get and how much we should get. My biggest worry is because she makes more money that if something should happen I would not be able to afford our current comfort of living which I feel is honestly fairly modest. So when it comes to life insurance I wonder if, the banks that are owed money for student loans get their due first, or if we the family do. Because honestly if something were to happen to either of us I just want the house to be taken care of so neither of use have to worry for our kids. 

I feel like my current plan is paying down her student loans aggressively for the next one to two years to bring down the overall balance down and just get rid of the higher interest rate ones. Then after that we are planning on moving to a bigger house in a less expensive area that hopefully maintains a similar mortgage payment. 

I also wonder what I should about my wife's retirement contributions. She is a lot less interested in planning for it than I am, but she is not opposed to me taking care of it. So at least for her current employment I am wondering if maxing a Traditional IRA + ROTH IRA might be the way to go for her.",finance

personalfinance,Review my investment/savings plan?,"Hi everyone. First I'll start of with that I am in my late 20s. I live in the SF area so everything is inflated here, and that buying a house doesn't seem like it's in my near future. I have a basic strategy that I've been sticking to for the last few years, but have never really questioned it or gotten feedback, so thanks in advanced for any comments. 

Here's my strategy, not including numbers. 

-I have no debt and keep 6 months living expenses in my savings (low interest payment from BoA and have been looking to switch)

-I max out my 401k to what the federal government allows

-I have a Roth IRA, but can no longer directly contribute to it because of my income. Though, I've been looking into backdoor contributions. 

-I participate in my companies stock purchase plan, and keep the stock for the minimum time to avoid short term income taxes, then sell. 

-All the rest of my money goes into my investment fund, which consists of 4 different domestics index funds that track the sp500 (vanguard, fidelity, etc). Maybe add some different funds here? International? I keep it fairly aggressive in these funds (i.e. no bonds, etc) since I'm still young. 

-Every month so, I go into my bank account and trim off what I don't need for my savings or very month or so, I go into my bank account and trim off what I don't need for my savings or for CC payments, and add that to my investment account funds. 

-I don't know what my plan is for retirement. I can see myself doing the corporate lifestyle and retiring at 60-65, and I also sometimes dream of living the FIRE lifestyle and retire at 35. I don't think it will change how I invest in the near term though, except for the possible real estate investment.

personalfinance,Best strategy to pay off student loans while still in grace period.,"Hi PF!

So just recently graduated and starting working, and wanted to know what the best approach is to save the most money for paying off my student loans.

I am doing the avalanche method and targeting my highest percentage loans first. I recently refinanced my private loans from two loans at ~$8500 each at around 7% - 9% down to one ~$17000 loan at 5.65% fixed. The rest of my loans totaling around ~$30,000 are spread across 6 subsidized federal loans and 4 unsubsidized federal loans at around 3% to 5% fixed.

I've set aside $1000 in my budget to attack my loans. I am possibly open to readjusting my budget sheet to allocate more funds to my loan (such as lowering my monthly deposit into my savings account).

My federal loans are in deferment until 06/15/2019. Basically, I narrowed down to what I believe are 3 options.

1. Use the deferment period to only tackle the refinanced loan of $17000. Then once the deferment period ends, pay the minimum on the federal loans until I pay off the 5.65% loan a la the avalanche method.

2. Use the deferment period to tackle the refinance loan of $17000 and the interest accrued on my unsubsidized federal loans. Then once the deferment period ends, pay the minimum on all of my federal loans until I pay off the 5.65% loan.

3. Traditional avalanche, where I pay the minimum (or interest accrued) on my federal loans, while putting the rest of my loan budget into the highest interest percentage loan.

Am I missing any other option here that can save me the most money?

Lastly, I can reduce my monthly payments of my federal loans from $315 down to $110 increasing the total repay estimated from $37,685 to $54,693. Will this repayment strategy help with any of the options listed above or should I keep it on the level repayment plan.

EDIT: I'm maxing out my employer 401k contribution as well as my HSA, and setting aside 10% of my income to my efund. Originally, I was going to set aside 20% until it covers 6 months of my expenses, but I was recommended to bring it down to 5% to 10% and tackle these loans. My monthly flex spending is around $1600, so I definitely have some wiggle room here but at the same time, I do want to set aside a discretionary fun budget.",finance

I'm living in California.

The past four years I've been working my ass off and I'm burnt out. I've been making 200k base salary and have deferred $50k per year into my company's non qualified deferred compensation plan. It was invested in the S&amp;P 500 and has grown to a ~250k balance. 

Outside the deferred comp plan I have $290k, $120k of that in taxable and rest in retirement accounts (401k/roth ira/hsa.) Vested private shares in my old employer (last 409a puts it at $150k). No debts. No real estate. So total net worth is about $540k ignoring employer shares.

I've decided to quit so now I have the option to take it as a lump sum payment or withdraw equal periodic payments up to 10 years. I can withdraw over 2 years if I wanted to. I can keep it invested for that time. At the end of my withdrawal period I've specified it pays out the balance as a lump sum. No options to delay taking any lump sums. **Once this choice is made it's irrevocable other than becoming disabled or a few other catastrophic exceptions.**

Withdrawals count as ordinary income - so I'd be paying w2 fica taxes, fed income and state income taxes. Fica taxes are due on the whole balance this year I quit as by quitting it's the balance is no longer at substantial risk of forfeiture. Fica will be paid automatically. The $250k is after fica taxes. Unfortunately, even though I'm paying fica taxes on it, this income does not count as earned income so I can't then stuff that earned income into a 401k or IRA/etc. 

My annual expenses are about $50k including health insurance. I don't have any plans to move out of CA in the next five years. I don't want to move just for taking one year off just to dodge CA state taxes.

### Option 0: Lump sum &amp; still work at similar compensation:          
$80k federal taxes at 32% marginal rates, $23k CA state taxes at 9.3% marginal rates:        
$103k taxes paid.       
$147k balance left over, invested over 10 years at 7%: $289k      

### Option 1: Lump sum &amp; taking time off for one year:           
$60k federal, $20k state taxes:       
80k total taxes paid(23k tax savings)     
50k annual expenses          
$120k balance left over, invested over 10 years at 7% is: $236k.     

### Option 2: Take time off over two years:        
$21k/year federal(42k total), $8.8k/year state(17.6 total):      
59.6k total taxes paid      
saving 20k taxes from option 1 ($43.4k total taxes saved).     
Two years of expenses is $100k.            
$90k balance left over, invested over 10 years at 7%: $177k      

### Option 3: Keep working, payments over 10 years - $25k/year, balance due at 10 years.    

Same taxes paid as option #1. Subject to risk of future tax law changes. Could go up or down depending on if I'm married, tax politics, move, etc. 

If I keep working I'd invest that $25k/year. At 32% fed tax + 9.3% state tax I'd pay $10,325 at marginal tax rates, leaving $14,675 to be invested in a taxable account a year. Over 10 years that'd be a taxable account balance of $217k + the estimated $128k in the non-qualified plan for a total value of $345k.

# Final Thoughts

Career wise, I don't think anyone will blink an eye at me for taking one year off. I think taking anything over two years off will risk my career too much.

The tax dog is wagging its tail at me. Obviously from the strictest financial sense doing the 10 year payments and investing that will lead to the greatest outcome, plus possibility of getting out of California in the next 10 years, further boosting returns. Taxes can also go down substantially if I get married in that time frame too.

But on the other hand, I essentially got ~26k extra from the tax savings with the payout being my only income. So in a way taking a year off is almost equal to the same balance if I never participated in the plan. In a way it's like the government is subsidizing me to take a year off, which is extremely attractive. 

All the above is completely ignoring opportunity cost from an extra's year income which would be $95k before tax including deferred comp or ~$74k tax adjusted if the new employer I find doesn't have deferred comp. Either way I'm burnt out of this job and will be quitting to say the least, and take some money off the table so the deferred comp isn't at risk anymore.

1. Make a $4000 down payment and finance the remaining $2000 at around 4.4% apr. I will be able to pay it off faster than just the minimum payments. This makes the most sense to me because I would like to avoid taking on too much new debt.

2. I just got a new credit card with 0% apr for 15 months so I was thinking instead of financing the car, paying the $2000 with that and paying it the same way I would in option 1 but without the interest. I have only ever used credit cards to boost my credit. I never go over 10% utilization and never carry a balance. I am confident I could pay this off before the 15 months are up but I am worried about my credit taking a hit from the sudden balance increase.

3. I also have about $8000 owed in student loans, around $3000 of which are at 6.4% apr. I'd like to pay those ones off asap. Would it make more sense to use the money I would spend on the down payment to pay those and then take on more car debt at a lower interest rate?",finance
personalfinance,Why am I being charged interest?,"With seemingly no change in my behavior, I'm now being charged interest on my credit card.  I intend to call them and ask about it, but before I do, I want to get things straight.

I've got several credit cards, but one is my ""main"" card that I use for all but a few select expenses.  The cards that do get a charge here and there are paid off in full, but my main card might carry a bit more of a balance. Typically this is just a couple of hundred each period, give or take.

January and February are typically months where I carry a larger balance than most months, and I've been charged interest for the last two months.  The thing is that my payments have been more than the rolling balance, so I thought I shouldn't be charged any interest.

Example

$1000 opening balance =&gt; $3200 charges =&gt; $3000 payments =&gt; $1200 closing balance

My understanding was that any payment went to the previous balance first, then would be applied to charges from the current period.  Also, my understanding was that charges only accrue interest when they are unpaid for more than one billing period.

This is effectively how I've been managing this card for more than a year now, more or less doing exactly as I laid out.  Typically it's with a smaller rolling balance, but there's always some balance from month to month and the payments are always more than the prior period's balance.

Is there something I'm missing?  Am I maybe out of a promotional interest period?  This period that just closed I was charged about $60 on a $1600 balance, which seems like a crazy high interest rate, even for a credit card.

EDIT: So after a bit of digging, here are the terms on how the card calculates interest.

&gt;We use the daily balance method (including current transactions) if the Balance Subject to Interest Rate is
followed by (D). We figure the interest charge by multiplying the daily balance by its daily periodic rate each day in the billing period. To get a daily balance, we take the balance at the end of the previous day, add the interest on the previous day’s balance and new charges, subtract new credits or payments, and make
adjustments. The Balance Subject to Interest Rate is the average of the daily balances...
 
&gt;How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases. Your due date is at least 23 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you interest on purchases if you pay your New Balance by the due date each month. If you do not pay your New Balance by the due date each month, you will pay interest on your purchases from the date they’re posted to your account until you pay such amount in full for two billing periods in a row.

So with that in mind, it looks like in January, the full December balance was not paid by the due date (ironically, a $2000 payment posted the day after).  This kicked off charges getting daily interest, and now, even paying in full will not negate the interest due to the charges accruing daily interest since posting.  It says that it requires paying the new balance in full for two months to stop accruing interest, and I believe that both January and February were both paid in full.  I think think that means I should not be charged any more interest, but I think I should double check on that.",finance
personalfinance,Question about student loan.,"Before I submit the application, they are showing me possible loan terms. The range of interest rates they are offering is 4.625% - 12.50%. They let will let me know the exact rate once I submit. It's a variable rate that depends on the one-month LIBOR rate.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the length: ""Principal and interest repayment terms vary from 5 to 15 years and are based upon the borrower's cumulative outstanding Sallie Mae owned or serviced private student loan balance, repayment option and the student's school-certified academic grade level. ""

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I don't understand:   ""Your rate will be calculated each month by adding a margin between 2.000% and 9.875% to the LIBOR rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of one percent (0.125%).""

&amp;#x200B;

How do they decide how much they will add to the LIBOR? Sounds like they can just decided to add what they want. This is for a 6 month, non-credit course, which is why I didn't get federal aid. It's $9500. What rate would be too high? Thanks",finance
personalfinance,Should my mother rollover her TSP to a Roth ?,"Writing for my mother, because she broke her hand. 

Here is my mothers situation:
She turns 64 next month, and retired in 2008. She was a civil servant and receives a pension of $52,000 per year, and alimony of $7,500 per year (ending next year). She has about $25,000 in a Vanguard brokerage account for stocks, another $15,000 or so in a Vanguard Roth IRA my cousin helped set up for her, about $10,000 cash. Owes $75,000 on a house and $20,000 on a car that she will have all paid off by 70. She has a TSP balance of $245,000 as of this week. 

We are wondering if she should roll the TSP over to a Roth IRA account and pay the taxes now, probably about half this year and half next year. 
The reasons we think this is a good idea:
- My mom doesn't think she needs the RMD's from the TSP at 70.5. She will have no debt, and will be drawing about $4,000 monthly after tax from pension. She doesn't spend alot normally. She pays $1,300/month to the house and car payment now, and still saves $1,000/month. But the time RMD's come around, she will likely be saving $2,300/month on average before any distribution. 
- The Roth will grow tax free (after we pay of course), and we will be able to use it for nursing home / medical if needed. She is very worried about this; she doesn't want to be a burden.  
- The federal tax rate is low right now, but we expect the rate to rise when/if Dems take over in 01/2021.
- The TSP just doesn't offer alot of variety. It is low cost, but we'd be moving to Vanguard and I think the variety outweighs the small extra costs. 

We are concerned about:
- Is it ""too late"" for her due to age? 
- Is there a real advantage to doing the rollover, or are we hurting her position? Is it generally always better to be in a Roth?
- Does market position matter when making a move like this? We're at a pretty high point, so if we make the move and it falls, are we in bad shape compared to if we just kept the TSP? I'm not sure where the market is matters, but would love some input on this. 

Any input would be incredibly helpful! Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,"My Disorderly House, and Options","Hello. Thank you for reading about my predicament. I hope to hear helpful criticism. 

I just moved and bought a new car. My credit utilization has shot up, and my score has slumped 60 points. I'm living in two states but working in one. I have a decent job now, and just got a promotion. I've been trying to work 1 day a week overtime at 1.5x pay. I've cut expenses this month, majorly. Specifically:

$7500 cc debt at a whopping 29% interest. 11,100 ceiling and that's after asking for an increase. Minimum is $177
$33k car loan at 1.9% apr : $540/month.
Rent is $500/month
Car insurance : $150/month. 
Cell : $100/month

I now make $17.80 an hour working fulltime. Really good benefits, a shuttle to work, finally a decent job. 
I have $400 in savings.
My credit is about 680 now. Down from 750ish. 

My options, as I see it, are any of the following:

1. Open a new credit card. My utilization will go down, but unless it's a $10,000 card, not by much. 
2. Take out a small personal loan. $10000 ought to do it. Use that to pay off the majority of my credit card and then pay itself off. (Also I figure banks won't loan less than that, though I've not done the research)
3. Ask to lower my interest rate on the credit card. I've had the card for years and they recently upped my limit without my knowledge and then I upped it again. 7, then 9, now 11. 
4. Stay the course and keep building savings and such while making enough cc payments to cover interest. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated. By my rough calculations, I should net about $1000 a month if I stay the current course. 

Thank you all again for reading. I've been on this sub on my main account for weeks now and seen nothing but help from this community and I hope you all can help me out.

personalfinance,Trying to Take a Mortgage Out for Parents,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a situation that is a little unique and needs a little background. My brother and I are trying to buy a home for our parents and us to live in. We both saved up for a down payment and are preparing to get a mortgage for a house. We currently have $12k saved up for the down payment/fees. I know this is a meager amount for a home purchase, but it's what we have to work with.

The reason for the move is that my parents currently pay around $1,100 in rent and $60 for storage per month in their current living situation. We did some math and found that purchasing a home with a mortgage would be anywhere from $650 to $800 incl. taxes, home insurance, and mortgage insurance (if applicable) per month. We have a list of homes from $35,000 to $95,000 that fit our criteria. Our down payment percentages range from 10.5% to 28.6%. With adjustments for higher utility costs, we found that they'd still save a minimum of $100 to $200 per month in this arrangement and they can get rid of the storage unit they have.

My income is about $30,000 and my brother's income is around $3,795.02 from the National Guard. I am a fresh college graduate and he is still in school. In addition, my credit score is 580 due to a few late payments from school loans that I didn't realize had already used up their grace period from a previous gap year during my own schooling. I have paid all negative balances and I am grinding away at it, but the late payment marks remain on my credit (where they will for 7 years or so I am told). We cannot include my parents on the mortgage or their income because their credit has been shot to shit due to some hard times with a foreclosure and they make enough to just get by with rent and food. So we are reliant on my income, which I feel will be judged to be insufficient for a mortgage.

In these circumstances, would we be able to be approved for a mortgage? What can we do to improve our chances? I am told from a friend that it is likely we will get one for the high down payment percentage homes, but that $35,000 home is a really a last resort for us. We're hoping for something in the $65,000 to $80,000 range. To top it all off, the lease ends on their current place in July so we can't just wait and save up more without staying another year.

As for what I've done to try to improve our chances. I did get approved for my first credit card and will try to use that to get to that minimum of 620 credit score, which I hear is the minimum for mortgages.

Basically, what avenues should I attack here? Should I mostly focus on improving my credit? How would I do that? Should we leverage my brother's military status to see if we can get some type of veteran loan that won't affect his GI Bill for school benefits? I know there are no-doc mortgages, but I heard the interest rates amount to extortion and would make it worse than renting.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Sorry, if this seems jumbled, but I am panicking a bit because I am afraid we won't be able to pull it off. I am also not very experienced in this stuff since I am just fresh out of school. All I know is how to pay rent and food costs so I have a little beer money left. So any helpful advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Fixed some grammar and sentence structure.

EDIT 2: Formatting.

UPDATE/ADDITIONAL INFO: I am and will be living with my parents for a few years as I pay off school debts. They make enough for rent, food for me and my brother as well as little spending money for my brother in school. Despite their foreclosure and terrible credit, they do make $34k, sometimes even $40k per year.",finance
personalfinance,"Student Loan Repaid, Garnishment still happening.","I was stupid and let my Student Loan go into default.  About $6800.  Knowing I messed up, I had no problem letting the garnishment take place. I understand that the government works slow (Part Time Military), but my loan balance was $32 (according to the Federal Website, $22 principal, $10 interest ) two pay checks ago and they are continuing to pull 15% (between $200-400) every two weeks.

personalfinance,Should I invest $5k or use it to pay student loans?,"I have about $5k-$6k that I saved up this last year and a half. I live at home with my parents and have a pretty good paying job. Next year when I have my masters I’ll be making even more, while living rent-free with the parents. However I have about $30k in student loans that I owe. I won’t have to start paying until after I graduate from grad school.

My mom has 3 investment properties that pay for expenses and whatnot and she’s looking to get a 4th. I said I would invest with her, but I’m wondering if I should just pay my loans off? I used to really panic about loans because of the ridiculous interest rate and I could completely pay off my highest interest rate loan which is about $4k... is it worth it? Or is investment the way to go?

If the property investment doesn’t work out, what should I do with the money? I’m curious to learn about stocks or something.

[EDIT: I feel this is worth mentioning. I work as a schoolteacher, and honestly I love my job, I can see myself doing it for years. Many programs exist that help teachers pay off their loans if they work for 10 years while making the minimum payment on the loans; these federal programs pay the rest of the balance after those minimum payments have been made. I didn’t mention this at first because tbh I don’t wanna jinkx how much I like my job but this is another reason why I’m thinking to invest. I ideally want to stop worrying so much about loans and am kind of optimistic that we are heading to a future that will forgive student debt, but you never know.

personalfinance,Alarming wake up call from first tax filing,"So a little background, I'm 24 yo and I come from a wealthy family so even with the summer jobs, etc. I've worked in the past I've never done my own taxes.  I always found this kind of annoying and requested last year that our CPA not do my taxes so that I could do my own taxes instead.  Also I graduated college last year so 2018 was my first year with a ""real"" income.

As I'm going through TurboTax last night and entering my W-2 info I start to realize that I had ZERO money held back from my paychecks for federal or state taxes.  I made around 40k last year and now owe about $5300 in taxes!!  Luckily I have saved up some money but it is going to nearly wipe me out to a net zero.

It's been tough for me to realize. I have made every effort to NOT rely on my families money and instead budget on my own and refuse any help that they offer financially.  The problem is that I was budgeting for a fairly larger income than I actually should have been making.

Who normally sets these with-holdings?  Did I fuck up by not making sure that they were in place or should my employer have brought this to my attention?  Not that it really matters I'm kind of stuck either way but just curious.

Any advice in this situation would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Using 401k to pay off credit card debt and raise credit scores,"So after looking at the wiki, I think my issue is a little more complex than just ""do it"" or don't do it"",  I’m thinking I need to ask for advice from y’all.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are looking to buy a new house in the next year or so. Our credit scores combined in Credit Karma are around 600 (which sounds like that means in the mid-500s if I’m reading everything correctly). Lenders are not willing to approve a mortgage until we can get our credit scores up.  They mention our credit card debt as a main issue.

&amp;#x200B;

We have around $10k in credit card debt (all cards essentially maxed out). We are on an ARM mortgage which is killing us right now. Our monthly payments are around $1600/month. We are paying for our daughter’s apartment while she is in college (another $1300/month). We are paying for 2 cars at a much higher interest rates than we should be paying. Income-wise, we are clearing around $150k/year.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these issues combined are making it difficult to try and get rid of a bunch of this CC debt.

&amp;#x200B;

We would like to begin to raise our credit scores as quickly as possioble so that we can possibly refinance our cars to get better rates to lower payments, and then keep up all payment to eventually sell our house. House is currently worth between $160k to $170k. We have about $60k in equity and would like to roll as much of that into the purchase of a new house.

&amp;#x200B;

We think the fastest, most effective way to begin this process is to zero out our credit card debt. I am thinking about taking out a loan from my 401k to get this done. It will essentially combine all cc debt into one payment with much lower interest. Loan will be paid off in 24 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of you say to never take a loan from 401k, but we’re having trouble keeping up. Almost all cards will be destroyed (but accounts left open) once this is done. We don’t want to fall back into the same trap.

&amp;#x200B;

Our ultimate goal is to get our credit scores up to lower interest on anything we can to lower payments.

&amp;#x200B;

Are we missing something? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(90d)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past 3 months. The column “Tx(90d)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last 3 months. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past 90 days, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

HOW I USE THIS: For the time being I am trying to keep things on the safe side. So I tend to go for the stocks that have success rate of 1.0, and more than 1 in Tx(90d), The Growth(90d) and Factor tell me how hot are the agents that are in charge of analyzing this stock are. Beyond this point, I also go for stocks with State equal to ready_to_buy because I make this to mean that the upwards tendency is just about to start so it has more potential to grow. State ready_to_sell isn't bad either, it just means that the system had detected the upward trend in previous days and it still thinks that the trend will continue this way. The system doesn't actually tell me how long the upwards tendency will be. I run the models everyday at noon NY time, so the programs just tells me: ""I think you should buy this TODAY"" or ""I think you should sell it TODAY"" Just as an added heuristic, I tend to sell all my stocks on Fridays because I don't like the uncertainty that weekends and long weekends bring, but that is just a personal opinion.",finance

And it's [not](https://imgur.com/a/Ona0RZk) just that. Every [one](https://imgur.com/gallery/HWSHuqt) of my [loans](https://imgur.com/a/N0X0EPE) is being [overpayed](https://imgur.com/a/TtjdSik). And yet my 460 dollar loan with 4.41% interest rate is gathering as much interest as my 2700 dollar loan with 4.41% interest rate. 

Can someone help me understand what the hell is going on here? Am I overpaying or is my math was off?

As an added bonus I calculated out how much I should be [paying](https://imgur.com/a/3c2tHed ) through the entire loan by averaging the 5 percentages and applying it. It's going to be a little off because those percentages should still only apply to it's loan but it shouldn't make too much of a difference with percentages this small. I should be paying around 11690 dollars give or take over the life of the entire loan but if you add each individual loans final amount you end up with 12444 dollars. 

So can someone whos smarter than me tell me what is going on? Is my math off or should I get my pitchforks? Thank you to anyone taking the time to read.",finance

personalfinance,Is the usage of credit cards (as long as you pay back at the end of the month) the single best way of improving your credit score quickly?,"I recently moved to the US and opened a credit card recently. I am planning to buy a house in autumn this year so I need to get (my currently non-existent) credit score as quick as possible until then.

&amp;#x200B;

The banker told me that the single best way is to use that new credit card as frequently as possible - meaning make the rent, utility, grocery bills all with your credit card and make sure to pay to zero until the end of the credit month. That heavy throughput should accelerate my credit score as much as possible according to the banker.

&amp;#x200B;

Is that accurate? I have a 1.5% cashback on my card and most rent and school fees are 3% credit card fee so I will be paying  \~40 USD per month for the privilege of using my credit card (opposed to bank account directly) in order to grow my score. Is that a reasonable trade of if I would get a better interest rate for my mortgage loan in autumn because of a better credit score?",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage pay down advice,"I currently have a 1 year adjustable mortgage at 5%.  I have enough money to pay off at least half of it and I plan to do so. I also want to re-finance to something with a smaller interest rate, but keep paying the same monthly payment that I am currently paying.  

If I make a large payment before I refinance, (as I said about 50%) is there any sort of early payoff fee for doing so?  Also, how do they determine the early payoff fee?  Like if I were to pay off 90% of the loan now, but then stretch the rest of the payments to the end of the term, is the fee based on what is left owed at the time of payoff or some other value?

So to keep this as short as possible, I reside in Ontario, Canada and have recently been reassessed for a 2014 tax return owing major penalties ($2500 provincial, $2500 federal, interests etc. up to $8,500) I filed 2014-2016 in one go, i admittedly put it off for a bit.

I had my parent's accounting friend file 2014, 2015 and 2016 for me, which she completely left out a t4 and didn't claim $25,000 worth of income for 2014. I immediately discovered the mistake and sent the CRA a copy of the missing T4 figuring I'd be reassessed for the return, but it never came. 2 years later, this morning I received a reassessment saying I owe the CRA $8478 by March 14.

Obviously, I panicked and called right away. They said the case is still under review until mid April, and that it shows I did send in a copy of the missing T4 asking for it to be reviewed.

Has this happened to anybody else?

I'm self employed this year and making under $40k, and in the past have never made over $45k/year. I'm still paying off student debts, I saved enough and then some for my tax return this year as a self-employed person...but I'll end up owing over $16k with this reassessment this year.

How am I expected to be able to pay these penalties without starving?

About 2.5 years ago, I got married and we bought our first house. A  few months back we separated. 

We had an FHA mortgage with only 3% down, but scored a great interest rate of 3.75%, but there is PMI insurance

The house cost $130k, and we now have \~12k in equity.  I've done a few improvements, but a couple other repairs are needed. (maybe 3k worth) If I were lucky, I could get $140k for the house. (I'm guessing) Minus the 6% going to a realtor, split 2 ways, that leaves each of us with a whole lot of not much money to move, find a new place, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I make substantially more money, and could pay for the house myself. She doesn't want the house, I kinda do (mostly for the garage), but I'm not that attached. The mortgage is way lower that what rent for a comparable / smaller place would be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does it make sense for me to keep the house? Should I sell it, buy myself a smaller place?  I've found some decent places on Zillow for substantially less that I'd be ok with, but the interest would be higher. Should I keep it for a short time, get the repairs finished, build a little more equity, then dump it?

I said no the dollar is a fiat currency and isn’t backed by anything other than the fact people perceive it as value etc. Keep in mind we are having this exchange in front of the whole class because I objected during his lecture.

Prince Francesco Boncompagni-Ludovisi is the son of the recently deceased Prince Nicolo and he has been arrested for tax evasion and commercial fraud. Prince Francesco is a blood drinking psychopath. The Ludovisi coat of arms uses a golden dragon as a symbol and their Pope Gregory XIII's coat of arms is displayed at the Vatican Museum. Gold and dragons are symbols for imperialism and the gold dragon is also on the Greek royal family's coat of arms. The Ludovisi family's ancestors were likely the Isaurian Dynasty of the Byzantine. Sauri is an Italian word for lizard. Gold finances empires. Pope Gregory XIII or Ugo Boncompagni purchased the Duchy of Sora for his family to govern over. The Boncompagni family frequently married in with the Sforza and Chigi families and through marriage with the Ludovisi family established the current Boncompagni-Ludovisi line.

The Casalesi Mafia are believed to be one of the wealthiest Camorra clans. Police have seized billions of their assets and estimate their overall earnings around 30 billion. These larger earnings go to their owners. The name Bon-Compagni means ""Good Company"" or ""Good Fellows"" since Compagno is translated to fellow in English. Boncompagni is where the term Goodfellas derives from which means a gangster or made man in the Italian Mafia. They made a major Hollywood movie glorifying the Italian Mafia called Goodfellas.

The attached analysis, entitled PROJECT MEGIDDO, is an FBI strategic assessment of the potential for domestic terrorism in the United States undertaken in anticipation of or response to the arrival of the new millennium.

For over four thousand years, MEGIDDO, a hill in northern Israel, has been the site of many battles. Ancient cities were established there to serve as a fortress on the plain of Jezreel to guard a mountain pass. As Megiddo was built and rebuilt, one city upon the other, a mound or hill was formed. The Hebrew word “Armageddon” means “hill of Megiddo.” In English, the word has come to represent battle itself. The last book in the New Testament of the Bible designates Armageddon as the assembly point in the apocalyptic setting of God’s final and conclusive battle against evil. The name “Megiddo” is an apt title for a project that analyzes those who believe the year 2000 will usher in the end of the world and who are willing to perpetrate acts of violence to bring that end about.

I could really use your help and expertise. Last year I worked for the VA and they screwed up my W-2, making it look like I received about $10K more in wages than I really did. I didn't notice it and didn't really think of it when filing, so I filed, and for the first time, I owed at the end of the year. ""Whatever, has something to do with the big tax changes that happened in 2018."" I filed electronically via TurboTax and set up a stupid payment plan thing via the same and moved on with my life.

About 10 days later I got a revised W-2 in the mail from the VA basically saying ""oops, our bad."" Now I'm trying to file an amended return via Turbotax but keep getting this message below. I previously saw this message a week ago, but it said the Form 1040X would be available on 2/22/19...now the date's been moved back:

""It looks like your federal return can't be amended right now. This is a nationwide delay for all returns like yours, no matter who's preparing them. You're going to have to wait until the tax form for amending a return (Form 1040X) is ready for processing. Form 1040X will be ready on 03/07/2019.""

personalfinance,Debit cards can be a valid option.,"Although I'm more partial to using a credit card for rewards purposes, there are plenty of cases I may choose to use a debit instead and logically so. Surcharges can often be charged for using a credit vs a debit card. In these cases, I may choose to use a debit card instead to avoid extra charges. Some places only accept debit over a credit card. Some people do better keeping track of finances with a debit card vs a credit card. Both offer fraud protection as well with banks having entire departments dedicated to security and fraud protections.

Here's what I do to **all** my cards since they all need to be used with caution/discretion. I set up card controls. Many modern banks, credit unions, and credit card companies offer this option. I can literally freeze my card so that it can't be used at any given time if I'm not out and about or plan on using it anytime soon. I can limits how much can be charged, set real time alerts, control ""where"" it may be charged, when, etc. Card controls are pretty clutch.

Additionally, I don't keep any amount of money in my checkings more than absolutely neccessary. Not just because of a debit card, but because anyone can get access to your checkings account info period and keeping too much money there isn't too wise not only because it makes it easier to access your money, but the interest rates **tyically** are much **lower** than savings anyhow. So it wouldn't make sense for interest purposes either. Shadier banks and CU's may offer HYCA's, but they are typically with banks/CU's with less resources, more questionable security/interfaces, and have a ton of extra hoops to jump through. Not worth the extra security risk for me.

Keeping most of your money in higher interest vehicles (like HYSA's/investments) grants more money. Also, there is usually no need to ever give out your savings account info and it can even be kept at a seperate bank if need be. Both a cc and debit card offer fraud protections and can be reimbursed during investigations. Be careful with botha cc and debit card, because if found to be at fault in either case you can lose a claim and be responsible. What people often don't talk about is the ability to spend limits past what you have on a credit card and be responsible for if losing and debit cards can be overdrafted if you don't have overdraft protection disabled (you should). 

This is in response to a post that says never use a debit card as if they don't also offer protections or can't be used responsibly. They can make a reasonable option as well for your circumstances. I have been using and will continue to use them for my own uses. Go with what works for you and be responsible with each option as you can be screwed with either. It isn't a ""you can only use **this** or you're wrong"" type of deal. Both can be viable and I thought I'd share some methods to help protect yourself from theft period be it credit or debit. 

Hope this helps and stops the blanket statements going around. Good day!",finance

Even though my money situation is starting to improve, I still don’t have enough to cover all the past due amounts, late fees, interest charges that are constantly building. I’ve tried to throw payments in here and there when I have extea money, even if isn’t there he full minimum amount due, but it still doesn’t seem like that’s making any dents.

As of today my credit score is a 492. Which is absolutely positivity not a good place to be at all! I was honestly expecting much worse. I was sick at my stomach and fearful it would be in the 300’s. Honestly it made me somewhat optimist and less hopeless about being able to overcome this horrible debt beast. And I’m going to beat it once and fore-all. I know I can! Even though I made some downright stupid decisions that led me here, I still like to think that I’m a smart, independent woman. I just need to put a plan in force and execute this monster. 

Here is my currently financial accounts, currently debt balance, and what’s required to bring them current, as well as a few miscellaneous things from my credit report.

•Auto Loan - Remaining Balance $4600 (monthly payment $150). Paid current till 3/15

•Express Credit Card - Limit of $1600 - Current Balance $2062.91 - Minimum due to pay current $350 (made payment of $50 today).

•**Marathon Gas CC - Limit of $600 - Current Balance at $1472.86 (payment of $50 made today). 

•Victoria’s Secret CC - Limit of $800 - Current Balance $837 - Account is in good standing, paid current. Next payment is $40 due on 3/6.

•Discover CC - Limit of $3000 - Current Balance $3089 - Minimum due to bring current $165

•Credit One Bank VISA CC - Limit of $400 - Current Balance $671 - Minimum due to bring current $96. (Payment of $40 made today). 

•**Chase MC CC - Limit of $2400 - Current Balance 2.903.65 - Minimum due to bring current $541

**The credit accounts starred have been closed as of recently. I’m still continuing patents. 

I also have to 3 bills in collections. One from a returned rent check (total $1506), ER bill ($270), and Tike Warner Cable ($149). 

I know the simple fix is to just pay the damn bills, After the payments I made today process, I will have about $100 left until I get paid again on the 28th, which is more than enough to last me. I would go ahead and pay more towards these balances but I don’t want to take a chance of getting stranded out somewhere with nothing. 

I wish I was able to say that my next paycheck would be enough to pay all the minimums required to bring everything current, but unfortunately that’s not the case. I get paid on the 15th and the last day of each month. Each paycheck is right around $1,055, and after I pay rent ($500) and insurance ($100) on the first I’ll only have a little over $400 left. I’m honestly not sure how I’m going to ever be able to swing getting caught up. With the late and interest fees that are occurring I feel like a cat chasing its own tail. 

I get calls all day, everyday from numbers all over the US regarding my past due balances. I never answer. I’ve always been absolutely terrified to talk to them. Now I’m kind of kicking myself in the butt for not doing so. Could they of helped me with a plan to get on track? If so, is it too late now? And if they are able to help what would the fine print include? Where should I even begin here...? 

Good news is I do have one account playing in my favor. I was in a bad car accident -hit by a drunk driver - a few years back.All said was done after medical bills were paid I was able to pocket about $65,000. At the time I was living at home still and my parents still paid everything. I literally didn’t have a single bill. Nor did I ever I think in a million years that I’d end up broke and in debt. Since I didn’t need the money at the time nor did I want it available at my disposal to blow, so I put it in a 6 year CD and planned to use it for a down payment for a house down the road. It was a special rate offer with a pretty good interest rate l (averages about $116 earned interest each month), so I’d hate to forfeit the rate plus pay early surrender fees, but it could potentially be the best possible avenue.

I’m getting married in December. I know this fix is going to take much longer than that, but I want to be sure I at least have a good handle on this and actively deceasing my debt ratio by then. After that day, we’re tied together. My problems become his and vise versa. I want to give the man of my dreams the best possible start financially that I can. I know I fucked up and I’m already beating myself up for doing so... so please, only constructive criticism and suggestions.

**Edit - I failed to mention this above. But I can take cash the CD’s interest ($1200) without an early withdrawal fee. So that chunk should be considered too.",finance

personalfinance,(US) Tax Calculator/IRA Calculator Question,"Looks like I'm going to owe an additional ~$350 in federal taxes this year. Is there a calculator out there that will tell me exactly how much I would need to contribute to an IRA to offset my tax bill.  I've been contributing to a roth for most of the year and have yet to max it out (hopefully by tax day). 

This is the first year I haven't been able to pay very little in federal tax.  I'm earning twice as much this year as previous years and as much as I'd like to reduce my tax liabilities further (and getting a refund) the thought of writing additional check to the fed is psychologically frustrating.   

TLDR
Should I continue to contributing to my Roth IRA as planned or should I open a traditional IRA to make myself feel better about my tax bill. If the latter is there a calculator out there to give me the exact amount to contribute.",finance

personalfinance,Can my parents claim me as a dependent on their taxes as a 23yr old college graduate still living at home?,"A little background:

I am 23 years old (turning 24 March of this year). I graduated from college December of 2017. I am still living under my parents roof (married for 20+ years and filing jointly), eating 2 square meals a day and paying no rent. I cover all of my personal expenses (car payment, insurance, phone, etc) along with any other daily expenses. I bounced around between jobs last year but ended up grossing just under 30K working most of the year as a kitchen manager at a local chain resturant and as an IT Support Specialist for an MSP.

My student loans kicked in June of 2018 and I have been making double payments in an attempt to reduce that debt as quickly as possible. 

I want to help my parents out during this tax season because they have been so good to me throughout going to university and helping me get my feet under me after graduation. I'm unsure of how qualifying dependents work under the new tax laws but I'm hopeful they can claim me and get a little more back than they would without claiming me as a dependent.

I guess my question to this sub is can I be claimed by my parents and if so, what would my parents be recieving instead of myself?

Also, as a side note, while working for the previously mentioned MSP during the early months of 2018 that job required a lot of driving between clients that wasn't paid for by my employer. I'm a little unsure of how to claim these miles on my federal returns. I've kept a log of my business miles using MileIQ as instructed by my employer to claim at the end of the year. What is the going rate for reimbursement per mile from the Fed? And would this money be going to me directly or would my parents get this money if I am claimed as a dependent?

Thanks in advance for anyone that can shed some light on my situation!",finance
personalfinance,Place Of Employment Offering Contract For Deed To Me For Property. Good Idea?,"I'll be free to add any details but want to get this Q out and avoid tl;dr. 


Edit typos


I work in property management and my boss/ company is offering to purchase a duplex with accessory carriage house as a favor/ investment for me. It's a beautiful mid 19th century Victorian home with two, 4-bedroom apartments. The carriage house already has an upstairs apartment but is to be remodeled into a 3 br house,  in which I would live,  while maintaining the rentals right next to me.  

We tried to get a secondary buyer loan and FHA with me on title but couldn't so are just having the company buy on commercial loan, with myself under contact for deed.


Money wise I would start out on a high 10% interest rate for 5 years, at which point the deed would be signed over. During this period I would pay in rent roughly 60% of what a home that size would cost me in rent in my city. A small amount more than my current shitty 2 br house.


After the 5 year period my interest rate would drop to aprox 5% and I'll begin collecting 130% of what I was paying for rent initially.  

I live in college town and rentals and property investment is pretty steady.  The value of this truly beautiful and historic house is certain to increase. It's in local historic registry and if the city has it their way, and I agree, federally it will be registered. 


This down payment is something I'd never dream of otherwise anytime soon on my own.

Once a month, I pay off my bills from my checking account and then dump any leftover in my savings account...hence why it has grown so much. The rest of my money is tied up in my 401K and Roth IRA accounts. 

My concern is that my entire retirement is tied up with stocks/index funds/bonds...all Wall Street. Is that like putting all my eggs in one basket?

I currently am on a graduated repayment plan and pay $66 a month total which will be bumped up every few years until they’re paid off. This means that only like $8 is getting paid every month to this ~$1000 loan.

Would I have comparable savings to a 15 year, where my only benefit is the flexibility in times of crisis, or does difference of interest make this a bad move? 

FOLLOW UP:

I don’t have an HSA. I max the federally allowed ($18,500 or whatever it is). I try to max my Roth IRA for me and my wife, but sometimes I don’t. I don’t put myself in a bad position by overpaying my mortgage as some have worried; I have liquidity to cover 6-12 months. Many of these insights are helpful, but I do value eliminating the mortgage payment by my late 40s which is a preference thing. 

I didn’t get the 15 year mortgage at the lower rate because at 3.5% for a 30, I value the flexibility over the nominal interest savings between plans. And this is our “forever home.”

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 25th, 2019.

# **Next week will be pivotal for markets with trade deadline, Powell, Trump-Kim and more  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/22/next-week-will-be-pivotal-for-markets-with-trade-deadline-powell-trump.html)**
*****
&gt; The coming week could be one of the most pivotal for the Trump White House and the markets, depending on how President Donald Trump chooses to proceed with China trade tariffs.
*****
&gt; U.S.-China trade talks apparently have been making progress, and in a positive sign, sources said a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is being discussed for late March. Strategists expect some eventual deal to be reached, but first and foremost, the March 2 deadline on new tariffs looms at the end of the week. For now, it looks like the deadline could be extended.
*****
&gt; Trump, in fact, Friday reiterated that he could extend the deadline if progress is being made. He also said there was a very good chance a deal could be reached with China, and that he and Xi would make the big decisions.
*****
&gt; The week is packed with major events that could be market moving, including two days of economic testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. He appears before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, and then a House committee Wednesday for the semiannual testimony.
*****
&gt; Trump also heads to Vietnam for a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday and Thursday, and U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May faces another Brexit vote in parliament.
*****
&gt; The markets are also closely watching U.S. economic data after a string of misses on manufacturing and consumer data rattled stocks in the past couple of weeks. The lack of government data during the 35-day government shutdown has made it more difficult than usual to get a handle on the economy, and some economists now see fourth-quarter and first-quarter growth running at just 2 percent or below. Fourth-quarter GDP, delayed because of the shutdown, is finally released on Thursday.
*****
&gt; #Earnings

&gt; Though earnings season is winding down, quite a few earnings releases are expected, including from retailers Home Depot, Macy'sand Nordstrom.
*****
&gt; ""To me, the biggest story next week for markets is China. Do they announce an agreement or do they at least extend the deadline? That's the one that has the most immediate market impact. The markets are pricing in good news on China next week,"" said Tom Block, Washington policy strategist at Fundstrat.
*****
&gt; There were some news reports that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Trump campaign and Russia would be provided to the attorney general next week, but a Justice Department official Friday afternoon said that was not true.Whether the Trump campaign was involved with Russia or not matters much less than whether the president himself was involved.
*****
&gt; ""This is of course great for American political drama but as for the $4.3 trillion foreign exchange market or what does this mean for the value of corporate America, it's not a big deal unless there's a smoking gun, and people think Trump is going to get impeached,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. ""Why this is important is it might paralyze other policy. … The only way it is a really big factor is if it's used as fodder to pursue further investigations that paralyze the administration like Watergate did.""
*****
&gt; Chandler said while the geopolitical events in the coming week could add to tension, they could all remain unresolved.
*****
&gt; ""We want some closure. Next week is not going to bring some closure. We're going to get extensions,"" said Chandler.
*****
&gt; The uncertainty around China trade has been impacting the economic data, and business leaders have called on the White House to end the tariffs on China. The farm belt has been hurt as China retaliated against U.S. products.
*****
&gt; Cowen analysts said the talks are nearing a ""term sheet"" between Chinese and U.S. trade negotiators. The memorandums are expected to touch on a half-dozen key areas, including forced technology transfers and cybertheft; intellectual property rights; opening up of Chinese financial services to U.S. companies; currency; agriculture, and nontariff barriers to trade. Those barriers include industrial subsidies, licensing procedures and other regulations.
*****
&gt; The talks are also expected to focus on a list of 10 goods and commodities that China will buy to help narrow the trade balance. That could include an additional $30 billion per year of U.S. farm products including soybeans, corn, and wheat, the Cowen analysts said.
*****
&gt; Fundstrat's Block said the president understands the political impact of continuing tariffs or raising them to 25 percent by March 2, as he has threatened.
*****
&gt; #Trade deadline, North Korea, Brexit

&gt; Trump has said the deadline could be extended. ""The road to 270 electoral votes for Trump goes through the farm states of the Midwest. There's no road map for Trump to get 270 electoral votes if he doesn't carry all those Midwestern farm states,"" Block said. ""China is very big for lots of reasons. …Trump's people have to figure out, at a minimum, how to extend the truce. … The biggest threat to those states is continued trade war with China focused on agricultural products exported from the U.S.""
*****
&gt; Besides China and trade and the Mueller report, Trump plans to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam in the week ahead, and Trump has said it is not to be his last meeting with Kim. The U.S. and North Korea are expected to seek a common understanding of what is expected in denuclearization, and Trump is expected to push Kim to give up his nuclear ambitions.
*****
&gt; Block said it's unclear what will come of those talks. ""Trump overstates what he does, but the world is a little safer with us talking with North Korea rather than saber rattling with North Korea. That seems to be Trump's approach. Regardless of what his thought process is, the net result is better than not doing it,"" said Block.
*****
&gt; Investors are also looking to Europe where the U.K. Parliament votes on a no-deal Brexit, which critics say would disrupt trade and commerce .
*****
&gt; Prime Minister Theresa May continues to push for Britain's exit from the European Union on March 29. On Wednesday, there will be a vote on an amendment that would give the House of Commons the power to block a no-exit deal if May has not secured the approval by Parliament for a revised Brexit deal by the middle of March.
*****
&gt; ""They're trying to force her to give up the no deal exit. The EU is expecting a request for a 60-day extension,"" said Chandler.
*****
&gt; #Economic data

&gt; As for U.S. data, reports on personal income and spending are coming on Friday and fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday. December's disappointing durable goods data showed slower business spending, so analysts are watching closely to see whether there was any improvement in consumer spending.
*****
&gt; ""The U.S. growth slowdown is seen intensifying in the first quarter too. We forecast U.S. GDP growth at a modest 1.5% annual rate in Q1. Slowing global manufacturing activity, tighter financial conditions, sluggish business equipment spending, and lackluster federal government spending (due in part to the government shutdown in January) are all contributing to the weakest quarter for U.S. growth in two years,"" wrote Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.
*****
&gt; Anderson expects fourth-quarter growth at 2.2 percent. He also said if uncertainties in the U.S. around China trade talks and the Brexit negotiations go away, there is a good chance U.S. economic growth will bounce back in the second quarter.

If for some reason either of the negotiations go seriously off-track, however, the 2019 U.S. and global economic outlook will become considerably bleaker,"" he wrote.

# Pre-Election Year March: Small-Caps Perfect 10 for 10

&gt; Turbulent March markets tend to drive prices up early in the month and batter stocks at month end. Julius Caesar failed to heed the famous warning to “beware the Ides of March” but investors have been served well when they have. Stock prices have a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously, during the latter days of the month. In March 2001, DJIA plunged 1469 points (-11.8%) from March 9 to the 22.

&gt; Normally a decent performing market month, March performs even better in pre-election years (see Vital Statistics table below). In pre-election years March ranks: 4th best for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 1000 (January, April and December are better). Pre-election year March rank #3 for Russell 2000. Pre-election year March has been up 13 out of the last 14 for DJIA. In fact, since inception in 1979, the Russell 2000 has a perfect, 10-for-10 winning record.

# When Is Overbought Bullish?

&gt; What more can we say about the amazing rebound of the stock market since December 24? For the first time since 1997, the S&amp;P 500 Index is up more than 10% for the year through this point in February. Of course, it was the worst December for stocks since the Great Depression—making a larger bounce possible—but the rebound over the past two months has been historic.

&gt; That begs the question: What does it mean when stocks are overbought on many short-term levels? “Yes, stocks are quite extended near -term,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, “but historically, extended markets have tended to deliver continued outperformance over the next several months.”

&gt; We can see this by looking at the number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are above their 50-day moving average and the subsequent performance of the index. That number recently cleared 90%, which was one of the highest readings ever. And after 90% of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 go above their 50-day moving average, their 1-, 3-, and 6-month returns actually have shown continued strength. In fact, as the LPL Chart of the Day shows, three months after hitting that 90% mark, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher 12 of the previous 13 times going back to 1990.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Overbought-Can-be-a-Good-Thing.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; This tells us the easy part of the recent rally is over, and we do see reasons to expect some type of consolidation or well-deserved pullback at some point, but we still think the stage is potentially set for new highs later this year.

# More Good News

&gt; As this week’s Weekly Market Commentary suggested, over the near term equities appear quite stretched, but overall we continue to think the bull market has plenty of life left. Today, we’ll take a look at market breadth—one of our favorite technical indicators—to explore whether it may be pointing to better times ahead for equities.

&gt; Market breadth measures how many stocks are participating in the movement of broader indexes. One of the easiest ways to measure this is via advance/decline (A/D) lines on various exchanges. An A/D line is a ratio of how many stocks go up versus down each day. The thinking is, if gains are caused by increases in many stocks, then there are plenty of buyers and the upward trend should likely continue, all else equal. On the other hand, if an upward move in a broad market gauge is driven by relatively few stocks, this can be a warning sign of cracks in the bull’s armor.

&gt; Today’s LPL Chart of the Day shows that the NYSE Common Stock Only A/D line has broken out to a new all-time high. “This is another clue to market participants that things are actually quite healthy under the surface. When advance/decline lines are breaking out to new highs, history tells us that stocks usually aren’t too far behind,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

# Broad Based Breadth

&gt; One aspect of the rally in stocks this year that we can’t stress enough is how strong breadth has been. Besides the fact that the equal-weighted S&amp;P 500 is outperforming the market cap weighted index by close to three percentage points YTD, the vast majority of S&amp;P 500 Industry Groups are also either right at or very close to YTD highs. The table below lists S&amp;P 500 Industry Groups that, along with the S&amp;P 500, hit YTD highs so far today. Of the 60 Industry Groups, 26 hit YTD highs today and five of them are already up 20% YTD!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/022219-Groups-Hitting-YTD-Highs.png))**

&gt; In addition to the 26 Industry Groups above, another 16 Industry Groups traded within 1% of a YTD high today and three of those are also up over 20% YTD. Adding both lists together, 70% of S&amp;P 500 Industry Groups either traded at or came within 1% of hitting a YTD high this morning. That’s broad!

personalfinance,"IRS says we didn't file for 2017, but we did: they refunded us... Who do we pester about this?","Tl,dr: IRS giving a Verification of Nonfiling letter for 2017 despite having filed (electronically) AND having received refunds. Thus not accepting AGI number from 2017 for 2018 filing. Anyone else in the same boat?

Who messed up here, Credit Karma or IRS? Or us, somehow?

---

Here's a timeline: 

- We filed state and fed taxes in 2017 using Credit Karma Tax in 1st week of April, 100% electronically.

- Married filing jointly using **husband**'s CK account.

- Returns were ACCEPTED. We have the resulting PDF called ""FORM_ACCEPTED_FEDERAL_2017.pdf"".

- Abt. Two weeks later we get our Federal refund direct-deposited as requested.

- A few months later we get a check in the mail with our State refund, with a paper saying ""We sent it by mail to avoid fraud"" (essentially).

- A few months after *that*, we get a letter from the IRS stating ""You have **passed** an audit."" WTF? We didn't think anything of it since it said we had passed.

- Now 2018. We tried filing: need our AGI number. Enter it from the PDF document above, returns are **rejected**.

- Go to IRS [Get Transcript](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript) website, discover a Verification of Nonfiling letter for 2017. Wtf?

- Call the IRS, they say ""The returns are under your wife's account."" WTF x2, we filed using the husband's account / SSN, he is the breadwinner, he is the primary, not the wife.

- Go back to IRS Get Transcript website, make an account for wife, unfortunately can't login immediately. Must wait a week or so to check.

- Go to ""[Refund Status](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/irfof/lang/en/irfofgetstatus.jsp)"" website instead: no refund status is visible for either husband **or** wife...

---

Can someone please give us an idea of what may be going on here. Did the audit (that we passed) somehow mangle our 2017 return? 

How do we prove that we filed to the IRS for 2017? Everything was done electronically.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

From what I can tell my 401k is not all that great fees wise, however if I contribute 4% the company matches 2%, and has an additional 3% contribution whether I contribute or not, this means if I contribute 4%, then I end up having 9% going to my 401k (4% me, 2% match, 3% independent). I previously came from a Hancock retirement, which seemed a lot simpler. I am currently 32 years old, have no debt other than a mortgage on my house which is about 1500/mo for interest/deductible/escrow with a gross income of 65,000 and an annual  performance bonus of 10%.

My SO is looking for a PC game that she could play but we don't encouter anything that attire her attention.

# She likes :

* **The Sims**, she has played it for years and still do from time to time. however, she can spend hours creating a family and a house but get really bored after a few minutes of gameplay.
* **League of legends**, we used to play together a lot and still play with friends but I'm less and less attracted by the game, so does she.
* **Ark**, she just tried it on my steam account, loved it but never get motivation for start a game by herself. I think the game needs too much implication for her.
* **Zoo Tycoon, Roller Coaster Tycoon &amp; other varients**. Same as the sims, she loves to build, hates to play.
* **Dofus** (a MMORPG), but only loved profession and spending all day gathering wood &amp; stuff. She would never fight or level up.

# She hates : 

* **FPS game**, we played a bit overwatch but didn't went so well
* **Ori and the blind forest**,wow, never been so wrong. I thought she would love it so I bought it. Worst $ ever spent.
* **Any Mario related game**, my Mario addiction fed her up.

personalfinance,What is the best way to target student loans &amp; utilizing loan deferment to benefit loan payoff,"I have been paying my student loans for the past two years based on a 10 year payoff plan, but have recently decided to sit down and calculate out if there is a better way to target my loans while still paying the same amount per month. Right now I pay $300 every month, this payment goes to 10 different loans. As I said above, the payment is based on paying off the loan in 10 years. The best way I could think of is to identify what loans (1 to 3 loans maybe) I am paying the most in interest every month and target these. Additionally I would identify the loans (1 to 3 maybe) that I am paying the least amount in interest every month, I would only pay the interest on these loans each month so the principal doesn't increase and then I would use the money that I would typically use as the loan payment for these loans on the higher interest loans. This would help knock down the princical on the higher intrest payment loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Since this method requires me to use the actual interest being paid each month, and not the interest rate, I would need to re-evaluate the target loans periodically because the amount paid in interest will be decreasing. I would then change the target loans to the new highest interest payment loans.

&amp;#x200B;

If I decide to target loans like this, will there be any adverse affect for technically not making a loan payment on the lower interest loans? Any affect on my credit score? I will still be paying the interest, only the pricical will remain the same.

&amp;#x200B;

To throw another curve into the mix, I recently started graduate school, which my company will be paying for. I am taking one class per semester, and will be part time. This will likely take me 3 to 4 years to complete my studies. Since I am going back to school, I have the option to request my loans be placed in deferment. Three of my loans are subsidized loans, which, if placed in deferment will not accrue interest or be capitalized after the deferment period. The remaining 7 loans will have the interest capitilazed once the deferment period is over. I plan to continue to pay my student loan payment every month even if the loans are approved for deferment. However, for the three loans that interest will not be accruing, I assume it would be best to take the amount that I would be spending on interest and apply it to the loans I previoiusly identified to target?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I over looking anthing? Does this method make sense? Is there a better way to target loans? This is my first post, so I am sorry if I did not provide all information.",finance

personalfinance,[US-CO] Bankruptcy or keep chipping away?,"Good morning everyone,

A couple of years ago I had a medical issue that put me out of work for over a year and our finances slipped considerably. After recovery, treatment and a career change we've gotten back on track and can make all our payments. I've been wondering if the damage done is worth filing bankruptcy over or if we just keep chipping away at it by ourselves. No medical bills included as insurance covered everything.

I suppose I'm not really looking at advice to handle the debts/payments, as we've already worked out how we're paying things off and when. What I'm looking for, I guess, is whether we continue paying these off and re-establishing credit ourselves, or are we too far gone and should just file bankruptcy? I would like to purchase a home sometime in the future once we've recovered, as we've decided to settle down where we're at. 

If bankruptcy is the answer, then should we do Chapter 7 or Chapter 13? With our income we're above the median so would need to do the means test for Chapter 7, and I'm not too keen on just walking away from everything considering we *can* pay it off. Chapter 13 seems the more responsible choice but then what is the difference between that and just paying it off ourselves?

Looking at Chapter 13, I assume we would do a 36-month plan based on our Debt-to-Income ratio, at least as I've calculated it. Not including our student loans, our 36 month payment would be roughly $2,135 based off some random calculator I used that uses 4.5% federal interest on a 100% repayment. I guess I'm just not sure if there's a benefit to filing.

The trouble I've come across is when using the 'Repayment Estimator' provided on the student loans government website.

My current federal loan balance is $38,695. Under the standard repayment option it says I will pay a total of $28,674 over 10 years in total. What happened to the other 10k + interest that will accrue? Do I not have to actually pay back the entire balance?

Under the REPAYE payment plan I'd pay $24,981 over 40 months. Every option I see suggests that I will pay back less than what my current loan balance is and I'm a bit confused.

I am trying to go in via a term based repayment plan, there are 4 offered, 

&amp;#x200B;

Standard   676.88 a month, which by my calculations, with no interest calculated in sees me paying it all in 7.2 years.

Graduated   423.60 a month, with payments increasing every two years

Ext. Standard  334.11 a month, term is up to 25 years.

Ext Graduated  218.13 a month, with payments increasing every two years, also has a term of up to 25 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to attempt to do the snowball that I keep seeing everyone talking about, with the standard payment plan, I do not know if I will be able to afford 676 a month, and then add more on top of that. But I am not sure. I am currently waiting to get my rent payment lowered, and my girlfriend will be moving to my town with me. We currently have an apartment in CT that we both pay 575 a month for. (1 BR) However, down here in the town I just moved back to, rent totals are usually around $600 total. Which would definitely save us some money.

personalfinance,Financial aid refund questions,"I am taking college courses right now, on both federal financial aid and Navy tuition assistance (I am active duty Navy).  The amount of financial aid I receive entitles me to a refund, however both this and last semester the refund has been short by about $1500, which is exactly the cost of my Navy tuition assistance.  

The ledger clearly shows the school having been paid by the Navy as well as by my PELL grant both this and last semester so it looks like the school is giving me my PELL grant refund and then keeping the Navy TA on top of the payment from my grant.  I'm sure this seems petty because it's only $3,000 over the last year, but I work really hard to keep my grades up to maintain eligibility while working 12-14 hour days five days a week in the military so I would like to keep the money to which I am entitled.  Also this seems less petty when considering that 3k is about 15% of my annual take-home pay.

personalfinance,Need some non-judgmental advice on my current situation. Should I sell an almost-paid off vehicle to pay off a pile of credit card debt?,"My wife and I are in our early thirties and we have three kids.

We have made some less-than-optimal decisions over the years with our budget that have left us with a pile of short-term debt that we feel unable to payoff and no savings. Quick picture of our financial health:

- We net about $5400 per month, combined. We live an in area with low cost of living, thankfully.
- 7 years into a 30 year mortgage, paying $850 a month. 
- Two cars. One 2012 large SUV on a five year note, $330/month, one year down on the note. The other is a 2008 Honda with two payments left of $276/month(paid off in April).
- Around $8500 in credit card debt on two separate cards, about equal in balance. Interest rates are around 20%.
- Various other normal monthly bills and commitments of varying amounts.
- Savings ran out this month.
- I have about $10,000 in a government employee retirement account from a previous job I haven't rolled to a normal IRA yet.

We don't consciously try to add to the credit card balance but over the years we've been lax about saving and debt. So emergency expenses and purchases - unexpected medical bills, large car repairs we weren't expecting, big house repairs, etc. It sucks. And without a plan to pay we've just let the CC balances languish with minimum payments, never getting smaller.

A few months ago we started to cut back on some things - eating out less, cutting out cable, putting hobbies on hiatus - and while we made some headway, it wasn't enough, and we find ourselves pretty much unable to pay the balances off as they stand. We don't make that much money and it's unlikely we'll see raises anytime soon (we work in non-profit and small family business jobs). And we won't ask for help from either of our parents who have already done a lot for us and who have their own financial goals.

This month we realized we'd had enough. We have zero savings, we're living check to check and need to make a drastic change. We're willing to do whatever it takes to be healthy even on our small salaries. So we put up our cheaper 2008 vehicle for sale. I believe I can get around $7,000 for it, though I might have to take a lower number since I don't even have the money to fix some of the cosmetic issues. We can't sell the large SUV because it's the only car that can fit our entire family.

Our plan is this: to sell the car, use it to pay off the lion's share of the credit card debt, and consolidate the rest with a 9.95% loan from a local credit union (the best interest rate we could find for this type of loan). We'll live as a one car family until we build up our savings and pay off the last of our short term debt. We're cutting down our food budget even more and eliminating other commitments. I'll ride my bike to work which I fortunately am able to do.

**My question for this sub is**: is it a bad idea to sell a car that is almost paid off to knock out 75% of our short term debt?

I have a lot of people telling me I'm crazy for doing it because we're so close, and it's messing with my head a little.

Paying off will net us $276 per month, but there will still be insurance and repair costs. Another line item to save for. And that $8500 will take a lot longer to tackle - 9.95% is still a lot. It will take longer for us to reach our goals - just to have an extra car. Which admittedly would be handy, but isn't necessary for us to live. And the value will continue to decline as the miles go over 100,000 (it's currently at 99 and in good condition) and the car gets older.

I appreciate any feedback and insight. Sorry for the wall of text. I've been trying to run the numbers as best I can to figure out where we're headed and this seems like the best option. Let me know what you think.",finance
personalfinance,Quarterly payments for next year,"Prior to marrying my significant other they always had to pay quarterly taxes.

This year turbotax says that my significant other does not need to pay quarterly taxes for their business because it is not expected that we will owe money at the end of the next year after it took all our numbers into account.

Does this just mean my W-2 income is over-witholding tax, enough such that it covers whatever quarterly taxes they were paying in prior years (before marriage, etc)? If that is the case I am fine with it! Money all goes to the same place anyway, but does that work that way and do they really not have to pay quarterly taxes anymore? They do still have to pay state quarterly taxes of a couple hundred dollars...

3. I am looking into buying an Acura, since it’s a car that can hold its price for several years.

personalfinance,I'm having trouble deciding which of these different scenarios is the most optimal way to pay off my student loans and I could use some help,"As the title says, I've been giving some thought to the subject of how best to pay off my student loans.  Right now, I am on income based repayment, which means that I will only pay them off if my income increases drastically or after 25 years because they are graduate loans.  I initially started with a balance of $109,000, but my parents were kind enough to give me a gift of $50,000, so I now have $59,000, split between two separate federal loans.

My loan balance is:

* $20,877 at 6.2%
* $38,395 at 5.4% interest

 I recently bought a car - a 2019 Honda Fit EX Manual - that I pay $264 a month on (I know, not the best choice, but I was mad at my old car).  I would like to transition my spending to the following budget in the next month, which I believe I can do

&amp;#x200B;

|Category|Amount|

|Rent|950|
|Utilities|100|
|Restaurants and eating out|150|
|Groceries|175|
|Eating out at work |40|

I make $4,186 a month if I do not contribute to my company's ESPP plan and I plan to stop contributing to it as soon as I adopt this budget.  I also save 14% into my company's 401k plan, but I'm not sure what the tax implications are or how my income changes if I roll it down to 6%, which is what my company matches up to.  With the remaining money, I would have an extra $1,298 extra to put towards my loans.  I have a couple of options and I could use some help deciding which is the most optimal.

1. **Sell ESPP Stock Shares and use some savings and tax return money to pay off one, then start burning down the other.**

I have $12,000 worth of stock in my company that I bought on an average of $8,000 cost basis.  2/3's of it is still short term.  I would sell this and add my tax return and some savings to the $20,877 loan.  I would then move to limit the amount of money I save and spend every month and direct it all to my loans.  I would pay the $20,000 loan off in the next month or two, then burn down the other loan within a year and a half.

2. ​ **Sell the car, buy a cheap one to get rid of the payment, then burn down my loans**.

If I do this, I would sell my car and net around $2,500.  I would use this, plus some of my bonus money and tax refund to buy a cheaper car, then burn down my loan starting with the $20,000 and then moving to the other.  In this way, I will take a hit on the depreciation, but can use the money I spend on my car on this instead.

3. **Keep the car, keep the stocks, but burn down the loans.**

I will keep both, but use the tax refund some of my bonus on the loan balance and then pay down my loans following this budget.  

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly do not know which is the most optimal choice.  I've asked friends and they don't seem to have any good ideas, so I thought I'd reach out and ask the hivemind what they think the most optimal play is.  I'm looking to pay down my loans in 2.5 - 3 years.  Thank you for all of your help!

The problem with this is that everyone with access to the sign in page sees all of the other accounts that they have nothing to do with. It also means users have to browse to S3 and view the file from their jump account login. From a usability perspective I don't like this.

Is there any definitive reason for managing federation providers in a single account and using cross account versus federating to every account as needed?

Has anyone seen or used any solution that provides users with a sign-in selection that is customized to their own IAM access rights?

My in-laws were nice enough to lend me the whole amount to pay it off and pay them back at 3% interest. We took the deal. We started paying them $1000 monthly and recently stepped up to $1500 monthly because we could afford to do it. I'm not so sure that's the best strategy for us since this is such a low interest loan. 

Before I ramble on any further, here is our financial situation:

**Pre-tax Annual Income:** $123k (Me 56k, Wife 67k)

**Monthly budget:** 

$7,520 combined take home per month (we both get paid biweekly)

$1,980 rent/utilities/phone bill/cat food/insurance/etc

$1,500 loan repayment

$2,300 moved into savings/Roth IRA (If there are 3 pay periods in a month, the entire third payment goes into savings)

Which leaves **$1740** to split between the two of us for groceries/gas/eating out/vacations/etc. We don't really have many other expenses. We were able to go on two vacations with the mo

**Emergency Fund:** $18k (6 months expenses; was $15k but we recently went up)

**Savings:** **$28.5K** in joint savings account intended for eventual down payment on house

Wife also has **$43k** in a separate savings account from before we got married that's just sitting there collecting dust. We don't quite know what to do with this money. We were thinking about maybe putting into a 529 (she eventually wants to get an MBA). We are ok with also using this towards a down payment or towards any other reasonable expense.

Wife puts in 5% into 401k (100% match up to 5% at her job). Currently has like $20k in it. My employed does not match so I am only putting in 3% into my 403b. We both max out our Roth IRAs.

**Debt:** We own both of our cars. We pay off our credit card statement balance at the end of every month. Both of us have good credit. Our only debt is the $149k that we owe her parents.

**Financial/Life Goals:**

1. Buy a house in ~3 years (12/2021 is when I'll find out where I'll go for fellowship training and I'll be there for a while). We save $20k annually towards goal down payment/closing costs/misc house-related fees of $80k. Hoping to buy in the 250k range.
2. Start trying to have kids in ~2.5 years. We are also on pace to have $~12-15k saved up to help with baby-related costs around that time.
3. Buy a car in ~3.5 years. My car is like 12 years old so we're probably going to replace it with a newer car around that time.
4. We would like to achieve financial independence by age ~52-54. It would be nice to have the option to retire early from full-time work and work for international nonprofits / teaching hospitals with a service mindset towards the end of my career.

**So, here are the questions:**

1. Given our above financial goals and knowing that I'll earn significantly more in about 7-8 years ($~400k starting), what should be our optimum strategy regarding paying back this personal loan? We have to pay a minimum of $1000 per month, but anything beyond that is up to us to decide. Since it has such a low rate of interest, I am tempted to pay the minimum and free up extra money to use elsewhere. 
2. Is there any way I could deduct the interest I pay to my in-laws from my taxes? I know that you can deduct up to $2500 in interest pain on student loans. Can this loan from them count as a consolidated student loan for tax purposes?
3. What should we do with the $43k that's just sitting there? Is there a way I can put all of that into a 529 account? Would that even be a smart thing to do? She wants to do an MBA probably about 5-6 years from now at the earliest. Would it be smart to maybe put it into a 3 year bond or to invest it? please advise.
4. My wife and I decided to not max out our 401k/403b because (1) we're prioritizing maxing out the roth IRA and (2) we figured we can save more aggressively once I start earning my attending salary. Is this a mistake? If we save too aggressively for retirement then I am afraid we may be shooting ourselves in the foot by not having enough of a down payment for a house.
5. On the same note, should I continue contributing 3% towards my 403b? There is no employer match.

personalfinance,I am beginning to really question my choice of buying a house. What are my best options?,"Very long story short, I bought my house fresh out of college. I purchased it for around $104,000 or so. It's a small house with about 1200 sq ft. I bought a house because everyone insisted that renting was throwing my money away.

However, when I really started crunching the numbers, I am starting to wonder if this is really the case. Due to the obscene mortgage insurance and interest rate, I have only paid 12k down on the principle since February of 2014. The house has only appreciated to $119,000 according to a letter I got from the county.

In that time, I have spent $4.8k on a new HVAC system, $2200 on flooring, $2k on new appliances and not insignificant amount on paint. It was a fixer-upper. 

I am seriously considering selling and moving into an apartment. The upkeep, lawn care, etc. doesn't seem worth it for the paltry amount that I can sell it for. I live alone and have no pets. What's the point of having a house in my situation? It's just a money sink. I would be perfectly happy with a bedroom and a tiny living room - half the rooms I have are a waste. Apartments in my area like that are &lt;$700 a month in a very nice area. My house is in the middle of nowhere and I am sick of driving 30-45 minutes to get anywhere. 

Any advice?",finance

personalfinance,"Keep renting or buy in Paris, France","I'm an expat living in Paris with a local wife, and I've recently discovered that you can get a 1.75% interest rate mortgage fixed at that rate for the 25 year term of the mortgage here. I'm hoping that someone can help me work out if we're better buying or renting in this kind of situation.

Our combined income is ~€6000 a month after taxes (although we expect her salary to go up when she moves from the public to private sector in a few years). We're currently renting a very small 1BR apartment for 1100€ a month and saving/investing 2000€ a month, but are now considering buying a modern bigger 2BR in our neighbourhood (outskirts of Paris in the 13eme arr., but lots of construction and lots of big businesses setting up around here) for around 600k-700k. I have 250k€ in ETFs and bonds, so would be pulling about 150k€ from the market to act as a deposit. This would cost us about €2.5k a month in mortgage repayments (plus 200-300€ in bills/HOA fees), meaning we'd only be saving/investing a few hundred a month on our current salaries. It is also worth noting that closing fees can be 10-20% of the purchase price here!

We could look at buying something cheaper, but our logic is that buying bigger means we could stay there long term and have kids etc without moving.

Our long term plan is to retire down to the much cheaper south of France, so the other option is to buy a cheaper house down there, try to rent it out (slower market so not guaranteed to find a tenant) and let that tick over until we reach a FIRE situation where we can leave Paris.

What would you do in our position? Keep renting or buy? Buy in Paris or buy in the south?

personalfinance,Invest in master's degree or other goals for educator with step salary raises,"I'm trying to determine when is the best time to get a masters degree. I am fortunate that my job as an educator comes with a salary schedule that operates on a fairly simple step system that combines time in the job with your education level. I'm going to paste the rough schedule at the bottom of the post. At the highest step, there are only relatively smaller COL increases. 

I estimate that it will cost me about $6500 to pay for the master's degree, in addition to about $1800 in lost wages for a side job that I won't be able to do. I should be able to take it out as an Direct Unsubsidized Loan (Graduate) with an interest rate of 6.6%. I have looked around but haven't seen a better deal on the degree that meets my needs. My district won't subsidize it.

Otherwise my financial situation is thankfully pretty stable. My partner and I have a combined income of around $110K, have a 5-mo emergency fund, and no high interest debt. We have about $40,000 in student loan debt between 4-6.5%. We are saving for retirement at about 15%/year of our combined salaries.

Because there are other things we'd like to save for, like a down payment on a house in rising COL city, and because we are really only doing the best practice minimum when it comes to retirement, and will also need a new vehicle in the next 5 years, I am trying to determine when makes the most financial sense to get the degree. You'll see from the schedule that my pay increases more for having the MS in the later years of the salary schedule. Should we be investing elsewhere, or should I get the MS as soon as possible to realize the most gains from my step increases?

personalfinance,"Tax Questions RE: Renting a room to a family member as well as collecting ""rent"" from my fiance.","Hello tax people of PF! I purchased my first home at the beginning of January. I live here with my fiance and her brother (who rents the 2nd master from me). As I just finished my 2018 taxes, I was wondering how this would arrangement will impact my 2019 taxes.

For reference, my mortgage + tax is $3600 and there is a $120 mo HOA. My fiance and her brother both pay me $850 a month. Annualized my mortgage + HOA is approximately $44,500 and I will ""collect"" $20,400 from the two of them. So I am not renting this for a profit.

I've seen a lot of conflicting information online about whether it's taxable in full or in part. I bought the house fully expecting the fiance to contribute and we share a bedroom, so I imagine that constitutes cost sharing which doesn't need to be reported (or the IRS doesn't care about?). Next year we'll be married so this is the only year I'm concerned about her portion of it. On the flip side, her brother has his own room. The home is 2,500 square feet and his private room, walk-in and bathroom measures 30x13, or 16% of the house square footage. Does that mean I can offset 16% of the total mortgage + tax against the income? Would this include home improvement purchases such as a new thermostat, washer/dryer, refrigerator or Ring doorbell? What about common areas?

Also, does this create a tax situation for him as we're arguably renting the room to him below market rate (rent for something similar is $1,200+ here, but you might be able to find one without a closet or a bath for $850)?

I also don't know how likely it is the IRS will audit me, but I make $170,000 a year (not counting the rent). My tax burden after deductions will be 33.3 between state and federal. I'm just trying to avoid a surprise $6,750 tax bill next year. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Should we buy our first home based on our current financial state?,"This would be our home purchasing scenario: 30 year loan, 3% down, $200K. We like our city and don’t see ourselves moving any time soon. It is an up and coming city, and home prices are, at least by some, projected to keep rising. Now here are our specs:

\- My wife and I are both 31.

\- She has a $45K paying job and is in search of a higher paying job.

\- She has had strange symptoms for the past year, still undiagnosed. Her arms hurt when she types a good bit, but it is not carpal tunnel or tendinitis. Based on other prior symptoms, seems to be nerve related. It makes her job a little uncomfortable at times.

\- I am a freelance wedding photographer with a $30K salary.

\- We have no debt currently.

\- We hope to have a baby within the next few years, before it’s a little to late for her.

\- I am currently taking prerequisites to apply for a masters program this fall.

\- If all goes well, I should be working with my new degree in summer 2022.

\- I am looking to become an occupational therapist. Demand is growing and pays well.

\- Tuition and books would be about $45K.

\- I am already making less than $30K/year (maybe 20) since I am taking a few classes to meet requirements for grad program.

\- While in grad school I will probably only be making around $10-15K as a photographer if all goes well since it is a 7 semester, super demanding program.

\- Based on job shadowing I have done, I should make at least 60K coming out of school if not a good bit more.

\- We are both very responsible with money, so I would hope to pay all of my student debt within a few years after graduating, and then move on to paying the house in another few years.

\- My car is a 2005 and may very well need to be replaced within a few years.

I realize we’re not in the best place financially, but we also realize our alternative doesn’t necessarily help our situation. I cannot raise a family with my photographer salary, and waiting to do something about it will just put us further behind. And our housing alternative is to continue to rent as opposed to pay towards something we will own, the sooner we start. Also, home prices may keep increasing, rent going up as usual, and possibly interest rates too; so saving for a greater down payment and more income could be like swimming against a current. Some argue one should not buy simply because renting is just as pricey or pricier than mortgage, taxes, and insurance,,, because you end up paying more after repairs. But what I think is, sure, you pay repairs, but your home appreciates (typically) and the money you pay each month goes towards something that will be yours (despite it being mostly interest at first) and not to pay off someone else’s mortgage. Also, rent goes up while only a fraction of your mortgage goes up (the taxes, insurance, and inflation for repair materials part). Not to mention, the money you owe becomes less significant over time, due to inflation. Lastly, the longer we wait to have a kid, the greater the risk for my wife who is already 31. These are my arguments, but I am no financial planning expert and may need some advice/correcting. Thank you in advance.

personalfinance,Debt relief program,"Hello, 

A little backstory, I bought a very affordable foreclosure from the government last summer. As such I cannot sell for 2 years.  I had to put some of my remodeling savings to actually get the house, which was ok but it dropped my savings.  I ended up putting $8,000 down on a $60,000 house. I spent time and money remodeling and did all the work myself and with my dad. I still need to finish a bathroom and paint some walls. However I ran out of money and put a fair amount on credit cards. All was fine until I had to buy a new furnace and did not qualify for financing due to previous card usage. I ended up putting that on card and now I'm overwhelmed. I have about $25,000 in credit cards. I have applied for a home equity loan, and got approved with the amount I needed but they wanted a cosigner for 25 years and they wanted me to refinance at a higher rate. So now my credit is pretty low, I make about 50,000k a year and I pay all the minimums and was working the snowball method until the furnace crippled me. I'm considering a debt management plan and that the interest is dropped and most of my payments would go to the principal. Before anyone asks, I literally budget every week as I get paid weekly.

If I wait and do the conversion the following year while living in a state with no income tax, is this avoided?
3. I can access money put into a Roth IRA at any time with no penalty (the contributions, not the investment gains). How does this work in terms of Roth IRA conversions?

The last 2 are contingent if I stay with my parents after graduation (Which both me and my parents are willing to do)

* &lt; $100 USD in credit card debt (which is still in 0% APR until August)
* Regular therapy/psychiatrist appointments (Note I'm 21 and still covered under their insurance).


I say maybe access because I did have a car that my sister and I bought for us that we were letting my parents use until they had money for a down payment on a new car. The car we bought was old but within our price range. The car died and according to a trusted mechanic it's totaled. In May my parents will have enough money to put a down payment on another car and they'll be willing to let me use it.

Note: for about $6000 of those federal student loans I have already used my grace period because I took a semester off after being hospitalized twice within a month. So they will be due in May.

The best solution obviously would be to stay with my parents, pride be damned. The rent would be relatively cheap and I have access to a car.

personalfinance,"$100,000+ in debt. Am I going in the right direction?","I am in need of some advice. I am 29 years old and I currently live in Southern California am $100,000+ worth in debt. This is from two bachelors (first philosophy, second in Nursing) and a master’s degree in nursing that is in progress and lastly credit card debt. I was working as an assistant for about 4 years, making about $40,000 a year prior to becoming a Registered Nurse. I was at a dead-end job and I knew how much nurses were making in CA so I went for it plus I enjoy helping others. 

&amp;#x200B;

My finaces: [https://i.imgur.com/QgXef3W.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QgXef3W.jpg) (breakdown)

Hourly: $42, starting in June $50 (this is a for sure thing since I automatically move up in the ladder).  However, raises will stall at that rate for a while. 

Hours worked a week: 40

Monthly Income (AFTER taxes): roughly $4,300 (after my increase I’m thinking I’ll have an extra $1,000). Since I am also doing my masters full-time I am unable to work more another job. 

I decided to go back to grad school and get masters in nursing because my employer has a tuition reimbursement program that pays for about 50% of the tuition. I am able to put my loans in deferment ($32,000 of my loans are subsidized so gov pays for interest while in school). $7,000 of my student loans is Perkins Loans and I am able to get them forgiven after 5 years working as a nurse. With my tuition reimbursement and loan cancellation of my Perkins my masters will end up costing my about $5000. In nursing, having an advance degree is very helpful especially in management positions so I took the plunge early. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plan: 

Whatever increase I get in June I plan on putting all of that towards my debt. My current goal is to pay off my private loan, followed by my private student loan, then my federal student loans. 

My current credit score is 755. So I’ve been offered by 3 of my credit cards balance transfers at 4% fee and 0% interest for 1 year. I am thinking of transferring my personal loan ($18,500) towards this since the interest rate for that loan is 14.7%. If I pay roughly $1500-2000 on that loan a month I can pay it off before the promo ends. The only thing is I did a consolidation so I could just have 1 payment, yet this seems to be the more logical thing to do. Personally, I would like to pay all of this debt off by the time I am 35. However, it seems I would not have much saved if I did. I do not want a roommate. I had a roommate and she stole from me and I do not need to deal with that again.

Do you all think my plan is attainable? If I could go back, I would have just gone straight to nursing, but that ship has sailed. I was also pretty reckless with my money and I am trying to change all that before I hit 30 this year.",finance
personalfinance,"I think I made an error on my Federal return, help!","So I was doing my taxes for the first time by myself this year and had triple checked everything so I filed my Federal taxes.  I thought all was well until I did my state file and my state return was nearly twice as large as my federal.  I filed with a free file from the IRS website (did not use Turbo Tax - I used Free1040TaxReturn.com or something like that) for the federal.

That didn't seem typical especially given my returns the past few years, but from what I have read, it could happen (I may have taken additional exemptions for my W-2 only on federal).  Anyway, the federal had already been filed but I decided to hold off on filing my state taxes in case I needed to correct my federal return.  Well, the federal return was accepted, but I'm still not sure it was completed correctly.  What is my best option here?

* Should I take them to a tax person and try to get everything straightened away, possibly pay a decent amount to have them tell me it's okay?
* Should I go ahead and file my state with the information I used on the federal?
* Should I go back through my 1040 and try to figure out if my return would change significantly if I can find where I think I went wrong and change that, then submit a 1040X?

Not really sure what the best option would be here.  My federal return was about $700 and my state return looks to be $1500.  Is it worth it to try to figure out if I owe more or should be getting back more, or is it okay to go with it since they accepted the return?

personalfinance,"My Money Disappeared! (Okay, kind of)","When I entered high school, my grandmother gave me a bank book for an account she opened for me when I was little. My father took it from me to make sure I didn’t spend it and squirreled it away. When I decided to make a move to a much larger city a couple of years ago, I asked for it back so I could make up for the money I was spending on my move. 

So...this account was in my grandmother’s name, POD to me. She passed away a few years ago. When I brought it to the bank they told me it was an inactive account and therefore was turned over to the state and I should contact them, as it was considered unclaimed property. 

The state has no record of the account being turned over. Not under my name and SSN, my grandmother’s name and SSN, we even checked my father and his siblings (the employee I worked with was SO HELPFUL and looked into every possible thing). 

To complicate matters, the bank was originally another bank that became another bank that Webster Bank took over. 

I was told the following by the bank: keep the bank book, it is proof that the account existed and that I am owed money.

I was told the following by the state: It’s possible that the bank never turned it over properly and in that case, is liable for whatever amount the account would be now considering the time that has passed and the interest rate. 

I’m looking into Graduate school and while this wouldn’t be a lot of money (under $10,000) it could really help. Also, my sweet Irish immigrant grandma saved that money for me and would be livid to hear I wasn’t pursuing it.

personalfinance,Applying for credit cards AND private student loans... bad idea?,"Hello all, 

I was hoping that I (mid 20s F) could gain a little insight on here regarding credit cards, credit score, and private student  loans. About two years ago I opened my first credit card. Since I had absolutely no credit history to speak of at the time, I had to go for Capital One's Platinum card (high APR, no perks). Since I kept utilization low and always paid on time, I now have good credit in the 750s and was considering upgrading my card to something that offered miles or cash back. I understand that doing so will require a hard pull, which should ding my credit score for a while (?). 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I recently returned to school full time, and it seems that private loans are unavoidable in the near future (probably this fall or summer depending on my federal award). Will the hard credit check from upgrading my card impact my ability to obtain a decent private loan? Should I wait to upgrade after securing loans, or will that make it harder to get a better card? I'd also appreciate any other bits of student loan wisdom thrown my way since I'm basically figuring this out all on my own. Thanks!",finance

I owe roughly $30,000 on it still and I have $35,000 in my savings account I’ve been using to save as a down payment on a house. My question is would it be more beneficial to pay off my truck in full and save the $665 extra a month, or use the money I’ve been saving as a down payment and keep the monthly payments? Another tidbit is my savings account has a 2.5% interest rate so long as I keep a balance of $25,000 in the account so that would go away were I to pay off the truck.

gaming,FYA Game publishers / devs.,"Dear Double Damage publisher and developer,

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like use this opportunity to highlight my opinion:

&amp;#x200B;

Companies on my personal black list (avoid / do not support / do not buy):

Electronic Arts for many years now, for complete downhill ride after NFS Porsche,

Ubisoft added within last few years for Splinter Cell downhill and other releases,

Activision Blizzard added after last BlizzCon for Destroying WoW and D Immortal (WTF),

Bethesda this one is obvious (Fallout 76),

Deep Silver and 4A Games for Metro Exodus launch (Epic Exlusive),

Konami for recent Metal Gear Survival macro transactions,

Double Damage just added today after purchasing your Rebel Galaxy game.

&amp;#x200B;

This list is just an example, and if you really pay attention, it shows how many developers and / or publishers are going downhill with their decisions. I'm talking here about MACRO transactions, buggy releases, loot boxes, badly handled PR, (pre-order, alpha, beta, demo) bullsh!t, last but not the least store exclusivity.

&amp;#x200B;

As my above list also indicates, shady schemes, practices and decision frequency is increasing especially rapidly within last two years when publishers are becoming increasingly GREEDY!

&amp;#x200B;

There is no excuse for you (Double Damage) to become a part of Epic (COMPLETE GARBAGE) Store exclusivity deal, do you know why?

Simply because if you would have post a note on the steam game page saying:

""Dear customers, unfortunately due to higher prices on Steam we have to increase price of our product to make it available on Steam for you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I would cheer this, bless this and pay that (HIGHER) price without saying a word because I genuinely was interested in that purchase (Rebel Galaxy Outlaw) until I realized you have sign that F...ret@rded exclusivity deal with them Epic tw@ts.

&amp;#x200B;

In my personal opinion, there is absolutely no excuse for that, therefore from now on, You are on my black list as well. For this stupid idiotic selfish and greedy approach and lack of communication between YOU (Double Damage) and Steam Community - me / us. Did you ask me / us if I would be ok with it? Did you asked if you could compensate higher fees with higher price for your product? No, so go to hell. Simple as that.

&amp;#x200B;

Some, may now understand why I have still added Deep Silver alongside 4A Games.

&amp;#x200B;

Why have I purchased Rebel Galaxy then? To show my support for no MACRO transactions and other shady bs floating nowadays like it was something customers are supposed to apologize for - that isn't in your games for now...

&amp;#x200B;

Consider this: as more and more players are getting fed up - and to clarify - we are not fed up with you side deals with Epic tw@ts, but rather with your lazy excuses why it cannot be available on Steam, the more you will loose altogether in longer period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you won't get many sales in there - just so that you would remember, for who, are your products really for!

This has correlated with a fall in bond interest rates and an increase in the cost to buy stocks unit of earnings. During this time inflation has fallen from its highs in the 1980s to low levels even though the supply of money is increasing faster than inflation. This makes sense because the wealthy buy more stocks and bonds as they get wealthier and the rest of us can not afford higher prices and businesses are not feeling pressure to raise prices as employee expenses are increasing more slowly than the businesses are growing their access to capital.

personalfinance,"If we're preparing for a recession, is it a better idea to pay student loans aggressively, or build up more liquid capital?","Hey everyone! Been mulling this over quietly for a while now and figured it would be good to get some opinions. 

**TL;DR - If a recession is coming, is it better to aggressively get out of student debt and potentially hit the recession with less liquid capital, or is it better to have a more moderate debt repayment strategy to bolster your “pre recession” safety net?**

I have recently gotten a massive increase in stable income, and on top of that am now in a dual income no kids situation. All told, as a household we should be able to save between $70,000-$80,000 a year after taxes and living expenses (including standard student loan payments). 

This is obviously great, however I also have about $65,000 in student debt (2 Federal loans, one at 5%, one at 6%). My first instinct was to begin aggressively paying down this debt (we already have a 3-6 month safety net) and pay it down all this year. 

However, I have recently been seeing a lot of talk about a looming, severe, recession in the US. In my research on ways to prep for a recession, one very common theme is to attempt to minimize debts in case your income falls through. 

I am currently in a position to put around $20,000 towards the loan to jump start this process. My fear, however, is that I would aggressively pay this loan, be debt free by the end of the year, and then have the economy tank and recession hit shortly thereafter or before - leaving us with less liquid capital on hand to use in case of layoffs etc... Even if it extends the life and lifetime cost of the loan, does it make sense to hold back on aggressive payments for an increased recession runway?",finance

He has the money in a CD there with a 14% interest rate. I was shocked at the interest rate. He says there isn't any catch or extra fee involved. I thought maybe that the rate somehow accounts for inflation, but while inflation seems pretty high there it doesn't quite balance out what I would expect

I think the money should just stay there and grow. Part of me is wondering if I should even be putting money of my own in India now too.

personalfinance,How should we go about saving for and/or financing a newer SUV?,"Hi all, I hope you can give me some good ideas. I apologize for any errors. I worried so much that I didn't get much sleep last night. My husband and I are 25. We live in WI. My husband and father put a new muffler on our '94 Jeep yesterday. My dad (a car guy of 40+ years who knows the in and outs of many cars) noted that we are going to need a new car/SUV within a year. Our frame is rusting away and will soon affect the motor. We need an SUV because we have a pop-up and already need more space than our Jeep Grand Cherokee has.

What is the best way to go about saving for a newer SUV? I had never looked up the costs of new SUVs before and didn't realize that if you want a reliable one with under 100,000 miles, you would need to pay $9,000+. 

We have about $6,000 in our savings(in a high yield Marcus savings account). We expect to get $6,000+ from our tax refund(our way of saving.....please don't judge) according to past years and the online tax calculator I did with my husband's W2(and I am a stay at home mom). We contribute $545.24 a month to our HSA($272.62 every other week) and have $2,378 in there now. My husband contributes 8% to his 401k and 4% to his Roth 401k(he just opened that Roth one this month). His employer matches up to 5% on 10%.

Their plan is that we need to get a new one by November...9 months away. I was thinking about almost stopping our HSA contributions or a while unless we suddenly empty out the HSA for emergancy care and slowing down or stopping the contributions to his 401K. We contribute almost $10,900 in 9 months between those three things I figure. He wanted to learn more about taking a loan from his 401K. I was pretty sure that was a bad idea. 

Or we could finance in some way? We have good credit (he is about 755; I am 785 but don't have a job), but a few places have told him his credit history isn't long enough (he never went to college or had a car loan). What kind of rate might we get? What amount of downpayment would be best in our situation do you think?

This is a bit complicated by the fact that I have a private student loan of $10,235 at 4.81% and $28,241 in federal loans on an IBR plan. For the private loan, they require $215. I pay $316. I was planning on using $2000 of our tax refund to go towards a new vehicle and put the rest to my private student loan. I'm doing the avalanch method, and if I don't use more of our tax refund, it would be paid off in April of 2020(and them all around September of 2022). I would think that a car loan rate would be less than the 4.81%???

I'm sorry for the long post, but I wanted to give a good picture of our options. What do you think would be a good plan for saving for a SUV while hopefully not sabataging my loan repayment plans? I would be happy to answer any other questions. Please go easy on me! This is our first time buying a vehicle. My parents were kind enough to gift us the two ones we have now.",finance

stocks,Ladybaybee's recommended picks for 2019-02-25,"[Link to imgur](https://imgur.com/a/pYnby8M)

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

HOW I USE THIS: I go for stocks with State equal to ready_to_buy because I make this to mean that the upwards tendency is just about to start so it has more potential to grow. State ready_to_sell isn't bad either, it just means that the system had detected the upward trend in previous days and it still thinks that the trend will continue this way. The system doesn't actually tell me how long the upwards tendency will be. I run the models everyday at noon NY time, so the programs just tells me: ""I think you should buy this TODAY"" or ""I think you should sell it TODAY"" Just as an added heuristic, I tend to sell all my stocks on Fridays because I don't like the uncertainty that weekends and long weekends bring, but that is just a personal opinion.

personalfinance,Help with financial plan for inconsistent income....need advice!,"Hey guys,

Started a throwaway account for several reasons but long story short, I have had a career in the film industry for years now that has provided substantial income but is very inconsistent. The new tax laws were an unexpected blow when I had my CPA meeting earlier this month and I ended up getting a much smaller federal refund than I am used to. This has left me in quite a pickle with some Credit Card debt as I usually wipe it all out with my refund and start fresh for the year. 

My main concern is to set up a paycheck plan where I use a certain percentage of each check and apply it to my financial goals for the year. They are:

* Max out ROTH IRA contribution
* Down payment for wife’s new car by end of year
* Prepare adequately for end of year lull in work
* Eliminate all Credit Card debt and cancel all but two cards (for rewards reasons)

I’ve always been too embarrassed to ask for help but I’m 32 and I really need to start figuring this stuff out. I’m a creature of habit so routine is absolutely key for me and having a set financial structure will eliminate a lot of stress in my life. I have set up a thresh hold system where once I fulfill a certain financial goal for the month, I move onto the next. I am conflicted if I should focus all my extra income for the month into the CC debt or start slowly putting my income into other goals at that point. Here is what I have started doing and any advice (books, resources, etc.) is greatly appreciated! 

And no, I don’t have any other plan for retirement at this point besides the Roth IRA. I know that needs to change but I don’t know whats available to someone like myself with no 401k option.

&amp;nbsp;

**THE PLAN FOR EACH PAYCHECK**

* 100% ^MONTHLY ^EXPENSES ^(mortgage, bills, etc)

*THEN (Monthly Expenses met)*

* 80% ^CC ^DEBT
* 10% ^ROTH ^IRA
* 10% ^WIFE’S ^CAR

*THEN (CC debt eliminated)*

* 50% ^ROTH ^IRA
* 30% ^WIFE’S ^CAR
* 10% ^RAINY ^DAY
* 10% ^EMERGENCY ^FUND

*THEN (ROTH IRA maxed)*

* 50% ^WIFE’S ^CAR
* 25% ^EMERGENCY ^FUND
* 25% ^RAINY ^DAY

*THEN (Wife’s car down payment fulfilled)*

* 50% ^EMERGENCY ^FUND
* 50% ^RAINY ^DAY

&amp;nbsp;

I know it’s not perfect, but at this point its a start. Again, any and all advice is appreciated is greatly appreciated! Thank you guys, this sub is amazing.

personalfinance,How to be smart with extra income?,"I'm 26 and just recently married. We are trying to start a family soon, so I am trying to take up an interest in being more financially responsible. Last month I finished paying off my student loans, the total balance was around $14,000 and it took me about 2.5 years to pay it off. So since that chunk of my debt is now taken care of, I'm trying to figure out what to focus on next. Here is a breakdown of my finances:

&amp;#x200B;

Savings Account - currently has a balance of around $4,000. Earning around 0.5% interest (Thinking about moving this to a higher yield savings account)

Retirement - Between my 403b and my Roth IRA, I currently have around $7000. My current contributions are around 11% of my income (10% to the 403b and 1% to the IRA). My company will start matching another 5% beginning in June, so by then my total retirement contributions will be around 16%

&amp;#x200B;

Debts:

Car - $15,800 owed with an interest rate of 3.5%

Retail Credit Card - $645 owed with a 0% interest rate (if paid by June)

Mortgage - We just recently closed on a house. The total price was $173,500, we put 6% down and just made our first payment, so our current balance owed is around 162,000 at a 5% interest rate. We are paying about $72 in P&amp;I insurance every month as well since we do not have 20% equity in the home.

&amp;#x200B;

My total take home pay is around $3000 a month. My total monthly expenses are around $2000. So with a buffer of about $200 for unexpected expenses, let’s say I have about $800 a month extra. I used to use that money to pay off my student loans, but now that's gone. So I'm trying to figure out how to make the best use of that money. In my mind, I've came up with 3 possibilities:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Put it towards the car. Since this is the lowest interest rate, I'm not sure if this is the best option or not. 
2. Put it towards the house until we at least we have 20% equity. So we can cut the 72$ a month we pay to P&amp;I insurance
3. Open up an investment account. I've been using Weathfront to handle my Roth, currently it's at about 7.4% Money Weighted Return over 2 years. So I would probably open up another account with them, unless there are better brokerage options? 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like if I can earn 7.4% on $800 a month in an investment account, this is the smartest option financially. Then I could turn around and use those gains to pay off debt in a few years. But I understand this option is  also the riskiest, so am I better off just using that money to pay off debt now? 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, my wife and I keep our finances separate for the most part. But I know she is way better off that I am. She has zero debt besides the mortgage and brings home around $3,700 a month. She also probably has around 20,000$ in savings in a low interest yield account like mine. She only contributes around 5% to her 401k so I've been trying to convince her to contribute more, even though her company doesn't offer a match. I know that she could be making much better use of her money but I don’t really know what to tell her she should be doing. What should we focus on?

personalfinance,Pay off loan or refinance?,"Hey PF! 

I (27M) am planning to leave my job in the next few weeks. I have already received a formal offer from a competitor and am working through the hiring process. 

As part of my current employer’s benefits package, I was able to receive a $5,000 interest-free loan to use towards purchasing a home, with annual deferments of $1,000 for 5 years. I accepted the loan in January of 2018 and have an outstanding balance of $4,000. The terms of the benefit indicate that upon termination/leaving, the loan converts into a “double-digit interest rate” loan (I have yet to confirm the exact rate but am told it is similar to credit card rates). 

My thinking is that I have two real options: 

1) I have the money in savings to pay the loan off completely, but it will take a majority chuck out of my rainy day fund. 
2) Refinance my mortgage or take out a loan to pay the balance. 

My new job will see a ~40% increase in salary and I could easily replenish my savings in 3-4 months with the additional income. I have no other debt and no dependents.

Loan 1:

Original Loan Amount = $10,900  
Interest Rate = 5.25% (Prime) + 6.5% (Margin) = 11.75% (variable)  
Payments to Date = $11,646  ($3k in principal, $8.6k in interest)

Loan 2:  
Original Loan Amount = $12,140

Loan Balance = $9,001

As you can tell, these loans are TERRIBLE.  I didnt realize how bad they were.  She is basically making payments just to keep up with interest, and not actually making any progress.

Other than pay them off faster, which isnt that feasible when the combined balance is almost $20k, What can I do?

When she begins working again, we've been thinking about using her salary strictly to pay off our student loans; if we do so, we could be totally done within four years. On the other hand, the housing market where we are is only getting worse, so we'd like to buy sooner rather than later, especially since apartment prices are way higher than mortgages right now. We could put her salary towards that goal for or year or so instead, especially since our loans are manageable. Still, the downside there is the paranoia I would feel at having both student loans and a house (because I know the mortgage is the lease of the associated costs), even if the math checks out on paper; plus, our loans are at the federal ~6% interest rate, which I think is fairly high. Which of these scenarios do you think makes the most sense?

A. Continue making normal student loan payments and put her salary towards large down payment/house fund for a year or so, and then switch to aggressively paying off the loans.


B. Split it; use part of her salary for the loans, so that they'll paid off in several years ahead of schedule. and part towards the house.


C. Throw everything at the loans until they're gone and then look towards a house, even if that delays it for several years.

Also I do need a decent car as I sometimes have clients in it) .  The monthly payment is $280 and there are 65 months left on the loan.  Since getting the loan in September 2018 I have made payments of $300 each month and recently started paying $500/month so I could pay it off faster. 

&amp;#x200B;

Originally my plan was to continue paying $500 a month towards the car and putting another $500 a month into a HYSA until I build up at least 6 months of expenses.  I am wondering if I should continue doing this, or if I should throw $1,000 a month toward the car loan to pay it off even faster.  

&amp;#x200B;

It is also worth mentioning that my income does vary and there will be some months where I will have more than $1,000/month to use toward my car loan or savings.  Maybe the better solution is to split the $1,000/month evenly between the car loan and savings, and use any extra toward the car loan?

Originally I thought a balance between paying off the loan and saving was the right idea but since the interest rate is 6.34% I would like some outside perspective.

personalfinance,Getting mixed answers on a loan rate,"I'll try to keep this as simple as possible.

Basically, I'm trying to get a $9,000 used car loan. My credit is about 810.

I spoke to someone at my credit union on Thursday and was told I would easily be approved. I gave them all the information and was told by that lady that I would hear back soon on official approval.

I heard back on Saturday morning and was told I was approved. I asked how much the interest rate would be and was told that best case it would be 3.9 and worst case probably closer to 4.9. (I have this call recorded) 

I went and picked out a car at a small family owned place my girlfriend's parents get all thier cars from. It was an 08 impreza. I got a $300 discount since I went with my girlfriend's mom and she knew the guy. Nice little plus.

Anyway, I couldn't get a hold of the lady, let's call her Jane, because I guess she has late Saturday to Monday off but I did speak with her earlier in the morning. So I called the general line for my credit union and was told that the interest rate would be 9%. I shrugged it off since I had a handful of other offers at the car lot pending. I assumed talking to Jane again would clear stuff up.

Monday rolls around and I'm really anxious to get this car. I tried calling Jane multiple times and couldn't get a hold of her. Finally I just drive to the credit union on my lunch break and ask to speak with someone else. I'm basically told ""She gave you false information, the absolute best we can do is 8.7"". The reasoning is essentially as follows.
1. Even though I have perfect credit, I haven't taken any loans before.
2. The value of the vehicle is much less than the loan, so the loan to value is messed up (the reason the vehicle is more expensive is because the lot it getting it from does about 3k of work on all thier Subarus before they sell them. Like I said earlier, my girlfriend's parents have bought several cars from this place, but they've never needed to take out a loan like I am.)
3. It's such a small loan that the interest needs to be high.

I basically tried to fight it and say ""I'm upset that. I was told 4.9, it influenced my decision."" I've already put 1k down on the car too. Not sure if that's relevant. I tried to talk to them more but ended up basically hitting a wall where they couldn't budge from.

My girlfriend's mom is advising me to really fight hard with the credit union. Ask to speak with managers, say that this is thier mistake not mine, etc and I just don't know what to do here. I really would like to get the loan down to a 5 percent interest because I'm already pretty strapped even though I make a lot. I make payments for my braces already that cost me $300 a month, and I know I can pay off this loan early too, but I'm just so worried about it.

Thanks in advance to anyone that can help me here!",finance
personalfinance,Advice on filing tax return with form 4852,"I am still waiting on a W-2 from a now defunct employer and have little faith they will be able to provide one.  IRS attempts to assist are being sent to an old address, so it doesn't look like that will turn up much.

In researching how to file without a W-2, I know I have to use Form 4852 but it doesn't look like there is any service that supports this form - even the fillable forms from the IRS website do not support this.  TurboTax does, but that will cost at least $120 to file even though I qualify for free filing for state and federal.

Has anyone had luck using a free service for this form? Or one cheaper/less evil than TurboTax?  Any recommendations on service or just the process for filing this form in general?",finance
personalfinance,Someone opened a credit card in my name and i don't know what to do,"I'm rushing to type (text) this because I'm at work so feel free to ask any questions and I'll get back to you asap. So I did my taxes with turbo tax (had to do a 1099-r so I had to pay for the deluxe version) and they had an option to check your credit report so sure why not. Im 27/m and never had any sort of credit due to being a drug addict and not caring about my future. Got sober about 2 years ago, a year into sobriety I bought a car (like as a gift to myself for not being as big a piece of shit now) and my credit history began. Fast forward to now and I want to refinance my car sometime because my interest rate is insanely high. So I want to start monitoring my credit. So I check into my credit report via turbo tax and that's when I see that someone had a credit card open in my name since 1997 (I was 6, so it wasn't me). I asked my mom and she said she absolutely did not do that and I should get that worked out. Lucky enough, there have only been 2 late payments the entire life of the account, and they were both in 2017. So that's great but of course it's subject to change at any time. I guess my main question is how to I go about removing that from my name/who should I talk to about this? Could just go to Chase and talk to an advisor there? Is there any way I could find out who opened it? Is it possible someone made a mistake and put someone's (with the same name) information along with my SS#? thanks in advance for your help",finance
personalfinance,Paying off Credit Card or Investing,"I have about 7800 in debt, but of that about 3100 is interest free (Paypal, Financed bed, and small loan from family), but those still have minimum payments. In total I have about $550 worth of minimum payments. My income after tax, bills, and min payment leaves me with about $1650. The only thing not included is food. I have about $2100 in stock with 1000 in my checking account. The 4700 debt is split across 4 different credit cards being about 1900, 1700, 700, 350.

&amp;#x200B;

My car insurance is paid for another 5 months, health insurance and gas for commuting is included in bills.

&amp;#x200B;

If I pulled money out of stock and added it to checking I'd have a total of about $3100 + the 1650 from my next paycheck. Is it better to pay down all the credit card debt as quick as possible to reduce interest? or would it be better to just pay down the debt with my monthly paychecks, say 1200 a month? My thought it paying off in order of debt on the card to free the minimum payments up, which could then be used to pay off the other cards quicker. But I wasn't sure if it would be worth selling off stock to also pay it down.

&amp;#x200B;

I get paid on Thursday but the next payment isn't due until the 9th of March.

&amp;#x200B;

\- When checking interest rates to see which to target first -&gt; Turns out the 1700 card is on a promo period with 0% interest until October. So if I liquidate I can pay off all interest debt on next paycheck, which seems like the consensus.",finance

personalfinance,Would love a few more sets of eyes on my financial setup!,"I've assembled my financial situation to this point using lots of research on this sub &amp; others. While I feel confident, I'd love some third-party evaluation &amp; a sanity check to make sure I'm on the right check. My goals are to move towards financial independence as soon as possible, and to generally maximize what we've got &amp; be in the best financial situation we can. I'm 28, wife is 26. My current setup is this:

**Spending / Expenses**

* We spend about $10K / month, and make about $20K / month. About 2.8K / month is the mortgage, but I'm working on setting up a budget to try decrease expenses. I've heard the best things about YNAB, so I'll try that first. A 50% savings rate is pretty good, but if we have kids, that'll change quick :) Given where our income is, we could be doing much better. Our expenses are too high.
* FWIW, we got married last year and we went on a honeymoon, which cost about $25K all told. So, removing that would reduce our expenses to around $8K / month, of which $5.2K is non-mortgage.

**Prime Directive**

* Rainy day fund in Ally savings account, $40K
* Maximizing our employer matches into our respective 401k's.
* We've got about $20K in loans, both student and auto, with &lt; 3.5% interest rates. I'm letting these ride, better investment opportunities elsewhere vs. paying them off.
* The mortgage ($417K loan, currently at $396K) currently has PMI on it, at $140 / month. I've had a hard time finding a source that fully answer my questions on PMI, but this is my number 1 priority. By my calculations, the PMI raises the effective rate to ~7% as long as PMI remains, so this is my main priority. We've got the cash, I'm just going through the appraisal steps required by the lender.
* We're also maximizing what we can both put in out 401k's and HSA's.
* At this point, we have some additional cash. I maintain ~$5-10K in my Schwab checking account, and plan to put any supplemental cash  into a Schwab portfolio of SWISX, SWTSX, and SWAGX. I have a Vanguard account as well, but I don't see a reason to use it over Schwab, today. Long-term, I like having it in the back pocket because it's investor-owned and that's pretty cool.

Note: All of our investments (including 401k's etc.) are roughly 60% US stocks, 30% INTL stocks, and 10% bonds. I'm fairly OK with maximizing returns &amp; taking on some risk.

**Credit Cards**

Here, it's a fairly simple strategy. I have a Chase Sapphire Reserve, wife and I both have the Chase Freedom &amp; Chase Freedom Unlimited cards. She's also an authorized user on my Chase Sapphire Reserve card. We both use the cards on the categories their most effective (Freedom for the 5% categories, Sapphire Reserve for dining / travel), and transfer all the points to my Sapphire Reserve so I can redeem that at 1.5X. We also have a Discover It for the rotating 5% categories, and the Chase Amazon card for 5% back on Amazon purchases.

Thanks to anyone that made it this far :) I have done a lot of research etc. on all this, and this sub &amp; others are incredible resources. I'd just like another set of eyes on this. Am I missing anything? Are there opportunities or risks that I'm not addressing? Am I doing something really dumb that I just missed because I've stared at this too long? Really appreciate any responses. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,ROTH IRA with high fees. How do I get out of this? (US),"Total newbie here, sadly at the age of 45.  My overall situation isn't that bad, so I'm not panicked.

A couple of weeks ago I decided to start throwing $500 into a Roth so I called up USAA and they set me up with their USAA Cornerstone Aggressive Fund.  Everything seemed OK, so I went with it.

Since then I've been devouring books on investing and I'm getting the info that my best option is to go for low cost index funds.  In a recent book I read, ""The Index Card"", it is suggested to avoid managed funds as the fees can be upwards of 0.89%.  Looking over the  paperwork for my new Roth account I see that I am paying 1.21%! 

So question time.  What's the best way to handle this?  Do I call USAA and just tell them to stop paying into this account?  If so, then what happens to the money in that account?  I know of Vanguard.  Can I just set up a Roth there?  

I know that some people have multiple index funds, but are these funds different or in addition to their IRA accounts or are they the same?  Can I have a Roth set up in different accounts or must it be all in the same place?  I feel like if I go through USAA or Navy Federal or any other band for that matter, that they will steer me to higher cost funds and tell me of the dangers of low cost index funds.  Also, I'm not married to the idea of a Roth; I just went with that because I'd heard of it.  

If it helps:  I'm in the Army and will retire in 10-15 years.  No TSP.  I have an emergency fund.  Very little debt (8K). 2 rental properties that produce about 2K positive cashflow monthly.  Currently renting due to the high cost area I live in (DC) and plan to invest the savings into a Roth.  



Bonus question:  on my fund summary in the performance section it says the highest this fund has performed is 5.83%.  Seems low right?",finance

personalfinance,Recent graduate looking for advice on an investment plan,"I graduated a few months ago and am starting to look into investing and maximizing my money for retirement.  I'm debt free, paid off my car, parents paid for my undergrad and I worked for my masters' tuition.  I'd appreciate it if people could offer advice on my current investment and savings plan. 

Currently :

1. I am maxing out my 401k (19K)
2. I am maxing out my HSA with company contributions (3.5k) 
3. I am auto saving 1.5k/month + \~12k in ESPP stock + 15k in RSU stock per year. (\~45k) 
4. I don't have a Roth IRA.  I will make just about 137k gross income this year with RSU added.  I'm not sure how to interpret the income limit. **Is it worth looking into this and doing a backdoor Roth?** 
5. I have \~50k in a capital one money market account (2% interest) 
6. My 6 month emergency fund would be \~25k, but I'd just move back with my parents if I ever lost my job and would rather maximize earnings for all of the money.

What I'm planning on/ questions:

1. Move savings account from capital one to ally.  2% -&gt; 2.2% and invest my savings into a no penalty CD (2.3%)
2. Interest rates are constantly rising, so I'm hesitant about, but also thinking of doing a 5 year CD ladder.  The increase in savings seems negligible unless I continue it for decades ...  **Is it worth the hassle?** 
3. I want to buy a house in the next 10 years, but live in the Bay Area. I want to purchase a house/apartment if a recession comes around, house prices dip and I am financially capable of affording one.  **Should I still start putting my money into an index fund?**

personalfinance,Tax refund offset question,"So, on the 22nd of feb, my federal tax transcript showed 846-refund issued with a pay date of 2-27, there were no other codes.  Today (2/25), my state refund (KY) was finally updated and it gave me a message about account in review because I owe a debt.  The debt in question is around 1200 for a student loan that I have contested with the KY revenue service already, and they released the levy placed against me a couple months ago.

personalfinance,Have some credit card debt with high interest. Is there a reason not to get a pay-off loan with a lower rate?,"I have a few credit cards with balances totaling about $9k. The interest rates average around 20%. Is there any reason using a service that helps you find a personal loan to pay these off at a lower interest rate is a bad idea? 

&amp;#x200B;

My other option is to pay these off about $500/month, maybe more starting when I get a raise next month.

personalfinance,Received 1099-R form late after filing taxes and receiving tax refund,"Today I received a 1099-R for a employee stock plan distribution from my old employer. It was sent by the company who manages the plan. It was postmarked January 31 but I didn't receive it until today. I have had problems with my forwarded mail being delayed several weeks or even months. 

The distribution was for $322. The taxable amount and federal tax withheld are both $0. The problem is, I didn't receive the distribution. My employer mailed a form in November to request a distribution or a rollover, but again, I received it a month late. The letter states the form had to be postmarked November 30 or it would be processed the following plan year. I mailed it back and selected a direct rollover into my IRA. I also wrote my new address but they still also sent my W2 to my old address. (I also gave them my new address when I left). I still have access to the site to get pay stubs and W2 forms so I was still able to get a copy of my W2 before it came in the mail (also late). My old 401k and my IRA are both managed by Fidelity so I arranged a rollover with them and I got a 1099-R online which I included on my tax return.

TL-DR: Received 1099-R form late, already filed taxes. Would the IRS be concerned about such a small unreported amount that wasn't and isn't subject to income tax?",finance
personalfinance,What to do with child's savings?,"I have 3 kids that are 15 or younger.  When their grandmother passed away, she left them about 25k each.  Currently their funds are stored between a savings account ($25 plus or minus) and 3 varying length CDs.  The interest rates suck and Ally bank would have a better rate just in a savings account.  My oldest is looking to be a truck driver when he gets older, so a 529 really doesn't work for him.  The other 2 are still too young to decide if college is in their future yet.

Where would you suggest to put their money.  I'd love to throw it in the market, but I don't want to manage it.  Bonds are OK, but then the money is tied up like CDs.

investing,Emerging Markets: Pain of 2019,"According to Bloomberg, if you lost money on emerging Asian bonds and currencies last year, don’t be surprised if 2019 brings more pain to investors as the first quarter approaches.

Almost all emerging Asian currencies are expected to weaken by the end of June, while bond yields are forecast to rise for countries including Indonesia, India and Thailand, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. In what could be an unwelcomed replay, risk assets are likely to remain at the mercy of the U.S.-China trade war, a messy Brexit and rising U.S. interest rates

“EM Asia is one in which we believe there is still pressure for yields to move higher and curves to steepen, based on our view of the U.S. Treasury curve,” said Roland Mieth, emerging-markets portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Singapore. “The overall outlook for EM Asia government bonds remains cautious.”

Asia’s biggest economy is already feeling the chill: retail sales are cooling and industrial profits are down, prompting policy makers to pledge more stimulus. Some reasons for emerging Asian assets are: oil prices have dropped about 40 percent from their October peak, which is a boom for countries that import the commodity. Central banks remain vigilant, while a growing number of analysts, including those at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS Group AG, say the dollar is close to its peak.

Meanwhile, positions betting the dollar will strengthen are near the highest in almost two years, which, to some traders, suggests the currency is set to decline. Moreover, emerging markets will be due a breather in 2019, according to a Bloomberg survey of 30 investors, traders and strategists. Stocks, currencies and bonds of developing economies have found a floor and will probably outperform their developed-nation counterparts this year.",finance

I don't believe I qualify for tax exemption due to a combined MAGI being approx $200K.

Is there any thing else I can do to reduce my tax liabilities if/when I should cash these out?

Should I cash just the half with the lower interest rate? Should I hold until maturity? Should I consider cashing out and putting into other investment (real estate income property?) Stagger the cash out?

I've managed to pay off over half my student loans in the past 2 years, and I'm down to about $14K left to pay.  I've also been careful with my savings and have $20k saved in the bank.

I have a handful of savings bonds given to me over the years by a family member. I just realized that some are mature!

I don't know anything about EEs other than what I have read in the wiki. My question for you lot is: should I hang on to the more recent ones since the interest rate is going up? Should I cash them all out and invest in an ETF? They most recent was purchased in 2000, so they've all at least doubled.

It's not a ton, but I want to do something with it, in the spirit of the family member who gifted them to me. I don't have any high interest debt, I'm not in school, and don't need the money for any expenses or anything so it's no skin off my back to let them cook a little longer.

Appreciate in advance the advice, sorry for the throwaway.

personalfinance,Fed Up With Rising Cost of Auto Insurance!,"I am guessing many of you are too.

I have an excellent driving record. No points, No tickets, No insurance claims.

I drive less that 3,500 miles per year.
I live in a rural area. Dover Delaware.
I drive a 2009 Chevy Impala. It just turned 60,000.
Bought used, had 25,000 miles when I bought it.

I am 64 years old. Male

Mostly drive local. Occasionally, I will drive 120 miles round trip. Never more than that.

The cost has risen every 6 months for approximately the last 8 cycles. When I call Geico and ask why it is always going up as opposed to a more, steady-state as it once was, they blame primarily 2 factors: All carriers are raising prices every 6 moths, and 2, They blame the rising cost on the state of Delaware itself.
As I said, I live in a rural area.

I have been with Geico for 9 years.

Last 6 month renewal the price increased to $542.5

The current renewal price is $558.10

My Coverage's are:

Bodily Injury - $300,000/500,000

Property Damage - $100,000

Additional Person Injury - $25,000/50,000

Uninsured Motorist Bodily Damage - $300,000/300,000

Property Damage - $10,000

Comprehensive Deductible - $100

Collision Deductible - $250

Rental Reimbursement - $30/day, $900 max

Yes, I realize car insurance cost are going up, for many reasons.

I have checked with Geico on changing coverage's, the difference between my current coverage cost and the lower coverage is so minuscule as to not warrant the change.

I have in the past contacted State Farm, Farmers Insurance, and Ameriprise (via a Costco executive membership)

The Amerprise quote does not offer coverage's at the 300/100 level or the other coverage's at that level or close to.
When I asked them to quote to the closest, their premium was not significantly different than Geico's. And I had to assume a considerably higher risk.

Has anyone changed from Geico? If so, to what? Was the change comparable in coverage and cost or better? Worse?

Looking for ideas for other providers. I have had it with this ridiculous rising cost of auto insurance to drive an average of 3,500 miles per year.

Thank you for your input.",finance
stocks,Ladybaybee recommended stocks 2019-02-26,"[Link to imgur with predictions](https://imgur.com/a/lsXfxSx)

**HOW I USE THIS:** 


1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**
I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

fintech,Could you pass a personal finance Stress Test? (fintest.co),"Hi all! I’ve been working for 5 years in banking, concretely, with the supervisory stress tests of banks conducted by the [Federal Reserve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp) and the BCE (in Europe).

A bank stress test is an analysis conducted under hypothetical unfavorable economic scenarios, such as a deep recession or financial crisis, designed to determine whether a bank has enough capital to withstand the impact of adverse economic developments. 

I was wondering why not to apply this process to the personal finance and I made Fintest (just a MVP). 

Fintest takes a holistic view of your finances to make sure you’re not only [financially stable](https://www.frugalrules.com/financially-stable/) but able to handle almost anything thrown your way. With this in mind, I’ve created a model which starting from macroeconomic scenarios and risk events (parameterizable), stress your money and push you into crash mode, and then, it will help you cope or recover from that.

I’m trying to fill this spreadsheet ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trnSlygwvvPW739b\_CJZS65mxoQMvseeuLr1m4WmnL4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trnSlygwvvPW739b_CJZS65mxoQMvseeuLr1m4WmnL4/edit?usp=sharing))  to know what other common situations could cause money stress in a ordinary person and what factors I should consider in my model to give a final score. Please, help me build the definitive list of risk factors or other ideas related to this.

I’m not concerned about how to monetize this yet, first I want to check if it can be interesting  but I have some ideas:

Option 1:

* Individuals plan: Saas Model. Free, standard and premium.
* Company plan: Saas Model. Free, standard and premium. (Not available initially).

Option 2:

* Free test with a rating and main conclusions of your finance in stress.
* If you want to a detailed analysis go premium, just XX $ a year, two tests a year or it there is important changes in the economy. Newsletter monthly with financial advices.

Create your own scenarios and risks events.

Option 3:

* Totally free and get commissions for affiliation marketing. (Finance programs, online banks, etc)

Any other ideas? Any advice is highly appreciated.

Thank so much!

personalfinance,Need help with deciding how to tackle partners debt and planning for future. Don't know what to do.,"Hello all!
First time posting here. I've been really stressed and unsure what to do so hopefully y'all can give me advice. Apologies, this may be long.

Background:
I am a senior student about to graduate with my bachelors. I have no debt, as I paid for school through scholarships and grants. I have a 20 hour a week job at the university that pays for my monthly expenses (rent, gas, food). I wanted badly to get another job since my university puts a 20 hour cap on student jobs, but because of my busy schedule (president of a club, board member of 3 other clubs) I cannot hold another ""real"" job. I have recently started delivering for UberEats, which nets me about $250-$300 (before gas) a week. This goes to savings (I have 450 right now, not much), my partner's credit card debt. I want to go to law school after graduating, preferably University of Washington. I live in Kansas right now so I planned on moving to WA (Spokane probably, cheaper than Seattle) and taking a gap year to get instate tuition and to retake the LSAT for a better score. I have 10,000 in a trust fund from grandparents. Moving to Washington will probably require me to take money out of the trust fund, but my policy has been to not touch that money unless completely necessary. I want us both to have job positions before we make the move (which would be this June), but of course there's no telling how the search will go.


My partner, who used to live in CO, moved into my dad's house on December (we've been long distance up till now. Been together almost 3 years). She has been having difficulties finding a full-time job, and has not been able to pay bills she has. My dad does not charge her rent. She's been doing part-time dog walking ($11 an hour, 11-15 hours a week), but has not been enough to cover bills. She recently (like literally today) got an actual job offer! (Walgreens, $9 an hour I think. She can do either part-time or full-time) So she will now be working full-time. She has about $22,000 in student loans (grace period ending in the next few months), and around $750 in credit card debt. I give her what I can to put towards the credit card since the debt is from a surgery of our pet bearded dragon. She has no bachelor's degree as she's skipped around school a lot. She has talked about going back to school with the credits she has and finishing up to get a biology degrees but I don't know if that's going to be possible until years later. She is a certified vet assistant though!


I'm really afraid of debt in general. Maybe to an irrational degree. I want to pay off at least most of her student loans before I go to law school. I know I will have to take out a good amount of loans for law school. I also am not going to work a job during my first year. I may do something on the side that is flexible like UberEats. So that means my partner will have to be supporting us. She has said multiple times that her debt is not mine, and that I shouldn't pay into it. But we are engaged and our finances will intertwine, so is it fair for her to say that she alone should handle this? It will affect me and I don't want to be in 5 figure debt in my 40s. I told her if we live poor and are smart, we can pay it off aggressively with our combined incomes. She says she's already accepted that she'll have debt for the rest of her life. As someone who worked their hardest to ensure they'd have no student debt coming out of undergraduate, I can't understand that mindset. 


Here are my questions:

Should I treat her debt as her debt alone and not pay into it? How would choosing this option instead of putting off law school for a bit and helping her pay it off ASAP affect me in the future? I want to marry her, this isn't just a random girlfriend. 


Is it stupid to put off law school to pay off debt? Am I worrying to much about paying it off quickly? I believe the interest rate is 5%. It's already accrued 500 in interest so...yikes. I know I will have student debt from law school, but would it not be wise to reduce the amount of debt held now before collecting more?


What do I do with the 10,000 dollars? Keep it as savings/an emergency fund? Pay off debt? I know it's not much but it's better than nothing.


Would staying in Kansas for a year be a more viable move than going to Washington immediately? MY father is selling the house, so we'd have to rent a place, but rent here is cheaper than Washington. My partner also has a job secured here, and it will be easier for me to find a job here than in Washington. We'd stay for a year, then move. This would give us time to pay off debt with less stress and money constraints, and we'd have more time to plan for the move. On the other hand there would be advantages in networking and working in Washington if I could secure a law related job there.


I've been incredibly stressed and feel like I'm just running around in circles, so advice and direction would be much appreciated. Don't be afraid to be blunt or harsh. I need all the help I can get. My partner and I are planning about having a discussion about our plans this weekend, so I will also talk to her about any advice given. Thank you.",finance

I just filed taxes for the first time as a 20 year old, full time college student. My 1090-T box 5 is around $68K in scholarships and grants whereas I only paid about $1900 total for tuition. I ended up owing NYS about $1300, with a net income of $25K due to internship money and working part time during school. I got $900 back total in Federal so that's a net debit of $400. Is this reasonable? I had net credit of $1200ish prior to the 1090-T being added. My parents think I should be owing NYS that $1300 despite me listing myself as a dependent but i'm not sure. Lastly, would a capital losses from investments of around $2K positively impact my return? I forgot to report that.

      1. From what I see on this subreddit, Vanguard seems to be a popular, low-fee choice
      2. Can I take my funds from my inactive ""Rollover Traditional IRA"" and place them into a Vanguard Roth IRA without penalty?
      3. Target fund vs. Self manage?
      4. Okay with moderate risk given age, but really just want my money to be doing *something*
   2. Other investments?

It boils down to whether or not I should stick with the guaranteed 3% rate and start fresh with their new adjustable rate guarantee. Or if I should rollover the money and take advantage of the ""potential"" higher credited rates.

&amp;#x200B;

Quote from the guide:

&amp;#x200B;

""Differences in crediting rates Existing contracts offer a rate guarantee of 3%. The new contracts provide an adjustable rate guarantee between 1% and 3%, determined annually. While the rate guarantee in your new contracts may be lower than the rate guarantee in your current contracts, there is a potential for higher total credited rates through the crediting of additional amounts in the new contracts which may be lower than the guaranteed rate in your current contract.2 This is because the adjustable rate guarantee in the new contracts allows TIAA to be more responsive to the prevailing interest rate environment.""

I currently have $40k in their traditional guaranteed plan.

I know its not good to just let money sit there and do nothing but, honestly I am a little stumped with what to do with it. I would really like to keep around 4-5k of it in one of my checking accounts just in case case of an emergency but the other 6k I feel could be used to really help me in the future. So here are my current Ideas:

1) Throw 5.5k into a roth IRA and then continue contribute to it over the next couple years. 

2) Use it to pay off some of my student loans. My worst lone is at 6.5% and has about 4k or so left to pay off. I also have 3 more loans each totaling about 19k but the interest rates on those is max 4%.

3) Use the money to invest in the stock market. Although Idk exactly how I feel as I am in the US and I am a little worried regarding the stability of the market given the current administration etc. 

4) Forget the safety net and look into maybe purchasing a property. I live in the Westchester area so more than likely it would be an apartment. I just don't know how I feel about being tied down to a place at such a young age.

The short of it is, a certain financing company associated with a certain auto manufacturer reported an account to Experian that belonged to my father, not me.

I contacted the financing company, who told me while ""Namey McNamerson"" (my father) was listed on the account as the primary account holder, ""Namey McNamerson Jr"" (me) was listed as the cosigner. The representative did concede that Junior's last 4 SSN matched my father's SSN, and not mine.

A rally was held in Tokyo, where participants demanded the return of the Kuriles to Japan. Against this background, a video that the BBC showed looks even more provocative. From the commercial of the Japanese government, it can be inferred that the Kuriles, supposedly, no longer belong to Russia. People in Sakhalin Oblast saw it and immediately responded.

On this day, February 7th, security is tightened at the Russian embassy in Japan. The police make sure the ultra-right nationalists don't approach the building. On the Day of the Northern Territories in Tokyo, they argue about our Southern Kuriles.

On February 7th, Tokyo officially held an annual convention, where the islands were discussed in the language of diplomacy. Maps are more eloquent than words. In this government commercial about the investment attractiveness of Japan (which the BBC broadcasts), the country added the Russian islands of Kunashir, Shikotan, Iturup, and Habomai. There's a gross geopolitical mistake among numbers and charts. But they don't notice it or don't want to notice it.

Mikhail Galuzin, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation to Japan: ""Recognition of the results of WWII is an essential factor of modern international life. It's because the UN Charter states that they aren't subject to any revision"".

The South Kuril Islands are visible with the naked eye from the Japanese coast. From Cape Nosappu on the island of Hokkaido, you can see both Kunashir and Habomai. It's a tradition to appreciate the islands from here in good weather. Here you can also buy souvenirs. The most popular one is a mug with the exact area of ​​each South Kuril island. At the same time, the locals are surprised by this attention from their neighbors. It hasn't been considered the outskirts of civilization for a long time: industry and infrastructure are well developed. The birth rate is increasing from year to year; families have lived on the islands for 3 or even 4 generations.

Alexander Verkhovsky, ex-member of the Federation Council: ""We need to show what we have there. Thanks to businesses, which created jobs there, and the state with its federal program, which created schools, kindergartens, and the transportation infrastructure"".

Vitaly Gomilevsky, deputy of the Sakhalin Oblast Duma: ""We just need to conduct a serious, well-organized, house-to-house poll of all of the residents of the Kuril Islands. I mean those people who live, work, and raise their children on those islands"".

Acting Governor of Sakhalin Oblast Valery Limarenko also supported the initiative to hold a referendum on the South Kuriles.

Valery Limarenko, Acting Governor of Sakhalin Oblast: ""The Kuril Islands are Russian lands. No doubt about it. I know the opinion of the people living on the Kuriles on this issue. We plan to conduct an open public poll of the residents to settle this discussion.""

Here's what the residents say.

""Our territory is our territory. There shouldn't be any argument about that"".

""Certainly, they're our Russian islands. I've been living here for 38 years. Guests are welcome here"".

They welcome the Japanese who come as part of a visa-free regime with great honors. This cemetery is one of the most important places for a Japanese delegation to visit. Relatives come to visit the graves of those who lived here until the mid-1940s.

worldpolitics,Double bottom of American biolabs,"Recently, the Pentagon has been actively deploying laboratories for the development of biological weapons on the territory of countries adjacent to Russia: Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan. Only in Georgia as of 2013, a system of 30 centers working on bio-threats under the supervision of WHO and USAID has been formed.

At official briefing held on October 4, 2018, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported that the Richard Lugar Center for Public Health Research, located in Tbilisi, under the guise of citizens' epidemiological surveillance, was developing biological weapons. According to Russian intelligence service, the object was fully created and funded by the United States.

About the underground orientation of the centers in Georgia witnessed the death of 73 volunteers who took part in the testing of a new drug in the laboratory in 2015-2016. “The almost simultaneous death of a large number of volunteers suggests that the Lugar Center is studying a highly toxic and deadly chemical or biological agent,” said Major-General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian radiation, chemical and biological defense forces.

The US has been testing biological weapons for many years. The reason for such close attention to the creation of this type of weapon is not accidental. A minimum of effort can lead to countless casualties among the population, comparable, only with the victims of a nuclear explosion. In this case, the possibility of contamination of resources is excluded, and the involvement of a state to the deed is unproven.

This is why the States spend billions of dollars creating such laboratories around the world. Although the first mention of objects involved in the development of biological weapons were right from the United States. Washington currently does not advertise the creation of such laboratories, disguising them as centers for the control of morbidity created ""for the good of taxpayers."" The exact number of such institutions in the USA is not known for certain, but over the past 10 years their number has increased significantly. So, if in 2001 there were about 30 such centers, then in 2012 there are already 389. Considering the ""new level of threat"" to the United States, the White House began to create a biological defense system (BSO) not only in the States, but also out of States. In particular, in Ukraine, Georgia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Burundi, Kenya, Uganda, India, Iraq, Tanzania, South Africa and other countries. The total expenses of the Pentagon for these purposes in 2012 amounted to more than $ 60 million.

The choice of countries in that list is not random: on the one hand, political instability in a number of states associated with revolutions or war not only makes it easy to assemble a biomaterial, but also to test it with impunity. On the other hand, the creation of such objects is a “constant source of biological threats” for the main geopolitical opponents of the USA in Eurasia - for Russia and China.

Centers located near Russian borders are of particular concern. Such US laboratories have been opened in Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. In 2016, in Armenia, with the financing of the Threat Reduction Agency under the US Department of Defense, were opened three bio laboratories: in Yerevan, Gyumri and Ijevan.

The result of such active growth of such centers is often unpredictable. Shortly after the opening of the Richard Lugar Center for Public Health Research in Georgia, the south of Russia suffered from the causative agent of African plague. Over three years, the direct losses of Russian agriculture from ASF amounted to about 5 billion rubles, indirect (from idle enterprises) - from 50 to 70 billion rubles. In 2012, Russian officials, including Russia's chief sanitary doctor, Gennady Onishchenko, publicly declared that the American center in Georgia was involved in the attack on Russian agriculture.

In addition to the proliferation of special dual-use centers near the borders of the Russian Federation, the concern of the Russian side is caused by the sharp intensification of the American military to collect genetic materials from people from different regions of Russia. On October 30, 2017, at a meeting of the Human Rights Council, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the United States is collecting biomaterials of Russians for unknown purposes throughout the country. Moreover, the bio data of the Russians were going quite openly. Thus, on the government procurement site of the Federal Business Opportunity, the United States Air Force announced the purchase of samples of the synovial membrane of Russians of the Caucasians. The main requirement for the purchase was the absence of “injuries of the musculoskeletal system, HIV, hepatitis B, C and syphilis. Gender, age and ethnicity were among the obligatory data indicated by donors.

According to military expert Anatoly Tsyganok, this type of activity is organized by the Americans to create a new generation of biological weapons. “This will be a genetic weapon of selective action. Its application is extremely difficult to identify and reveal, and human losses may be greater than with atomic bombing. ” The creation of such weapons is quite realistic, it is enough to recall the atypical pneumonia epidemic in China in 2002, when it was only the Chinese people and members of the Asian race who died from the SARS coronavirus, but not a single European was injured.

Thus, despite the fact that Washington in every way denies the involvement of its medical facilities in the creation of a new type of biological weapon, the Russian side’s opinion is unequivocal: the US is building up its military biological potential under the guise of studying means of protection and conducting other peaceful research, flouting international agreements. In this difficult situation, Russia needs not only to tighten the rules for exporting human bio-samples from our country, but also, in the case of a biological attack, to have at its disposal the forces and means of rapid response to stopping the epidemic.",energy

personalfinance,"First baby on the way soon, at a financial impasse and don't really know what to do. Listing out full financial situation, any advice would be greatly appreciated.","I'm sure this post will get buried, but it's worth a shot.

&amp;#x200B;

We're a couple in our late 20s, married about 2.5 years with our first child due at the end of May. I'm active duty military and she isn't working. Our total monthly income after taxes is $4522.04 right now, yet between my truck payment, the mortgage, and all of our bills, we just seem to be stretching pennies between paydays. 

My wife also has a leased 4Runner that we put $5000 towards last year which was distributed as a monthly payment over the last several months, however we're going to have to start paying towards it again in April, and it's $385 a month. We just can't afford it... when we entered into the lease, my wife was working and we were stationed at a location in Texas that had a much higher cost of living. Since then, we moved to South Carolina and one of my location based allowances dropped over $600 a month. That, coupled with my wife not working, equates out to us making almost $2500 less a month.

Bottom line, we want out of the lease. We have a family member that has offered to give us a vehicle for free. Its old, but reliable... and also very free. However, to buyout the lease its $30,165. We've gotten a couple of offers from dealers, the most being about $26,500. 

&amp;#x200B;

All that being said, we don't really know what to do right now. We have about $4600 all together from taxes and moving company reimbursements. We could bite the bullet on the 4Runner and sell it to a dealership, then have to cover about $3500 over their offer to pay it off.... Or we could pay off all of our credit card debt and hope that someone from Craigslist buys the 4Runner before we have to start paying on it again in April.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife typed up the following information. It may be helpful. If anyone has any advice, we would greatly appreciate it.

Currently we have $4,242.97 in the bank account from our income tax return and moving claim money. Also have an additional $350 in cash that we can get into the bank account if needed. So all together $4,592.97. 

If we use that money and pay off all credit card debt in FULL it will leave us with $1,125.99, but we would still have the 4Runner payment due in May. Conversely, we could sell the 4Runner and have about $1000 left over, but we would still have our credit card debt.",finance
CryptoCurrency,This is why we need crypto currencies... our current system is FUBAR,"Crypto currencies are needed more than most people realize. The latest episode of Our Foundations lays out the history and operations of the Federal Reserve and the modern banking system with fractional reserve banking and fiat money. If you aren't aware of how our current system works and how corrupt it really is, even at it's creation and down to the core structure, I highly recommend listening or doing some further research yourself.

Fortunately I have no debts to tackle. My idea is to contribute 50/50 of $12,000 between my emergency fund and my house downpayment fund until I have 3 months of expenses ($7,500) and then 25/75 emergency/house until I reach 6 months. I'm expecting my income to go up by $5,000-$10,000 next year to account for raise and full-year bonus, and then track inflation after that, maybe 1-2% faster; hopefully that'll allow me to increase my house savings more quickly. 


My goals:


-Afford the downpayment on as nice of a house as I can afford individually on a 30-year mortgage, without PMI, and hopefully without cashing out company stock.


-Save up company stock to eventually use for something (E.g. start a business, 529 trust for future kids, buy real estate to rent out, give to charity - or just keep growing it)


-Retire without too much difficulty


Does this budget look reasonable? Is there anything you would change about it or revisit?",finance
personalfinance,Taxing Bonuses,"I did some research and know that tax rates for bonuses can be calculated a few ways, even though there is one flat federal tax rate of 22%.

If a bonus is added onto a regular paycheck (and thus taxed at the normal income tax rate), and the income tax rate is higher than the flat tax of 22%, the IRS should be giving any overpayment as a refund. My question is: How does the IRS know 'x' amount of my Box 1 compensation was a bonus and therefore, should be taxed at its unique rate for the tax bill?

TIA!",finance
personalfinance,Tax return $ and ridiculous car payments,"This upcoming season, we will be getting a fairly significant (for us) tax return. I don’t have a solid $ amount on that though, since I have to file an injured spouse form every year due to his child support. My plan so far is to pay off all our CC debt (about $3000), and we will probably have to purchase a new refrigerator. Otherwise, I’m stuck. I would love to put some $ into savings, but we are being eaten up with car payment debt. 
One vehicle we bought about a year and a half ago, and I am on the loan with my husband. Unfortunately we need a super reliable vehicle in order to get our son back and forth to Atlanta for doctor appointments, and this is both the most comfortable and safer of the two cars. The other vehicle is just in his name- this is what I need help with. He agreed to a 16% interest rate on this car, so we are significantly upside down on it. It’s about $300/mo. The car’s NADA value is about $5k, and our payoff quote is $9800. Is it worth it to just give it up and buy a used car outright with whatever is left if we’re just going around town and back and forth to work? I don’t understand how surrendering a vehicle with a loan on it works, and while I understand we may be stuck paying the difference, I’m not sure if we would still gather interest on it. 
My husband’s credit is already tanked between debt to income, missed payments, and his child support, so I’m not super concerned about saving it right now. Is refinancing either car even an option? Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I have a single missed payment on the car with my name on it, so I think I understand I wouldn’t qualify to refinance that one, but I don’t even know how that works either. I’m getting ready to start a more stable job, so I’m trying to look ahead to get us out of debt as much as possible. 
Thanks so much.

worldpolitics,Doria Sachs,"Goldman Sachs is being overseen by the Doria and Sacchetti banking families of Italy. Their combined names translated from Italian mean Gold Sachs. The Doria name derives from de Auria and Aureo or D'oro which are Italian words for gold. The Doria family started out as a banking family from Genoa. Marquis Marco Doria the Count of Montaldeo is a top member of the Doria family today and he was Mayor of Genoa from 2012 to 2017. The Sacchetti and Sachs name both mean bags or sacks. Italian nobility usually have the highest authority in society through Rome's network of power. Marquis Marcello Sacchetti was a merchant banker that was the treasurer of the Apostolic Chamber for the Vatican. The Doria family ruled in the Genoa Republic which was a major banking empire with its Bank of Saint George founded by the Grimaldis which are married with the Dorias with Doge Giovanni Doria of Genoa who was the son of Agostino Doria and Soprana Grimaldi. There are numerous Jesuit educated top executives working for Goldman Sachs as well as Vatican knights. Peter Oppenheimer is on the board of directors for Goldman Sachs and was Jesuit educated from Santa Clara University. Lakshmi Mittal is another member of Goldman Sachs board of directors and he was Jesuit educated from St. Xavier's College of Kolkata, India. Mark Carney is the Governor of the Bank of England and worked for Goldman Sachs for 13 years. Mark Carney was Jesuit educated at St. Francis Xavier High School. Edward Gerald Corrigan was a former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was Jesuit educated from Fordham University, and is currently managing director in the Office of the Chairman at Goldman Sachs and is Chairman for Goldman Sachs USA. Debora Spar was on the Board of Directors for Goldman Sachs and she went to Georgetown. Robert Agostinelli is an Italian-American billionaire and banker that worked as a senior partner for Goldman Sachs and later founded Rhone Group. Agostinelli was educated at the Roman Catholic St. John Fisher College and he is a top member of the Friends of Israel Initiative and also worked for Jacob Rothschild. Princess Marina of Savoy is from the Doria family branch called the Maria Ricolfi-Doria family and she married Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV of Savoy the current head of the Italian royal family. The Savoys live in Switzerland where banking is private. The name Savoy refers to savings. They accumulate wealth and save it in private Swiss accounts.   

The Roman born Mario Draghi who is President of the European Central bank, board member for the Bank for International Settlements, and member of the G30, was Jesuit educated from the Massimiliano Massimo Institute in Rome. Mario Draghi previously worked as vice chairman and managing director of Goldman Sachs International. Peter Sutherland was a Vatican Knight of the Order of St. Gregory, Jesuit educated from Gonzaga College, Bilderberg member, former Director for the Royal Bank of Scotland, and Director of the GAAT and he worked as non-executive Chairman of Goldman Sachs International. Geoffrey Boisi is a Roman Knight of Malta, Jesuit educated from Boston College, member of the Trilateral Commission, Trustee for the Papal Foundation, and worked as a top executive for Goldman Sachs for decades as well as JP Morgan and Freddie Mac. Eileen Rominger was Jesuit educated from Fairfield University, Director of Investment Management at the United States Security and Exchange Commission, and she was the Global Chief Investment Officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The head of the Sacchetti family today is Prince Urbano Sacchetti of Rome along with Marquis Marcello Sacchetti, and Marchesa Giovanna Sacchetti. The head of the Doria family is Prince Jonathan Doria Pamphilj and Princess Gesine Doria Pamphilij who were adopted into the family so they work under Marquis Marco Doria and Princess Marina of Savoy. Prince Jonathan Doria-Pamphilj is also a major pedophile that molests little boys. Another official member of this family is the wealthy businessman and politician Joao Doria the current Governor of Sao Paulo in Brazil. The Doria family also married with the Landi family with the Landi di Chiavenna family with Giovanni Landi Di Chiavenna and his sons Ludovico and Manfredi. Antonio Zanardi Landi is an Italian ambassador to the Holy See and Order of Malta and his wife is Sabina Cornaggia Medici Castiglioni of the Medici banking family. Landi refers to land. Gold and silver are mined from land owned by rulers like princes and monarchs. Landowners are above bankers and employ them.

The estate was valued at anything from 950m to well over 1billion, but as the art collection can’t be broken up and with any tax consequences in a sell off, Sunday Times Rich List valued the Pamphiljs at 500 million dollars.

personalfinance,Student loans amortization schedule calculator with custom payment amount?,"Hi,

Does anyone know of an online calculator that will break down how my student loan balance will change over time that will allow me to put in my own payment amount?

I've found the BankRate one that gives an amortization schedule, but it doesn't let me play with numbers as much as I want. I can only put in my loan amount, interest rate and loan terms, and it decides the payment. 

I've also seen the prepayment calculators that help you see how paying extra can change your interest and how long it takes, but none that I've found break it down monthly like I'm wanting.",finance

The above link says FERS-FRAE pension personal contributions (4.4% for any employee hired after 2014) can get their money rolled over if they leave federal employment before Retirement. It says interest on contributions is paid at government secuirities rate. Would this essentially be G fund in TSP?

Already Got State Return,"Pretty much as the title, I submitted my taxes through TurboTax in late January and I received an email from TurboTax stating that my taxes were accepted by the IRS. However it has been longer than the 21 day period the IRS tells you not to call checking about refunds. When I check the IRS ""Where is my Refund"" it still lists my taxes as processing. I filled single making around $32K and I have not had any issues in years past where I've been stuck in taxes limbo.

stocks,Ladybaybee recommended picks for 2019-02-27,"[Link to imgur](https://imgur.com/a/HJKrB3V)

**HOW I USE THIS:** 
1) All the stocks identified in the table are qualified as “BUY” opportunities.

2) I focus in the column “Success Rate(3m)” which shows the precision of the agents in the last 3 calendar months. I personally feel most comfortable with Rates 0.8 or higher. 

3) Then, I see the number in “Tx(3m)” which represents the number of transactions that the agents predicted for this stock in the last 3 months. I prefer stocks that have had at least two transactions during this period. 

4) Finally, I look at Growth(3m), if the agents have had a considerable growth (&gt;5% in 3 months) then I follow that trade. 

5) If a row in the table is colored green then it means that stock has been on the rise today so I purchase it immediately in order to ride the wave up. On the other hand, if the row is colored red, then I wait out until very close to market close to purchase the stock and let the price bottom out before climbing up again tomorrow.


6) After I purchase the stocks, I ALWAYS set a stop loss order at -2.5% from my buying price valid for the day. I think this is good hygiene, no matter how confident I am of my system, I still want to make sure that my losses are capped. I update this stop loss order every day. 


**BACKGROUND**
I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this stock then you should … The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(1 Year)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past calendar year. The column “Tx(1Yr)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last calendar year. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past calendar year, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on.

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions.

personalfinance,Car loan interest rate is 4.6%. My credit is super good. Can I lower this somehow?,I have about $5k left to pay off on this bad boy. I'm only 21 so I'm not too knowledgeable about the world of money yet. Any advice?,finance
personalfinance,Trying to figure out what's best to prioritize,"Hi all,

Back in August, I got a full-time job making $51k a year after graduating in May 2017. I work in media, so this is pretty decent for someone of my level just starting out, but unfortunately, I still have a huge pile of debt. My paychecks end up being around $1300 bi-weekly after my insurance, 401k, and taxes are taken out.

The first thing I did was refinanced and consolidated my multiple Sallie Mae loans with Citizen's Bank, reducing my interest rates from 12% to 7.23% and selecting a 20-year term. I began repayment in December at $550/month. In December though, I paid an extra $200. For March, I was planning on paying an extra $250.

But then I began thinking about my other debt. I have a total of $104k in student loans. My private is $68500, and my federal are $36000. I had signed up for the income-based-repayment program with my federal loans a few months before obtaining my full-time job and haven't updated because I wanted to build a savings of at least two months of rent. My payments are $73, and that amount is not covering all the interest.

To break down all my debt:

|Citizen's Bank|$68500|7.23%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Federal loan 1|$3,653.71|3.610%|
|Federal loan 2|$2,384.60|3.610%|
|Federal loan 3|$4,769.12|3.610%|
|Federal loan 4|$4,631.68|4.410%|
|Federal loan 5|$2,378.14|4.410%|
|Federal loan 6|$4,756.28|4.410%|
|Federal loan 7|$5,647.60|4.410%|
|Federal loan 8|$2,254.61|4.040%|
|Federal loan 9|$5,628.48|3.510%|
|Credit card 1|$600 at 25.99%|min. payment $27|
|Credit card 2|$2,241 at 23.99%|min. payment $70|
|Credit card 3|$845 at 24.99%|min. payment $27|

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Should note, my parents don't give me much, but they do help with my CC payments since some of what I owe is because I helped them financially. For example, a lot of the time when I pay CC #2, I make a $100 payment. My parents will match that payment with CC #3. 

I currently have $1800 in savings. My rent is $900 (I live in a major city with roommates and on a lease until August), which I already have set aside along with Citizen's Bank minimum payment of $550. The rest in my spending account is \~$1268. I have plenty of groceries to last me until my next paycheck in a little over a week. I work entirely from home, so no extra costs in coffee, lunch, or transportation there. I've thought extensively about leaving and subletting my apartment for a few months to throw what would be my rent money to my debts, charging an extra $50-100 as I can leave it furnished, while I live with my parents 3.5 hours away. I cannot leave entirely though as my job expects me to be in the city, but I think I could manage it for 2 or maybe 3 months. I do have a gym membership for $20/month, but I'd like to keep that as I tend to go there to be able to leave the house for a bit when I'm low on money, and it helps with my anxiety.

I feel enslaved by this debt, and I just want to work aggressively to pay it all off while I have some breathing room in my bank account to do so. I always feel the need to put all my extra money to my student loans, but given what I've read on here and their interest rates, it seems smarter to aggressively pay off the credit cards instead first and then to the loans. I'd also like to hear some input on what I should do payment wise for my federal student loans as it seems right now they're just continually growing.

personalfinance,"Pay off Student Loans, Build Emergency Fund, or Save for Retirement?","I'm a 23 year old recent college graduate with approximately $38,000 of student loan debt (Weighted average interest rate on the debt is 4.47%, with most of the loan being at a fixed rate). I have a relatively stable job and about 3-months expenses saved. I have about $1,480 of surplus each month to work with after all my expenses including the minimum payments on my student loan. I'd also like to purchase property some day.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I:

A) Put surplus money into my emergency fund until I hit 6 months expenses?

B) Use surplus money to aggressively pay off my student loan (for a guaranteed annual return of 4.47%)?

C) Contribute the money to a Roth IRA, which is expected to return 6-7% annually, which is higher than the 4.47% rate on my student loan? (I've read that you can take $10,000 of contributions out of a Roth to make a down payment as a first time home-buyer, but don't know the other logistics) 

D) Some sort of combination of the three? (I've been doing this for months because I don't know which is best for me)

personalfinance,First time being in a position to negotiate a raise. I don’t know what I’m doing. Please help.,"Quick background. My job has annual raises, generally a standard 3% raise. This year, I have a new manager who, during my review (and apparently in other people’s reviews), gave me a lot of praise and has used me as the standard setter. He told me that he doesn’t give the raises, but can help if he thinks someone deserves a bigger raise. He pretty much told me to expect the standard, but if I think I should get more to come talk to him. I obviously think I deserve more than the standard...hence this post. 

My main reasoning behind why I think I’ve earned more than the standard is that I do more work than everyone (save for one guy) who works in my department. I know it, they know it, and my boss knows it. In fact, my boss has asked me before why I can do so much more work than the others. He asked me this because two days in a row (there have been others) we were short staffed and I was covering the tasks of those who were out. I managed to get all of their work done AND my work done. They barely get their stuff done during a full work day when they are there. 

Second, I take on many extra tasks to help move the company in the direction that they want to go and have even brought ideas on how things can be done more efficiently. Saving money through time and safety. 

I’ve been able to calculate how much I’ve saved the company do to some saving measures I’ve implemented and recommended, but I’m not sure how to calculate (or if I can calculate) how much value I bring due to the fact that I can generally do my job and the jobs that we split between two others. 

Is it fair to take the average salary and double it for value I bring? For instance if salary is 25k can I say I add 50k value to my department? I do my job and frequently the jobs of two others meaning I can do the work of 3 people. 

If, through the things I’ve implemented and the daily work I do the value adds to 100k would it be fair/justified to ask for a 15k a year raise or the equivalent? Or just a 15% of whatever the total values I’ve brought about. 

I could use all the help I can get.

gaming,do most people realize when companies say things they 'think' about the future its just to promote their market interest and get people to agree with it even if its not really true at all?,"like, when EA said people dont want single player games, when the fallout/elder scrolls shills call you names for criticizing design decisions that are well documented and agreed with by thousands of people and clearly arent edgelord shit, when companies say ""Software As a Service is the future""

consumers have the unequivocal and absolute power to totally shut down their idea or vision of the future if they simply disagree and dont support them.

even if they base their decisions on metrics they have collected, you cant consider it a scientifically accurate study due to inherent bias and the fact they arent comparing different metrics that affect things, looking only at what they make money best with and not considering how others out-do them.

essentially what i suggest is their statements are what they wish to be the future out of selfishness.

instead they wish to create the correct market climate in which to maximize earnings of their current business plans. Its basically PR 101 here. Your taking a subject most people hate and disagree with and twisting it into something that seems agreeable and attractive using the right kind of wording to evoke certain emotions in the listener.

I am a master of manipulation in personal life, so i can see a conman coming 100 miles away, and i can judge a mans character and profession easily. Underworld life, to me, was my life for a long time. I avoided the law effectively and efficiently acting as a shadow. I could always identify who would sell me out and who wouldnt because of this, and always maintained control like a sociopath just like an efficient businessman (until rebellions crushed things as they do in that lifestyle, cant trust anyone or call them a true friend like that in that world)

this isnt really about gaming alone, its about business and consumer awareness. like, are most people extremely vulnerable to marketing manipulation and only some crazy people like me resistant and aware of what they are doing?

Like i dont need to listen to the words they say, to know they are just as soulless as me or anyone else when doing what they have to do. Im well aware of the origins of the PR industry (rockefella started it to lie about how evil he was and used it to do things like instigate prohibition and develop an oil and chemistry monopoly) As well as the dangers of marketing psychology and the few psychologists who dared speak against what is happening in capitalism who were pretty much stricken from the college textbooks -- and stuff like sociological theory of mental illness (basically theories that suggest societal organization, not the individual is responsible for the unfortunate events of modern life -- these were also taboo in the studies of anthropology  and animal behavior for many, many years because it was a major potential threat to the organization of government and culture)

like do people active realize they are being fed bullshit any time a TV is on or a corporation spreads its bullshit speeches anywhere? I dont think they do, because people still invest in pointless kickstarters that are unrealistic with no underlying understanding of the science behind what they invest in, and also the fact that these tactics seem to be successful

Like you can tell when something is a real passion project because none of that shit ever happens. Like i think every beer commercial ever was a complete joke and the beer they advertise is crap quality made from the lowest quality ingredients that wont make any women come near me -- also I know its more likely to get stolen at a party if i buy shitty tasting beer because people are so manipulated by the marketing they are scared to try the good stuff. You can literally have alcohol that tastes like raspberry cheese danish in an ""old person bottle"" and nobody will touch that shit. but you buy a 30 rack of bud light with lime and the whole thing is stolen from under you.

this kinda behavior always made me question reality. really only the really rich or high up criminals tend to have quality taste in luxury items such as alcohol. I once met a Pimp who had good taste.",technology
investing,Everything is not alright,"We have bounced back hard since Christmas with a hint of fed funds rate increases stalling and the possibility of a trade deal with China.

On the other hand, there are still signs the economy has cracks. Lumber rallied, only to fall again and housing starts just had a terrible number. Was it weather or is the housing market cresting?

The comparables for 2019 may fail to match them, no matter what the broader economy does. Price to sales is above 2. Price to book is above 3. Buybacks were huge drivers of the market in 2018.

btc,Bitcoin &amp; IRS Auditing - A Podcast Discussion,"I recently interviewed Alex Kugelman, a tax controversy lawyer - I asked him about IRS audits in relation to crypto trading. Below is a link to the podcast interview itself, as well as a summary I wrote up. Thought this would be a good place to post (let me know if I'm wrong about that).

[BitcoinTaxes Podcast Link](https://bitcoin.tax/podcasts/5c6ef3e3c0508cad6e884212/audit-irs-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-taxes-alex-kugelman)

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights:**

IRS  audits are a real possibility for anyone who has traded   cryptocurrencies. Our guest today is Alex Kugelman, a tax controversy   lawyer with an abundance of knowledge concerning cryptocurrency audits.   He's here to share his expertise on IRS cryptocurrency audits,  including risk reduction strategies as well as enforcement predictions  and misconceptions.

**Alex  Kugelman specializes in IRS audits. His experience  includes four years  of Federal government court experience at the U.S.  Tax Court and a  U.S. District Court.** *\[00:40\]*

Alex:  I'm an attorney out in California. I clerked for a US District  Court  judge and as well as the United States Tax Court. I've been in  private  practice exclusively doing tax controversy work for the past  five years  or so. I kind of got involved with crypto towards the end of  2016. I  tended to represent clients mainly with compliance &amp;  disclosure  issues with respect to cryptocurrency. I just really like it.  Really  interesting area.

**The Coinbase summons in 2018 played a major role in Alex's interest in crypto audits.** *\[01:19\]*

Alex:  What started me into the crypto space was when the IRS first  issued  summons for Coinbase. We started getting some interesting calls   regarding that. And at that time I thought to myself, this might be an   interesting area. So I started following the actual summons enforcement   proceeding at the District Court here in San Francisco - from there  kind  of worked with people under different types of compliance,  including  international disclosures. Now we're starting to see some of  the first  cryptocurrency audits come through.

**First, let's get a brief rundown of how IRS audits work.** *\[02:00\]*

Alex:  It is important to understand the IRS as an administrative  agency and  all different layers of it. So when it comes to an audit the  term that  the IRS uses is an examination and there's three basic levels.

The  first is a correspondence exam. That's where you get a letter  that  says, dear taxpayer, so-and-so reported that you had $100 of  interest  income that wasn't on your tax return - we're going to increase  your  tax. If you want to challenge that, you can. And that's basically   termed an under reporter notice. That's probably not going to be a   cryptocurrency audit if you get that notice.

The  next one is an office exam. That is someone in the local IRS  office  sending you a letter that says, we have selected a certain tax  return  for audit and we're going to look at these issues. We'd like you  to  call us to schedule an appointment. That's going to be usually a tax   compliance officer that is doing that.

The  third and probably the most serious level of exam is a field   examination. That's also going to be a local IRS representative,   typically a revenue agent. There, the revenue agent may come to your   work or ask come to your work or business to kind of conduct the audit.

All three of those are going to start the same: a letter that's sent to you at your most recent address provided to the IRS.

**Cryptocurrency audits follow a similar protocol.** *\[05:40\]*

Alex:  I think it's likely that most crypto audits are going to start  with  one of two things happening. One is that there is information from  the  Coinbase summons that is inconsistent with what was on a taxpayer's  tax  return. I think for someone who's involved with that issue, they're   going to have a good sense of that one because they should've gotten an   email notice from Coinbase.

Or two, the  audit notice is going to identify older tax years - 2013,  2014 or 2015  because those are the years that the information related  to.

Another  reason I think people will get audited is going to be because   information on the return is incomplete, in the sense that the taxpayer   or the cryptocurrency owner reports some transactions, without enough   detail to figure out the actual cost basis.

**Does reporting your data in an aggregated fashion increase your chances of being audited?** *\[06:45\]*

Alex:  I mean one - to the extent that there's going to be a lot of  taxpayers  - a lot of people use TurboTax, right? If that's the way  TurboTax is  preparing all of those returns, it would seem to me you're  kind of in a  herd of people like that. And at least it's consistent with  what a lot  of people are doing. The second part of that is going to be  at least  those people who have prepare the returns in that manner,  they're going  to, or should have, the underlying data. So even if it's  an aggregate  reporting of each asset class as opposed to each individual  trade, if  there ever were questions then you're going to have your CSV  files,  you're going to have your Bitcoin.tax exports, you're going to  have all  the information that you need to back that up.

**Alex is an advocate of over-reporting your information to the IRS.** *\[09:30\]*

Alex:  I'm a big proponent of over-reporting - and I don't mean paying  too  much tax. I just mean including too much information. Because at  some  point there's kind of two ways that your returned can be flagged: a   computer flags the return for some reason or there's a special unit or a   person who actually flags it. At the end of the day, a human being  will  be looking at that return and deciding whether it actually is  going to  go all the way through to an audit. I want them to completely  understand  what's being reported, why it's been reported, and if  there's too much  information, that's fine - it's less likely that  someone's going to have  more questions.

**A crypto audit is very likely to be a field exam - and it's important to hire a good rep.** *\[11:00\]*

Alex:  It's very likely going to be a field exam, which means you're  going to  have a revenue agent - and those are kind of the best of the  best  auditors for an IRS audit. And remember - an IRS audit is a civil   matter. It is not criminal at this point. Again, it's unlikely that it   will become criminal. It is, however, the highest level of audit you're   going to get.

If you're going to hire a  representative, which you have every right  to do, you should contact  that person, let them know what's going on and  probably have them  interface with the auditor. You should receive, as  part of the opening  notice or letter, the information document request -  which is  identifying what things to bring for the auditor. Also, it'll  tip to  what topics might be important. For example the typical things  you're  going to see will be bank statements, financial or asset account   statements, which I view as requesting exchange statements or exchange   CSV files. Any documents that show the cost basis for your   cryptocurrency trades.

**Audits are more art than science.** *\[13:35\]*

Alex:  The auditor has a fair amount of power. So if you play real  hardball -  that's not going to prevent the auditor from expanding to  other years.  So when you get that audit notice ,and let's say that  you're going to  deal with this yourself, the first thing you want to  kind of figure out  is what are the areas that I wouldn't want to go  into, and what are  the areas that I don't have good records? That will  help guide the way  to respond or what information to pull together.

The  reality is, and let's just be honest here - for most people  reporting  cryptocurrency gains, they have all of the information. The  IRS does  not have much. They might have some records from Coinbase, but  it's not  as if they have a treasure trove of third party data.

The burden is really going to be, in every audit, on the taxpayer to prove their tax return is correct.

**It's difficult to say how lenient the IRS will be regarding past years.** *\[15:35\]*

Alex:  I think the way that I would look at it is that maybe the  standard of  of records required to really substantiate older years might  be a  little bit lower for older years as opposed to now because it's   different now. There's a lot better information provided by some of the   exchanges. There's a lot more software out there to help you,  especially  for people who are newer to crypto. You should have access  to all your  bank records. You should still have a lot of emails,  reflecting  on-ramping off-ramping, or other purchases. You should be  able to kind  of pull this all together.

I  can understand when we have clients who come in and are early  adopters  and they're missing chunks of information. So I do think that  in those  types of circumstances, yes, I think there would be a little  bit of  leniency. But I don't think if you're asking, hey, I reported my  gains  in 2017 but I never really did it 14, 15 or 16 - I don't think  that's  going to be viewed very favorably.

**It is possible to substantiate your data without all of your records.** *\[19:00\]*

Alex:  I think the first thing is, I mean, outside of cryptocurrency  and just  generally in audits, how many people have complete records to  support  everything on their tax return from three years ago? Right? It's  just  not the reality.

The best source of  information in a lot of these cryptocurrency  clients are the clients  themselves. They kind of know what they did and  they can remember.  There's some who take good notes and other people  don't, but as you go  through and ask people: what exchanges have you've  been on, what type  of coins, if you bought any ICOs, have you ever sold  for actual US  cash, and have you ever bought goods or services? As you  talk through  things people tend to recall what happened. We use that  information and  we cross check that against bank statements, as well as  CSV files, to  pick out what those transactions look like.

Most  people have some sort of records, at least reflecting the  transfer in  and the transfer back out of that exchange. So you can use  historical  data and historical pricing information to essentially  estimate what  that transaction would have been. And then what we do is  we provide a  written statement summary of what we're doing and why we're  doing it.

The  other big one that we see all the time - and anybody listening to   this, please hear this, do not trade for your friends on your exchange   accounts - because that type of commingling causes such major problems.   Essentially you are walking into those taxable gains just because  you're  allowing someone access to the exchange to make sales.

**If you need representation for an audit, get representation.** *\[23:00\]*

Alex:  My general rule is that I think experienced representatives are  really  important. I probably would not hire the CPA that prepared my  return  unless they were: one, experienced with being a representative in   audits. And two, you felt comfortable that they weren't going to go in   there with a conflict of interest. But I do think if you're worried   about going into audit - hiring a skilled, and experienced rep is   really, really important.

If they're  experienced with this, they should understand the  appropriate ethical  standards and go in there and  essentially help  resolve portions of the  audit and move it to a resolution that you can  deal with.

Taxpayers  actually have a lot of leverage in an audit. And that  sounds crazy to  say, but there is a lot of truth to that. And so as  you're kind of  working through the audit itself, you want to make sure  that you're not  just agreeing to something to be done with it. You're  not agreeing to  something just because you think that you'll get in more  trouble or get  a worse result otherwise.

**There are important risk-reduction strategies you can utilize to avoid a crypto audit.** *\[28:15\]*

Alex:  The first thing that you really want to do, is just assess; for  those  of you that are really worried about an audit - just assess what  it is  you've actually done over the years. When did you start trading,  what  exchanges were you on, do you have records that reflect on-ramping  and  off-ramping? And that's going to be your bank account statements. Do   you know where you've been, what exchanges you've been on?

For  foreign exchanges, there may not be as much of that AML &amp; KYC   compliance, but I really believe that you do have reporting   requirements under FATCA for FBAR and something called an 8938, which if   you listen to the podcast with Tyson, he kind of explains what that  is.  But it's basically if you have ownership of a foreign bank account  or  asset, you have certain reporting requirements, whether you've had   income or not.

You want to make sure you  at least track  when you've actually  exchanged crypto for cash or vice  versa. That's partly because that's  one of those areas where when  people can get in trouble with some sort  of federal investigators -  because those types of transactions can be  potentially considered money  laundering.

For those who believe that  they've used like-kind exchange rules to  defer taxable gains -you  should look on your tax returns to see if you  filed the form 8824,  which is where like kind exchanges are actually  reported. That kind of  goes back to the over reporting issue I was  talking about before. I  think that if you didn't report the actual  trades that you're taking  like-kind treatment for in past years, I don't  know that you've  actually taken like-kind treatment to be frank with  you. I think,  objectively, that might be viewed as just not reporting  certain  transactions.

You want to make sure that you address these issues sooner rather than later.

**1099-K forms can be misleading - to the recipient and, potentially, the auditor.** *\[32:40\]*

Alex:  A 1099-K is actually a merchant processing third party  information  returns. And it really is typically associated with people  who have  credit card sales - so it's going to reflect a gross amount and   typically on a monthly basis.

It shows  the gross amount and what I've seen too is that sometimes  transfers  actually get caught into that amount as well. So it's not even  just  gross sales or purchases -  it may have other information. So the   1099-K can be really inflated. That's why reconciling that against   accounting records is really, really important because that is one of   those issues that I think could lead to an exam.

**To those who think crypto isn't beholden to tax laws: you are not correct.** *\[37:38\]*

Alex:  The current commissioner of the IRS is Charles Rettig, and he's  a  really well known practitioner in tax controversy. I know from people   that know him well, that he's actually mentioned Reddit as one of the   reasons that cryptocurrency enforcement is his number one enforcement   priority right now.

The other person  that I've seen speak a couple of times is the head  of the IRS Criminal  Investigation Unit. His name is Don Fort and every  year he does a  presentation at the National Tax Controversy and Criminal  Tax  Conference. The last two years cryptocurrency has been number two  and  number one on his list. As much as the IRS lacks the funding and the   manpower that it needs for all the enforcement, the IRS CI are really,   really good and they are probably best agency at dealing with   cryptocurrency enforcement issues.

I  really think that it's gaining steam and I think once the audits  from  the Coinbase summons kind of get going, I think it's going to be a   really scrutinized area. I think the people who have gone through the   cost and the pain of disclosing and amending returns and doing   everything they can will be happy that they did in a couple of years. I   think the other people are going to be sweating it out - I don't know  if  it's ever really worth it to be honest with you. I would recommend   people do their best to get in compliance.

**In summary: do your best to report your crypto gains and losses - and don't try to pull one over on the IRS.** *\[42:36\]*

Alex:  For people who have potential issues with past years, one is  getting a  consistent record and just amending your past years, so  they're  consistent.

For people who have the  foreign account issues - let's just say, for  example, had an account  with Binance, and that Binance account was never  reported. The IRS has  disclosure programs that allow you to amend  certain returns, pay the  tax that you report and pay a penalty, which  would be 5% of the the  highest account value that you have.

For  people who don't want to deal with this, I think taking evasive  steps  is the best way to get the worst result possible. One of the  things  that I learned very early in dealing with audits and tax  compliance, is  that you can always make things worse. I think you really  just want to  address it and resolve the issue while you have a good  opportunity.

**We may see criminal prosecution of some of the ""big fish"" tax evaders from the Coinbase summons.** *\[46:43\]*

Alex:  Yeah, and I think the two things that I'm fairly certain we're  going  to see: one is we're going to see the IRS use the information  provided  by Coinbase to start auditing the biggest account holders from  that  period. I think that's very likely.

Probably  the second one that I would say is very likely is that  you're going to  see limited criminal prosecutions related to  cryptocurrency. And these  are going to be people that have some sort of  level of notoriety,  whether actually famous or maybe famous in the  cryptocurrency world.  That's typically how the IRS and Department of  Justice uses limited  resources to prosecute criminal tax tax crimes.

**Alex is a great guy to reach out to with any audit-related questions, crypto or otherwise.** *\[48:50\]*

Alex: You can go to my website: www.kugelmanlaw.com. You can email me at  Alex@KugelmanLaw.com.  I have clients all over the country, international  clients. If you  need any sort of help, whether that's representing you,  or at least  doing the nitty gritty audit investigation, we're always  willing to  talk to people and help them out as best we can.

I am 48 years old and would like to quit my full time job and focus on my health for at least 12 to 18 months and then take on part time work so that I can free up time to enjoy life on my terms.

We have 2.4M in property, 600K in super, 15K in shares and our annual living costs are around 100K.

We have a LOC set up with access to 650K and intend to use some of this as a LOE strategy.

Using the 4% rule we can both work part time and we have enough funds to carry us to when super kicks in which by then will be considerably more.

I have budgeted out all income and expenses for the next 20 years  and are comfortable with the numbers, capital appreciation at 3.5%, interest rates at 6% (loan)

My concern is that it is very hard to find anyone who supports taking this alternate approach to life (not working till a year before I die and prioritizing life not money)

Is there anyone out there who has shown the courage to implement FIRE at the back end or anyone who has successfully used a LOE strategy.

Im happy to give it a go and if need be go back to work more than part time if my calculations are wrong or if the things dont work out.

personalfinance,Tyro seeks advice for tax/bonus/income utilization,"Ok. . . I'm ready to be roasted and also to get some good advice for the second half of my life.  

&amp;#x200B;

3 person family.  13yo 8th grader (4 years to college).  

&amp;#x200B;

Assets : 

&amp;#x200B;

160k household income.

0 college savings.

Maybe 1k rainy day fund.

Standard contribution to 401k at work, maxing out the employer match.  Maybe 50k in 401k

Wife same 401k setup, maxing out employer match.  Maybe 40k in 401k.

Vested in pension that should max out at around 27k a year when I retire and is about 7k a year currently if I quit.

Wife vested in pension that should max out around the same \~25-27k when she retires and is probably around 10k a year now if she quit.

30k equity in a modest home purchased at the absolute peak of the market in 2008

&amp;#x200B;

Debts : 

&amp;#x200B;

9k in auto loan debt on the sports car that makes life worth living and won't ever be sold so don't try to convince me to sell it.

5k in personal debt for a furnace.

30k in student debt for wife.

\~7k in CC debt.

140k mortgage on home

&amp;#x200B;

Getting 17k back in taxes.  I have been taking out extra money each paycheck to ensure a big payoff at tax time.  Yes, I understand I should be at 0 and leverage my money more effectively.  This is just my way of forcing myself to save and hiding the money from myself.  Getting to 0 here is a goal, but I am going slowly and protecting my money from my idiotic instincts. 

&amp;#x200B;

5k bonus (take home).  

&amp;#x200B;

Typical household budget is 6k a month incoming and about 5950 a month outgoing.  Not being as efficient as we could and could probably trim 500 a month easily from the household budget by eating out less and being more sensible.  On a Dave Ramsey ""the only way you're seeing the inside of a restaurant is at your second job"" type plan, we could probably get by on \~4.5k with the biggest casualty being eating out and recreational activities.  

&amp;#x200B;

So . . . 22k incoming in a big chunk.  I was planning on the following.  

1.  All CC debt to 0 = -7k

2.  2k put on furnace debt (not sure why I want to do this.  Interest rate is OK, payment isn't onerous.  Just want to get closer to 0 debt).  = -2k

3.  Car fun stuff.  Car nut, makes my life enjoyable, I understand it's a bit of a foolish expense.  -1k.  

4.  5k into rainy day fund.  -5k

5.  2k or so in various ""when we get our taxes"" things for the year.  Pool membership (\~500), passes to amusement park (\~400), Couple luxury items for my son (\~400), Happy wife happy life (\~300), etc.  -2k

&amp;#x200B;

So I should have 5k ish left over after that.  I've got zero investments outside of 401k and I've been reading a lot about VOO and BLV and some other Vanguard funds.  Been watching Youtube videos on Robin Hood, Index funds, Vanguard, etc and I am still nowehere.  I have read some of Money Master the Game and I think I have a good idea about not rolling all my spare cash into my 401k given the fee structures there, but I am just struggling on how I should make a little bit off my money.  

&amp;#x200B;

My college goals for my boy are to pay at least some of his college.  He will need to work some, and we can take out some loans that we will help him pay off after school.  I don't have any hard and fast numbers there, but I know I will help.  That's incredibly nebulous, but it is what it is.  

&amp;#x200B;

So . . between my hopefully 5k left over and the 500-1500 I can surely squeeze out of my monthly budget. . . . what the heck do I do?  I wasn't planning on wiping out my wife's school debt immediately since the interest and payments are low and manageable.  Should I run the Dave Ramsey playbook and just crush out every single bit of debt immediately and then save/invest/etc?

personalfinance,Living abroad: good time for a Roth conversion?,"I am living outside the US for the next couple years and during this time I am officially not a resident of my previous state of California. Doing my taxes and thinking through various things, I considered... is this a good opportunity to do a partial Roth conversion?

To be clear, I am not in a super-low tax bracket. My marginal federal bracket is at 24%, and I make more than the limit for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. So I'd be paying 24% on the full conversion. Although I suppose that's better than ever given the tax cuts that went into effect last year? As I am not currently a resident of California, I don't have to pay California state taxes, or any state taxes for that matter, on the conversion -- this is why I'd consider it. My current home country (Singapore) would not tax this either.

That being said, I can see myself retiring outside the US as well (not necessarily Singapore; probably not Singapore). But this is a big unknown, along with future tax rates, as I'm only 30 y/o; retirement is a long ways away.

My retirement savings are as follows:

* Traditional IRA: Currently nothing; just used for a backdoor IRA

* Roth IRA: $40k

* Traditional 401k: $115k, of which about $60k is eligible for a rollover

The plan would be to rollover $20k out of the 401k and into a traditional IRA, and then convert it over to a Roth IRA, thereby paying $4800 in federal taxes next year. I figure, even though I'm not in a very low tax bracket, it's reasonable to expect that I will be at or above this tax rate in the future, especially if I consider any local taxes (state or otherwise) I might have to pay on the conversion. I also can afford the tax bill at this point. Further, that evens out the Roth and traditional accounts a bit (only a bit).

But is there something I'm missing? Is there some reason that the math would really work in my favor to just keep this money invested in a traditional account?",finance
personalfinance,Did my student loans get forgiven or did my credit just get irrevocably destroyed?,"My credit is trash due to a multitude of reason, some of which I caused, some of which I did not.

I recently checked my score and it was (expectedly) very low. I went to also check the outstanding accounts I had and noticed something odd. 

My student loan account had been closed.

Curious, I went onto my student loan account website and it confirmed that I had no outstanding balance and the account had been closed.

Now some important information:

-	I was not able to complete my degree -my federal aid was eventually denied and I dropped out because I got too sick to continue.
-	I’ve been out of school 2 years.
-	I have never made a student loan payment -my loans were in default.
-	My first college was a two year school that was eventually absorbed by a larger college.

So here I am now, very confused. I owed upwards of $15,000-$20,000. How can it just be *gone*?

My assumption is that is was somehow written off as bad debt and they shredded my score for it, but I don’t really know anything about credit so I’m not really sure if that’s something that they even *do* with student loans.

I keep seeing all these “ads” about people who went to -my first college- getting loan forgiveness and “people born before 1997” getting loan forgiveness and people who were Bio majors getting loan forgiveness, but I obviously never took them seriously.

So, does anyone have any idea what might have happened?

Edit: to add that this debt is not even on my credit report anymore. It doesn’t show that I owe more than like $800 total for all my debts, yet my score is still trashed? 

Edit: added more info

personalfinance,How is APR on a mortgage loan not a scam?,"I'm buying a house for the first time. So they gave me 4.8% interest on my loan yeah,
but I just came back from the bank signing everything and noticed the APR is 5.1%. As she was explaining everything she was about to turn the page without mentioning the APR, so I asked about it.
She didn't feel comfortable explaining the difference between the APR and the Interest rate so she asked someone else to come over and help explain it. Then their boss overheard them trying to explain it and came out to help explain it.
I don't know why they had so much trouble, its a classic bait and switch.
The APR is the actual rate after fees.
The loan comes with fees that have an interest rate all their own
that get averaged into the rate against the entire loan? The final actual rate is the APR.
I can't imagine why the fees have a separate interest rate at all
instead of just being, you know, a flat fee or why they would have any effect on the interest rate.
And then I'm certain there is no justification for averaging the rates together and applying that against the entire loan amount.
I know it is just a shady practice that has become standard because it took 3 people to try and explain how its not a scam, 
and I didn't even say anything beyond ""If thats my interest rate then what is this APR?""

personalfinance,401k Loan VS FHA Loan for buying a first time house.,"Hi. I'm looking to buy a home soon and in the process of being pre-approved the Loan Officer presented me two scenarios.

My initial plan was to use my cash savings (\~$20k) to pay for a small downpayment on an FHA loan and then try to pay off the 20% as quickly as possible. I was under the impression that once I had 20% of the loans value paid off; I would no longer have to pay PMI. The Loan Officer informed me that I would have to pay PMI on the entire loan. Is this correct?

His idea was to utilize a traditional mortgage and instead get a larger downpayment by having me take a loan from my 401k provider. My 401k currently has around $50k in it.  I put the data into [https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/](https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/). This plan overall is \~$10k less in total payments (assuming I don't pay any interest or taxes on my 401k downpayment money).  But it would make me pay about 37k more in interest over the life of the loan.

A few things bugged me about the interaction though. One, this plan has a higher interest rate and the guy felt very ""salesman""-like. He asserted that I'd have to pay PMI on the entirety of the FHA loan because of (and I quote) ""some sh\*t obama or bush, I forget"" repealed. This contradicts what I've read online in multiple places. When I asked him what the FHA loan was good for he said it was ""for people with shitty credit and no 401k"". He also left off the payment I'd have to make my 401k provider when he was giving me my monthly costs - so I am wondering if he's trying to pull wool over my eyes here. I know the average consumer cares a lot about monthly payments and picks the lowest one blindly.

This may just be paranoia from my distrust of most FIs though since the numbers do actually make sense. I'm just wondering if the legal-stuff would wind up hurting my 401k while his firm makes more money in interest.

These are the two scenarios he laid out for me verbatim from our emails:

    FHA- $312,660 @3.875%, 3.5% Down Payment, 1.75% Upfront Fee+ Standard Closing Costs= $1495.97 Principal &amp; Interest + $221.47 Mortgage Insurance (life of loan)= $1,717.44 (Not including property taxes or insurance)
    
    Conventional- $275,400 @4.5%, 15% Down Payment, Standard Closing Costs= $1,395.41+ $121.64 Mortgage Insurance (falls off after 20%)= $1,517.05 (Not including property taxes or insurance)

gaming,"I've almost finished BOTW, my second ever console game played! Please help me with what to play next?","Tl,dr: I've almost finished BOTW and loved it, and I would be super grateful for suggestions of what to get next (for switch)! I desperately don't want it to end so I thought knowing there's something waiting next would help haha. Also, I'm curious - are there other Zelda games with kinda similar gameplay to BOTW? I only just found out there are so many! 


Full story; 


I wasn't allowed to buy games as a kid/teen, so I don't know much about what's what. I bought myself my first ever console (a switch) and BOTW because I got to try it at a friend's house and loved it. I think I've nearly finished it (0/1, 4/4, 120/120) and I'm so sad about it, I wish I could wipe my memory so I could play it again for the first time. 


The things I really liked about BOTW: 

* It allows for and encourages creative solutions to problems, there's no one right way to approach an issue whether it be a puzzle or a battle.

* Combat where timing, movement, and tactics can be used and are helpful to use. Feels like you can actually improve the way you fight yourself, it's not *just* that you leveled up and now hit harder. 

* A nice balance where things aren't spoon fed to you - sometimes you have to run around trying out ideas to find a solution - but if you get too stuck there's normally a few hints around.

* It's really pretty

* Lots of choice about what you do, and when. 

* There's a story, and lore to discover


I also got to play journey on someone else's PS..uh..3? 4? (Sorry) a few years back and thought that was a suuuuuuuper cool, beautiful game. 


In terms of what I'm not so keen on, I once played through Pokemon red on my computer and (I'm so sorry, I know it's a classic and I am a pleb) I just didn't like it that much - I hated puzzles like the ice slidey caves because it felt more like grinding and frustration than being clever and creative. I hated waiting for it to load its text after every attack, I'm very impatient with that kind of thing. (Load screens on BOTW were also my least favorite part). And I didn't personally enjoy how ""winning"" was kinda a matter of ""how much info do you remember"" + ""how long have you been grinding.""  It felt like you were really constricted in your choices. So those are all things I think I personally don't enjoy in games which is why I suspect something like Let's Go! might not be the next choice for me (?) even though it seems popular.

Yet another student debt repayment question, I know, but I can't find a clear answer anywhere. Already checked the FAQ and scrolled through my google search results.

As I am about to finish up undergrad with $33,300 borrowed in private student loans (before interest), I'm worried that my variable interest rate will skyrocket if I defer it any longer and wait to refinance until after grad school. It has already climbed from 6% to 9% in the past year.

Based on my calculations, a 1.5 year MBS degree would require me to borrow just under $70,000 to cover tuition/books/part of my housing, even if I work part time throughout the year to cover food and the first half of my hypothetical $800/month rent. But.. my career prospects after graduation would open up positions paying $60k salary or more to start (cosmetic chemistry industry).

So back to my question: Is it possible for me to refinance my undergrad student loans and defer them until after I graduate with a MBS degree, or is the refinance option just for immediately paying it back? (To be clear, my private loans would allow me to defer during grad school but I'm just so paranoid about my interest rates climbing. I don't want to be in debt forever.)

Thank you in advance to the amazing people of reddit!",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my car?,I bought a 2016 honda civic touring for $20k. I have a 72 month loan with an interest rate of 10.38% APR. My credit score is at 695 right now. I'm currently paying 390 a month. I can't help but to think I got screwed over with that interest rate for my credit score at the time. I have the same credit score before I bought the car. I've had it for 7 months now.,finance
personalfinance,"Relocated to USA, where do I begin?","Hello all, I've recently moved from Australia to Washington, U.S.A for work and I'm trying to figure out how I should be arranging my finances over here as I'm quite clueless as to how things work. I've been trying to understand so many things like the 401(k), Roth, IRA, Roth IRA etc and I need a hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Salary wise I earn $140k as my base. I am receiving a bonus this year and the next but I don't want to factor that in for the long term.

&amp;#x200B;

My company has it's 401(k) plan with Vanguard and I have set it to contribute 13% of my income into it. My company matches my contributes $0.50 for every dollar up to 4%. Minus federal taxes and benefits I am left with approximately 10k take home income each month. Our health insurance is a shared deductible plan with an FSA that I contribute the absolute minimum required to.

I have close to 9k in my bank account here in the USA, about 5.7k USD in an Australian taxable investment account invested in a low cost ASX200 ETF and about 3.5k USD in savings in an Australian bank account. My superannuation in Australia (our 401(k) equivalent) has approximately $40k USD in it and it is invested in a low cost index fund focused allocation.

My wife who is not allowed to work until she receives her EAD has approximately 35.5k USD in a savings account that receives 2.8% interest. She also has about 19k USD invested an Australian taxable investment account divided between stocks and bonds with the larger piece of the allocation in bonds as she's conservative. Her superannuation is about $10k USD which doesn't seem much but she had only moved to Australia recently.

My wife and I both have approximately (as of today the 27th of Feb 2019) $2.1k held as Litecoin that we are HODL-ing.

&amp;#x200B;

We also own an apartment in Melbourne, Australia that we purchased just over 3 years ago for $345,000 AUD which still has $262,000 AUD remaining to pay off. It is currently being rented out to a tenant for $360 AUD per week. I make automated payments of $450 AUD per week on the mortgage and our minimum monthly instalment is $1553.35 AUD.

&amp;#x200B;

Expenses are:

Approximately $1650 USD per month in rent. Our apartment is about a 10 minute walk away from my office. There are no plans to buy a car, we are signed up with Zipcar and car2go in those cases where we would need to use a car. I have opened up a credit card with Bank of America that has a credit limit of 10k that we used to buy the furnishings in our home and currently has a $1800 balance on it that will be paid on its next due date around the 20th of March.

Apart from our mortgage in Australia, we do not have any Australian credit cards or personal loans.

Groceries according to our bank's budgeting breakdown graph is $950 for the last month. Our grocery spending habits back in Australia were around $650 USD a month as we frequented our local veg &amp; fruit market that had ingredients super cheap.

We eat out maybe twice a week at most and it is usually on the cheaper scale. The most we have ever spent on a single meal together is $40 USD with tips included, however we are quite content with going to Dick's Drive In for example and spending $14 in food and which is great!

&amp;#x200B;

We both have cell phones that we brought over from Australia that we own out-right. We are not looking to buy any new phones in the next few years. We're currently on a pre-paid plan with h2o wireless, $50 for 2 lines, unlimited calls and texts and 3gb of data that we share between us. We don't use cellular data much as we don't use social media and really only use it to send each other messages during the day. Most of which we are both under wifi coverage.

Home internet is covered for the whole year as a promotion of our leasing company for moving in however I received a copy of this year's bill and it is $550 a year.

We haven't received our other utility bills yet so no idea how much they cost so far.

We have subscriptions to Amazon Prime and use it to get discounts at Wholefoods, watching Prime Video and buying household consumables like laundry powder, water filters for our drinking water jug etc.

I'm subscribed to Humble Bundle and to a single MMO (Final Fantasy 14) which costs together about $30 a month at most.

&amp;#x200B;

So roughly:

Income: $10,000 USD

Expenses: Let's put a buffer on it and say $2000 USD but this is probably inflated because we've only been in the US for a little over a month and had to buy every household item we needed in the span of a few weeks.

Debts: $1800 USD on Credit Card.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the above information, any suggestions on what I do with the income that I'm receiving?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT #1: Received our first monthly utility bill for water/sewerage/trash:

Water: $13.51

Sewerage: $42.47

Trash: $14.09",finance
personalfinance,"Late 1099-C after filing taxes, will I need to refile?","So yeah I got this 1099-C after I did my taxes. The discharged amount is above the $600 threshold and is about 5% of my yearly income I claimed.

I'm pretty sure that I do but not sure if there is an easier process like calling the IRS and saying based on this how much do I owe now? I at least used H&amp;R block and have this print out though sadly my State filing is still not finished as H&amp;R block couldn't do it for some reason and I also have to pay with a check or something.

The other issue is that I didn't have cash/debit at the time and I paid by credit card the balance I owed to the IRS by making several small payment chunks through those federal payment sites. So that'll kind of suck but I guess ""they have my money"" so to speak and I just have to add more for whatever this 1099-C adds.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: the 1099-C is for last year eg. 2018 sadly

I say sadly if I wasn't a dumbass I wouldn't have this 1099-C to begin with",finance

Overall the loan works like a normal loan, and it's performed by a bank, who chooses the interest rate; and I am an immigrant from a shit country with not the highest income, I however take my financial decisions carefully; but of course they cannot see that, they cannot see my job is very stable (they just see a lower pay than average), they cannot see my investments (they just see money leaving my account fast), they cannot see my plans for growth, all they see is my salary, and how it vanishes as it comes, when I am moving it around to more useful environments. I might be making little but I am on fire, everything is going according to evil plans.

So part of my plan was to get a credit card, I know banks love credit, I don't, but that creates money out of thin air for them, so I'll just use credit as debit so they see my financial responsibility.

But other than that, what can I do?...",finance

personalfinance,Refinance Student Debt Options? High Income/High Loans,"(I tried positing this last night but can't find it anywhere on the sub)

I am doing some research to try to figure out some things here. Budget numbers below. Throwaway account as my normal account someone could figure out who I am and some people do know.

I am an attorney, been one for 4.5 years now, my wife is an attorney too and works for the government while I am in private practice. Gross household income is around $235k. We live in a top 10 metro area so fairly high COL. 

My parents were successful and well off, but lived a keeping up with the jones type life. The recession hit them hard and they took on a lot of debt while still trying to maintain a lifestyle. They were almost at $0 when they finally sold our home (for a big profit $3mil +) But there were debts to be paid new place to live etc..

I never thought I would be paying off my insane undergrad loans (that was never the plan) but here we are. I have graduate loans that are federal, I was ok with taking them and understood taking them on. I did not with the private student loans when I was 18-19 under my parents directions. I don't even remember signing any papers. 

Undergrad loans are $179k. I have now learned that for more than the past year almost no payments have been made and deferments kept being taken. My parents are co-signers and points of contact for the loan servicer, they always said don't worry about it, they are being paid. 

I took on interest only payments for 6-months to see if my parents could figure things out/turn things around. Not much has happened.

My federal loans are at $90k on an extended payment plan for now. $505/month. During my first two years as an attorney I actually focused on paying these down even though I was making half of what I earn now. And I did make a dent.

Undergrad: Multiple loans, all but one are at 6.75% fixed and one is a variable at 10.50% now and 38k remaining. The 6.75% is over four others totaling $141k.

$1,907.41 and rising in monthly payments + $505 in fed loans.

Other payments: 
$401 car loan $22k at 5.5% fixed 
$3,270 mortgage 448k at 4.375% 30-year fixed 
$120 0% interest financing on furniture 48-months. 
$475 0% interest for furniture 12-months will be paid off in 4-months. 

No other debt. 

My salary is around $90k with the remaining 30-40k coming in from business I bring in at 1099 rate. My wife is $110k gross. So some months we take home about $10,500 after taxes (W2 only) and other months it might be $12k or $18k it just depends when deals close.

Life gets in the way and a kid is on the way. Other expenses that are in there are around $350 for gas/parking, $330 for insurance (life/car), $100 for tolls, $400 cable/internet/light/water $350 groceries.

So now we are at $8,208.00 in expenses.

Ok not bad, but of course there is more to life than the above. I am budgeting $900 or so a month for the soon to be child expense, we do eat out for lunch and dinner sometimes, $650 or so. Then there are just other random things, repairs in the home, travel (though nothing planned) need a new suit, or new shoes, gifts for events, hair and nails, car repair etc.. Basically the way I see it unless I continue to increase my income (I can and hope to do) we will be in the top 5% of so household income earners barely saving anything.

My job has no 401k/retirement. My wife is placing the max up to the matching so she does not leave any money on the table. So right now that is our only current active retirement savings along with a potential future pension from her job.

The math I have is I can be somewhat comfortable getting the loan payments down to $1,200/month. I believe my parents can help out (the plan was always them pay it) a few hundred dollars (200-400) a month.

They know they help put me in a bad situation.

So where do I start looking at to find a fixed rate refinance that can get the $179k in private loans down to $1,200 or so in payment instead of the $2,000 and climbing I have now?

Does anyone refinance this amount? Should I just focus on refinancing the variable interest loan and leave the rest at 6.75%. They are all 15-year terms, where I know I have seen 20-year terms on refinance

Advice and criticism is appreciated.

We currently have a $12k emergency savings account. I have $23k in a ROTH IRA, she has her 401k from the gov job $23k and $17k in an IRA.",finance
personalfinance,Home Equity Loan for Roof Repairs,"I purchased a house two years ago @ 3.75% interest rate. At the time, the bank valued it at 20% higher than what I paid for it. I put 5% down and have been paying extra every month. 

I am going to have an expensive roofing project this summer and will not be able to save enough in time for it. It has to be done this summer to avoid any further damages next winter. 

My parents suggested a home equity loan, but I am unfamiliar with them. Is that a smart option? Since interest rates have gone up since I purchased the house, will my entire mortgage be on a new rate, or just the amount that I borrow against the homes equity?",finance
gaming,Would anyone want/play this kind of Pokemon game?,"Pokemon is one of those nostalgic games for me that I've been with since the beginning. But I've always had this pokemon game I've wished for, perhaps to come in the distant future:

Open world, third person, where you come across pokemon as enemies (such as finding bandits or monsters in other open world games). So you could find fire types near volcano biomes, or ice pokemon up north, etc. When you fight pokemon, they actually fight in real time, not turn based. Perhaps you actually take control of the pokemon you use, and can dodge attacks, etc. But even this I'm not too picky on, it could be turn based since that's the traditional style. But maybe pokemon still actually attack each other instead of remaining far apart for the most part and playing an animation and particle effect.

You can actually camp out with your pokemon out, like in the shows back in the day. You can cook up some chow and feed your pokemon and chill with them. If you sleep, eat, and keep your pokemon fed, that helps them level up faster or boost stats. So they seem more real and you can actually interact with them and do things. I was always so jealous of the shows of Brock and Ash and Misty camping out with their pokemon and feeding and just surviving together.

If you choose to have your pokemon out, they actually react to the environment (kind of like good followers from other games). So as an example: If you have a grass type out, and you're waking through a forest, they'll jump up into the trees and snag some berries. Or if you're walking by a river or lake, a water type would walk along the shore, splashing and having fun in the water. 

You and your pokemon actually have a complex/dynamic relationship system that effects combat. Not just walking around with them for X amount of steps and letting them not faint. There would be many activities throughout the open world of you guys surviving together and doing things together that would all help build this. And perhaps taking your pokemon to spend time in their natural biome makes them really happy as well. 

To not make this a novel (already kinda is haha): Basically a third person, open world, RPG with survival elements. You are actually thrown into the true world of pokemon trying to survive against the elements, build friendships, care for your pokemon like you would have to, and conquer all of these trials and tribulations to reach the top. Also, it would add a lot of exploration and discovering of activities and new heights to reach with your pokemon. 

I already know of the technical limits of something like this (tons of animations and other work for how many pokemon). But I was just wondering if anyone else would like a game like this? It's always fun to talk about Pokemon anyway :) Have a great day!

personalfinance,Need advice quick! About a CD,"My financial advisor is calling me at 11am (it is 10:40am here now). I’ve been meaning to post this but procrastinated because of who I am as a person... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Last time my financial advisor and I talked, he mentioned I should get a CD to save money, he basically called it a glorified savings account. I have my savings account from my bank and I guess I just don’t know if I should get a CD so it’s out of sight out of mind or if I should just continue saving in my current savings account? The interest is higher than my savings account now but I guess I just don’t have enough info from unbiased sources. Is this something I should get? Or is he just trying to get me to open accounts? My financial advisor is through Ameriprise. I don’t really have much temptation to take money out of my current savings account unless it’s to make a huge payment on my student loans. 
Any advice in the next 20 min would be very helpful! Lol thank you in advance 

Edit: For those asking, I have $35,000 in student loan debt. $11,000 of that is subsidized federal loans with fixed interest rates between 3.15% and 4.41%. The other $24,000 is a private loan which is an 11% variable interest rate (typing this makes me sad lol) I pay the minimum payment ($280-$300) every month and then make an additional payment with whatever money I have left over. For my additional payment I pay at least $260 extra a month on that one. In March I will have around $1000 extra to pay, so it just depends on the month (I am a nurse so I get paid by the hour=paychecks are not always the same)",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Amounts and Reimbursements,"[cross posted with r/ELI5]
I am trying to figure out how to pay for nursing school (I haven't applied yet, this is of course assuming I get in).

I'm not likely to get a lot of financial aid so I need to know about loans. I know there's a lifetime max for federal loans ($57,500) and I assume I can borrow up to that max. In my case, that remaining amount will not come close to covering what I need to cover.

The rest will have to be private loans but nobody can tell me how much I can take out until it's time to take the loan? How am I supposed to accept enrollment if I don't know if I can borrow enough to cover school and personal expenses? And we can only take out one semester at a time?

personalfinance,Student Loan Help - What Would Your Payoff Strategy Be?,"Hello all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a recent college grad looking for some advice on paying off these damn student loans. My current strategy is this:

&amp;#x200B;

I pay as much extra as I can toward the loan with the highest interest rate, and pay the monthly accumulated interest on all of the others. Once I completely pay off one, I'll move to the next highest interest rate and repeat. I make my payments the day I receive my paychecks (twice a month). I'm responsible for paying all of this, so disregard the ""parent"" part of the PLUS loan. Typically in total I will pay about $1,000/month combined towards all of these loans.

personalfinance,"Savings are growing, but still have Student Loans. Thoughts on how to proceed to make those savings grow?","Per the title- 

On 03/15 I'll have saved a little bit over $3k in my savings account. This money is transferred automatically every paycheck so I don't even see it. It's great, and I've loved seeing that number continue to grow. Background of me: live at home so no rent. I do pay for my phone and some food but those costs are minimal, like $75 a month. Really my only costs are car payment and insurance, gym membership, and a few costs here and there (like paying a Goodyear repair bill but that will end soon).

Problem is, I also have roughly $70k of student loans still on the books that I've been paying down for just over a year now. Those payments are just under $1500/month with me paying almost double the minimum to the highest interest rate loan.

I'd like to maximize my dollar as much as possible to set up for the future, but also these student loans are still very much in the present and near future.  I definitely could pay more to my loans since I have them set up to draw against my second monthly paycheck and the first paycheck is almost ""transaction free"", as in I don't have anything set up to pull when I get paid the first check of the month. But I also want to have some sort of life...

personalfinance,Should take out a home equity loan to pay off 28k of credit card debt?,"I’ve managed to accumulate 28k in credit card debt over the last five years. Now that my family’s income situation has become significantly better and more consistent, I am no longer using the cards. We have the means to easily cover the minimum payments each month and then some, but obviously doing so at the exorbitant interest rates is not ideal. I called my local credit union to ask about possible debt consolidation, and they offered me two options:

1. A 36-month unsecured personal loan covering $9300 of the debt at 10% interest. This would replace two of the three cards ($4800/24% and $4100/27%) with a much lower rate.

2. A 60-month home equity loan covering all $28000 with a fixed rate of 4.2%. This would replace all three cards ($19200/17%, plus the two above), but would be secured against 80% of my current equity in my home.

I’m nervous at the prospect of taking a second mortgage, but the prospect of saving thousands upon thousands of dollars and paying my credit card debt off in five years or less is pretty attractive.

We’re currently easily handling our monthly expenses. I use YNAB for home budgeting. We have a $1000 emergency fund, and have not added to our credit card balances for 6 months, so I’m confident we won’t just fall back into old habits.

personalfinance,LIRP vs. Brokerage Account,"My wife and I (late 20's) are re-evaluating our saving strategy. We've been maxing out our Roth IRA's since we've begun working, and have recently began maxing out our 401(k)'s in the past few years as well. Total, we have ~160k in retirement accounts. We own a home and are paying roughly double on our mortgage (interest rate of 4.2%), since paying that off early is a priority for us. However, due to being blessed by good careers, and hard work, we're finding our savings account keeps going up.

We've decided we want to retire early, and understand we need to begin saving for pre-retirement.

We also recently learned that our income as of this year puts us over the Roth IRA limit to contribute. We'd still like to contribute that amount towards retirement in someway.

In discussing this with my FA, they've recommended a LIRP, or drastically overfunding a life insurance policy. They stated the overfunding can be invested the same as a brokerage account, is tax sheltered, and can be withdrawn before 59 1/2. It sounds almost too good to be true, and I'm surprised I haven't heard of this until now. Which... makes me skeptical. It sounds like a Roth IRA without any contribution limit.

Two questions here - 

1. What other tax-benefited accounts exist for high earners?
2. Is a LIRP worth it, or would a standard brokerage account be better?

Our goal is to retire early, looking at low 50's or even 50. Ideally, we'd save such that we're covered between ~50 - 59 1/2, then have enough in our retirement accounts from there on.

- JL Warren said the first stage of financing will likely have a 3.9 percent interest rate, below the People's Bank of China benchmark rate of 4.35 percent. That should help Tesla get its assembly line running to produce its initial 250,000 lower-end Model 3 electric sedans.",finance
personalfinance,(CZ) Trying to file taxes from abroad,"Can someone please explain why my Adjusted Gross Income is around $3,000, but I owe $500 to the federal government this year?  Back story:  I have lived and worked in the Czech Republic for five years now, and every year, I always file form 2055 to claim exclusion on those foreign funds.   My only other income is on my 1099-MISC, which I file every year as well.  Every year up to now, my amount owed has been $0.   What changed???  The only thing I can think of is that I married a non-US citizen last year, which means that I have to file as married, filing separately.

personalfinance,Car Loan or Student Loan,"**Sorry for any errors I’m on mobile**

So I’m trying to decide which would make sense more and save the most money overall. I owe $30500 in student loans with an average interest over 8 loans of 4.54% The highest  loan is 6.5% and that is about $6000. I also have a car loan about 4.9% I believe and I owe just under 10k for it. Is it worth it to put more towards my car loan since the  term is shorter than out that balance towards my student loans or should I continue overpaying my student loans to reduce those since some of them have a higher interest rate.

personalfinance,Paying off student loans versus investing? Advice for a 22 yo recent grad please!,"I’m 22 years old and just graduated in May. I have zero financial assistance from my parents or family and never will, so keep in mind I have to be a bit more cautious about my money because I’m the only person who could bail myself out.

I work as an Executive Recruiter making commission so my salary is very unpredictable and varies (could be anywhere from 60K-150K a year). So far since August 2018, I’ve made 72K.

I currently have ~$7,000 invested in a Robinhood account doing well (up 16%).

I have ~$1,000 in an emergency fund/savings account.

I just became eligible to put money into my 401K with a 6% employer match and set that to automatically take 10% out of my paycheck and put it into a Roth 401K. 

I am $42,000 in debt from student loans. One of those loans is $26,500 and has an interest rate of 5%. One is $10,500 with an interest rate of 6.7%, and one is $5,000 with a 5% interest rate. 

I am single, have no children, and no other debt.

So my question is - how do I appropriately allocate my funds?? 

I’ve been sort of using the Dave Ramsey 20/30/50 method where I spend 20% of my money on groceries, fun stuff, etc., I save 30% of my paycheck and invest half of that (15%) in Robinhood and put the other 15% in an emergency fund, and use the other 50% for expenses which are roughly $1,500 a month including medical bills, student loan payments, rent, gas, phone, WiFi, all that good stuff! I dump all leftover money into my student loan with the highest interest rate at the end of the month.

Should I be investing more? Putting more towards my student loans? How much money should I save in a regular savings account for emergency funds? 

Any and ALL financial advice is welcome! I know next to nothing and am doing my best to be financially intelligent and disciplined. 

Thank you in advance!",finance

***Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown*** is a combat flight action video game developed and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. An entry in the long-running *Ace Combat* series. The game features support for virtual reality. The game takes place in the same fictional universe as the previous numbered games in the series. Following the events of *Ace Combat 04* and *Ace Combat 5*, the Osean Federation brokered peace between the military power of Erusea and the rest of the Usean continent. The IUN was formed to maintain peace across the Usean continent, while former President Vincent Harling orders a space elevator funded off the Erusean coast in order to revitalize the continent's economy. However, the space elevator creates resentment among the Eruseans, who see it as unnecessary Osean intervention.

Back in 2009, i used to play **Tom Clancy’s HAWX** as my first flight action game and I LOVE IT! So much that as soon as **HAWX 2** came, i brought it. Now after 9 years i got that feeling back again… Same feeling but it is improved that i had in 2009 - 2010. Here is my review on **Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros****:**

* **Story****:** The Story of Ace Combat 7 is not that awesome like Witcher 3 or something that near of games have but it is pretty good at its level, The Story events continue from AC4 and AC5 where the Osean Federation brokered peace between the military power of Erusea and the rest of the Usean continent. The IUN was formed to maintain peace across the Usean continent, while former President Vincent Harling orders a space elevator funded off the Erusean coast in order to revitalize the continent's economy. However, the space elevator creates resentment among the Eruseans, who see it as unnecessary Osean intervention.  If you have played the old games you will very well know what is happening in AC7 but for the first time players, the story might go unnoticed
* **Design****:** The Design of the levels have improved in many ways, The fights are intense and EPIC, Having only small areas to fly during a restricted missions are while not unique but better than it had in HAWX games and old AC games.
* **Dogfighting****:** Important thing on flight-action games are the way you shoot in the air while flying a plane and Ace Combat 7 does that job “ PERFECTLY ” 
* **Soundtrack****:** The Soundtrack, OH GOD! It's “Fantastic”, swelling during key moments of missions to get the blood pumping even harder. I’ve had the upgrade menu music stuck in my head all week which is a testament to the catchy but low key nature of the majority of the music in the game. It makes the soundtrack the best which 5 and 6 continued. it's a must-to-listen.
* **Audio Design****:** The Audio Design is **\*KreyGasm\*,** The sound of explosions, weapons firing, thunder, rocket sounds, flying through storm. No complaint in here.
* **Upgrading and New Planes****:** Each successful run at a mission earns credits which you can use to unlock more aircraft, weapons and parts. Choosing which aircraft to take into each mission can be critical, as you have a choice of 3 special weapons which can be a massive help when organised correctly, taking bombs into a mission focused on air to air combat would be pointless and sometimes a quick bombing run would get you back into dogfighting quick enough to avoid the tide turning against you. 
* **Performation****:** The Performation of the game on my PC was pretty great, i did not faced any crashes OR heavy frame-drops which allows aircraft to feel responsive and making hard turns without losing track of your target an enjoyable exercise. ( No Idea on performation on PS4 and Xbox )
* **Graphics &amp; Weather****:** The Graphics are beautiful to look at, The Clear sunny sky during morning missions to Heavy rain and Thunder at evening, Effects from weapon trails, impacts and launches light up and it’s not uncommon to have a dozen active fighters on screen. Icing up going through long clouds and blowing through an exploding opponent all benefit from the improved resolution and art assets, even towns look quite nice from mid range. It's one of the beautiful  Flight-action video game to date.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/buozb5fckdj21.png

* **Online multiplayer****:** The Multiplayer for AC7 is pretty good as well, The multiplayer allows up to eight players to dogfight either in Battle Royal (free for all) or Team Death-Match. While there are only two modes to play, the online seems to be pretty robust — I didn’t run into many issues at all, and it balances your aircraft’s loadout by assigning it a cost, which lobby creators can set restrictions on in order to prevent veterans from using top tier equipment.
* **Great Boss Fights****.**
* **Great Tech Tree ( Aircraft Tree )****.**

&amp;#x200B;

[Ace Combat 7 \( Aircraft Tree \)](https://i.redd.it/nr3e3zv8kdj21.jpg)

**--------------------------------------------------------------------------****-**

**Cons:**

* **Sparse checkpointing****:** The distance between each checkpoint is way apart as it will indeed get annoying to redo a 20 minute section multiply times on hard difficulty as well as on challenging missions. SO BE WARNED!.
* **Short Campaign****:** EVEN tho i loved the story “Ace Combat 7” Had, it felt way too short and ended way to quick. I simply wish it was longer
* **A few tedious missions****:** Some Missions are way to tedious to do, Example been the mission type called Annihilation where you had to kill a enough enemies to get certain point before you leave.
* **Timer during missions****:** The ‘Most Annoying’ part for me of the game is that each missions has a timer to finish it. It reduces the time i wanna spend to do a mission and makes me wanna rush it. I did not liked that part.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Final Verdict:**

**8 / 10 ( Excellent )**

**“****A MUST BUY****“**

Ace Combat 7 marks the spectacular return of a franchise that has been gone for far too long having a pretty good story, great customization and the best flight dogfighting you can get ( Reminded me a lot of back in times i had fun in HAWX games ). I Wish this success means we get “Ace Combat 8” pretty soon.

**Game is available to get on Steam, Playstation Store as well as on Xbox Game Store for $59.99**

personalfinance,Paying Cash Vs Financing,"Hey all,

Looking for a little help understanding at what point would it would make sense to pay cash for something.

Lets start with a car:

Say the car cost $20k, and I have 25k in the bank. And lets imagine an interest rate on financing like 4%. Would it make sense to just pay for the car outright? or would it still be smarter to put like 20% down and finance the rest?

Similar Question with a house:

200K house, 200k in the bank, mortgage @ 5%. Is it ever smarter to just buy the house outright?

This is all hypothetical, I don't have the money for a car, never mind a house. I'm just trying to understand why it wouldn't be better to just own something outright, rather than have to make payments on it when you have the cash in hand.",finance
personalfinance,"My car was totaled, insurance is offering enough to cover the loan amount, but doesnt leave much for a down payment on new car.","Hi, first time posting here so not sure if theres a better place/flair to post this. Long story short, I got rear-ended on the highway last week. Contacted insurance and made my claim, the estimate to fix the damage to my vehicle was over $11K (got rear-ended at a light coming off the highway). My car was a 2017 and I bought it brand new, and it had less than 13k miles on it. Insurance company decided to total it due to the estimate to fix it and my rental vehicle being more than its Kelly Blue Book value. Insurance also is only giving me a rental until this Monday (March 4th), and I've had the rental since the accident (Feb 21st). I had an auto loan for 0% interest rate for the length of the loan. My insurance is paying my $22k for the total loss settlement. I owe $21k on the loan, so I'm approximately $1k on the upside, however I'm not in a place financially to place a down payment on a car, and I don't have a good enough credit score anymore to qualify for a 0% interest loan. So I guess I'm really asking if theres anyways for me to negotiate with insurance company to get more money from the total loss settlement, especially since I wasn't at fault, and I'm basically being forced into a situation where I would be getting a loan that has interest. Both myself and the other driver have the same insurance provider (USAA) if that matters. I'm also curious if I can ask for the rental to be covered for a longer period of time, basically until I can get another car.",finance
